"finally , opportunities and obstacles are identified and accompanied by suggestions for how to look for species jumps .","to answer the question of where to look , prospects for discovering emerging viruses among wildlife , bats , rodents , arthropod vectors and occupationally eed humans are discussed ."
"most emerging human diseases are zoonoses , which are infections caused by pathogens of animal origin .","early detection of potentially high - risk pathogens within animal hosts or vectors could enable mitigation strategies to prevent a species jump to humans , such as avoidance of high - risk areas , prophylactic drug distribution or timely mobilization of surveillance and medical resources to cope with emergent disease ."
"during a spillover event , humans become infected with zoonotic viruses to which they are susceptible but are rarely eed and which do not efficiently transmit from human to human .",there are two distinct phenomena that result in human infection by zoonotic viruses : spillover events and species jumps .
"most zoonotic surveillance efforts are reactive , collecting incidence data from people who are already sick and seeking animal sources of pathogens that have already spread to humans .","by contrast , predictive surveillance efforts aim to identify ecological conditions ( e . g ."
"to answer the question of where to look , prospects for discovering emerging viruses among wildlife , bats , rodents , arthropod vectors and occupationally eed humans are discussed .",canine parvoviruses as well as seasonal h3n2 and pandemic h1n1 influenza viruses are discussed below as exemplars that suggest what to look for in anticipating species jumps .
"this process has been termed ' epochal evolution ' , as the discovery of new antigenic phenotypes depends on periods of extensive genotypic change with generally minor but occasionally dramatic effects on phenotype .","another hypothesis is that punctuated antigenic changes in ha may precipitate selective sweeps , allowing sufficiently novel mutants to outcompete related strains of the same subtype ( koelle et al . , ) ."
how are the patterns of seasonal influenza in humans useful to predict species jumps ?,"understanding the dynamics of influenza in human hosts sheds light on the potential of the human population to be infected by new strains , the probability that a spillover virus can acquire evolutionary adaptations to facilitate spread in humans and the abilities of intermediate hosts ( such as chickens and pigs ) to generate pandemic viruses ."
"shortly after its detection in humans , the h1n1 pandemic influenza a virus ( a / h1n1pan ) was determined by phylogenetic analysis to have arisen from combinations of viruses that previously infected human , swine and avian hosts ( dawood et al . , ) .",data collected from the h1n1 influenza pandemic may provide new insights into its tropism and virulence mechanisms .
"while those viruses are not infectious to humans , these viruses are known to have made a species jump from cats to dogs and also to raccoons .","their small , single - stranded dna genomes ( comprised of two genes that encode four proteins ) and widespread occurrence among domestic and wild carnivores make the parvoviruses particularly useful as models for understanding how species jumps occur ."
"however , further research to elucidate the genotype - phenotype relationships for other viruses must be undertaken to determine how to identify viruses with altered host range properties .","as many zoonotic viruses bind to animal host receptors for which orthologous receptors exist in humans , laboratory studies using pseudotyped zoonotic viruses in human cell systems may reveal genotypic and phenotypic changes that enable tropism shifts ."
"however , in these and other examples , the sources of any viral samples collected for analysis are crucial for detecting informative changes .",the preceding section uses specific examples of species - jumping viruses to suggest means by which viruses adapt to new host species .
"these data were compiled before the emergence of a / h1n1pan in in mexico , but as more geolocated virus sample information becomes available , biogeographic relationships may be revealed and predictors identified .","these investigators and others ( kuiken et al . , ) suggest that surveillance efforts can be rationally focused both geographically and based on income ."
the ability to make correlations between homologous viruses transferred between proximal species will be fundamental to predict species jumps .,"zoonotic surveillance efforts focused on hotspots , such as those undertaken by investigators from the u . s . centers for disease control and prevention ( discussed below ) and the global virus forecasting initiative , offer evidence that such efforts provide information that makes predictive surveillance feasible ( wolfe et al . , ) , including discovery of a novel retrovirus in monkey and human populations ( sintasath et al . , ; zheng et al . , ) ."
"this rich species diversity , plus other ecological traits ( high population densities and reproductive rates ) , suggests that surveillance efforts focused on rodents and bats could offer high value .","of the more than four thousand known mammalian species , ~ 50% are rodents and ~ 25% are bats ."
"in this case , rodents commercially captured in forested areas of southern ghana were the sources of the us outbreak , and a study by the us cdc found that % of nearby human residents had been previously eed to orthopox viruses ( reynolds et al . , ) .","also , one human case was acquired from a rabbit that became infected when eed to a prairie dog in a veterinary setting ."
"furthermore , geographic information system - based maps that layer environmental measurements ( temperature , precipitation , land use ) and vector / host distribution data can be used to inform rational decisions about when and where surveillance samples should be collected .","this approach has been used to correlate environmental factors with competent west nile virus vectors trapped in urban areas of the north - eastern united states ( brown et al . , a , b ) ."
"immunity acquired among members of this ' front line ' group , whether through symptomatic or asymptomatic infection , would alter the dynamics of infection and the spread of zoonotic pathogens .","there are occupations whose members are frequently ( and in some cases continually ) eed to zoonotic viruses , including veterinarians , farmers , ranchers , tanners and food processors ."
"found that farm workers , veterinarians and meatprocessing workers all had greatly elevated serum antibody levels for swine isolates of h1n1 and h1n2 , compared with controls .",extension of serological surveys to other at - risk occupational groups could help define a baseline frequency of spillover by influenza and other zoonotic viruses .
"in the short term , increased use of advanced pcr techniques ( including masstag and tiger ) should improve surveillance for zoonotic spillover events .","in the long term , an open access repository resource , into which practitioners could deposit viral , vector or host sequence data , could be hosted to facilitate in silico longitudinal analyses ."
"deriving predictive value from genetic sequences will require elucidation of the complex relationship between genotype , phenotype , pathotype and ecotype ( pepin et al . , ) .",overreliance on genomic ( versus phenotypic ) studies will not enable prediction of which viruses will jump to new host species .
"prediction requires inputs derived from many disparate bioscience fields ( virology , ecology , evolutionary and computational biology , immunology , veterinary science , wildlife biology , etc . )",that have little history of collaboration or current impetus to do so .
"a transdisciplinary permanent working group could encourage and promote orthogonal approaches to key research questions , including : can laboratory viral adaptation in animals or cell cultures be used to model species jumps ?",new predictive biosurveillance supply / demand architectures could achieve real progress in this area .
"canine parvovirus infection of mammalian hosts is a candidate system , with known molecular changes that resulted in tropism shifts , sustained transmissions between animal populations and species jumps .","for example , holistic study of a simple virus - host system across molecular , genetic , organismal and population levels can yield insights into how viruses overcome barriers across these levels to jump hosts ."
"furthermore , data from basic laboratory studies can support the discovery , development and testing of computational models that fuse essential biological , ecological and evolutionary phenomena .","multidisciplinary teams should organize to curate data sets , build and validate new models , improve extant models and most importantly , define data requirements for future predictive models that could be used to drive new sample collection requirements and algorithm improvements ."
"to conduct predictive surveillance in the long term , practitioners must lay the groundwork for optimizing surveillance efforts in the short term to include laboratory analyses that can detect tropism shifts or other changes that may preclude species jumps .","for example , plans could be made to process and share currently collected virus samples with multidisciplinary teams for longitudinal genomic analyses ."
they further suggest that biosurveillance systems tailored to recognize salient changes in viral fitness for alternative hosts could cue early warning of species jumps .,"the emergence of a / h1n1pan in north america highlights the uncertainties and challenges in predicting whether spillover events can lead to species jumps - yet , understanding the sources of new viruses is critical to understanding how they emerged ."
this review examines the future of predictive surveillance for viruses that might jump from animal hosts to infect humans .,canine parvoviruses as well as h3n2 and h1n1 influenza viruses are discussed as exemplars that suggest what to look for in anticipating viral species jumps .
pnas have also been found to replace dna probes in varied investigative purposes .,"there are several disadvantages regarding cellular uptake of pna , so modifications in pna backbone or covalent coupling with cell penetrating peptides is necessary to improve its delivery inside the cells ."
"since the pna backbone does not contain any charged phosphate group , the absence of electrostatic repulsion gives rise to a stronger binding between pna / dna strands than that of dna / dna duplex .","the attached nucleobases are natural and so through watson - crick base pairing can bind to complementary dna / rna ( egholm et al . , ) ."
"pna is neither a nucleic acid nor a protein and it can withstand both nucleases and proteases ; so has become a potential biomolecular tool with a superior lifetime for in vivo and in vitro applications such as , molecular diagnostics and antisense therapeutics ( janson and during , ) .","artificial pna oligomers which generally require - 25 bases oligonucleotide probes have been used frequently in diagnosis , molecular biology procedures , antigene and antisense therapies ( marchelli et al . , ) ."
"furthermore , charged pnas have been developed to enhance the solubility and cellular delivery by introducing groups like phosphates ( shiraishi et al . , ) and guanidium ( katritzky and narindoshvili , ) in the backbone .","on the contrary , introduction of cyclopentyl ( pokorski et al . , ) , ( 2 s , 5 r ) - aminoethyl pipecolyl ( shirude et al . , ) , prolyl ( corradini et al . , ) derivatives were found to improve binding affinity ."
thus pnas having chiral entity possess many properties essential for the detection of point mutations and selective binding in diagnostics and therapeutics .,"by linking different parts of pna backbone , the effect of chirality and conformational restriction on the binding affinity of pna can be determined ( table ) ."
"thiouracil along with , 6 - diaminopurine has also been utilized as a base pair in recognizing pna / dna which finally led a phenomenon termed as ' double duplex invasion ' .","hypoxanthine ( sanders et al . , ) , n4 - benzoylcytosine ( olsen et al . , ) and - thioguanine ( henrik et al . , ) represent some more examples of modified nucleobases ."
"due to the ability to interact with the selected target with large sequence specificity in a gene sequence , pnas are of great interest in wide range of applications in medicinal and biotechnological areas .","they are highly promising in the eansion of gene therapeutic agents , diagnostic and molecular tools for genetic analysis ."
antigene therapy using oligonucleotides have targeted various viral agents at the transcription step .,"in the race of finding potential antiretroviral agents , pna oligomer ( 15 bases in length ) , conjugated to a nuclear localization signal ( nls ) was found to significantly suppress hiv - 1 replication in chronically infected lymphocytes and macrophages ."
"for instance , pna with - amino - 6 - o - 2 - vinylpyrimidine at terminal position was found to possess excellent and selective crosslinking reactivity with thymine - dna ( fig .",interstand crosslinking in nucleic acids is one strategy for preparing a stable duplex between pna and dna / rna to be targeted through covalent bond formation either by photolysis or in oxidative conditions .
this is related to the amplification of mycn which could be decreased in cell lines by rna interference and antigene pna ( agpna ) attached to a nls peptide .,specific nuclear delivery of the pna was shown by fluorescence microscopy in six human neuroblastoma cell lines : sj - n - kp and nb - 100 ( mycn - nonamplified / less - eressed ) ; gi - li - n and imr - 32 ( mycn - amplified / over - eressed ) and gi - ca - n and gi - me - n ( mycn - unamplified / uneressed ) .
"furthermore , agpnas could also be introduced for the purpose to silence eression with mrna targeted pnas or sirnas ( janowski et al . , ) .","according to a recently published article , pna conjugated to nls ( pkkkrkv ) was found to suppress rad51 eression in multiple myeloma and act as potential candidate in multiple myeloma chemotherapy ( alagpulinsa et al . , ) ."
"it is done by using different ways to prevent disease onset or arrest disease progression and the first clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy showing promising results ( rigo et al . , ) .",there has been a recent revival of concern in the application of antisense oligonucleotides to treat or prevent numerous genetic disorders or infections .
antisense pnas as antibacterial agents were found to treat infections caused by multidrug resistant bacteria .,pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common and clinically important pathogens due to its resistance to an extensive variety of antibiotics .
recent studies also revealed the potential of duplex dna - invading pnas for the identification of both bacterial and fungal pathogens directly from blood without any need for culturing which is time consuming .,"this approach would help in improving patient ' s health by fast and appropriate antimicrobial intervention ( n lling et al . , ) ."
"thiazole forms pna probe that fluoresced upon hybridization ( k hler and seitz , ; jarikote et al . , ) .","can hydrogen bond with uracil and thymine in the reverse watson - crick mode and being inherently fluorescent , can be used to study the kinetics of the hybridization process with complementary nucleic acids ( gangamani and kumar , ) ."
campylobacter jejuni is the chief pathogen that enters the human body through food causing millions of cases of infection .,"a resistancenodulation - cell division ( rnd ) - type multidrug , cmeabc efflux pump resulted into the resistance to potential antibiotics in campylobacter ."
"micro - rna consists of - 24 nucleotides , are regulatory rna and increase or decrease in their eression have been found to be associated with various diseases .",microrna - 155 ( mir - 155 ) regulates various pathways associated with immune - regulation and multiplication of the cell but it ' s over eression causes various tumors .
"this inhibition of the gene was done on the mrna translation and protein eression level ( huang et al . , ) .","in another citation , it was also concluded that i labeled apna could inhibit the overeression of cerbb - 2 proto - oncogene in human ovarian epithelial cancer cell lines skov3 ."
"recently , an apna was synthesized which targeted the hbv direct repeat ( dr ) sequences .",tat - pna - dr efficiently inhibited the replication process of hbv in hepg2 . 2.15 cells in vitro and in vivo .
"in medical and biological research laboratories , polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) is a frequent technique to amplify a dna target sequence , generating thousands of copies for a variety of biomedical applications .","pna - mediated pcr clamping was also used for the amplification and consequently identification of minor allele in blood chimerism whereas direct sequencing of ordinary pcr product could not identify it ( sano et al . , ) ."
"the balancing pna probe used in this assay selectively blocked the increase of ervwe1 ( another member of herv - w family ) , resulting in the specific detection of msrv .",they utilized the complementary pna probe which did not obstruct the amplification of msrv .
"pna clamping was also found to show higher and accurate detection rate for epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) gene mutations as compared to direct sequencing in patients with non - small cell lung cancer ( yoon et al . , ) .","pna clamping was used in detecting mutation in gene gnas1 that causes mccune - albright syndrome , a disorder which affects bones , skin and endocrine tissues of patients ( mukai et al . , ) ."
pna - fish methodology was also used for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis which is a common vaginal infection .,"the method was found to be time saving , highly specific and provided a valuable and trustful diagnostic tool ( machado et al . , ) ."
"they prepared the assay using pna technology coupled to immune - fluorescence microscopy , thereby improving the diagnostic resolution and clonal prevalence study .","recently , rosso and group ( rosso et al . , ) developed an assay for the specified detection at a single cell level of bcr - ablt315i mutation that causes chronic myelogenous leukemia ."
a double stranded pna - dna was produced by the selective hybridization of this probe with a complementary sequence in solution which was further used to detect the target dna sequence .,the hepatitis c virus genotype a core / e1 region based - mer pna probe was covalently attached on the electrode .
"furthermore , - trifluoromethyl - derived biosensor was prepared by incorporating trifluoromethyl and , 3 - bis ( trifluoromethyl ) - 4,4 , 4 - trifluorobut - 1 - ynyl groups on pna strand .",the applicability of biosensor was studied by f nmr spectroscopy due to the appearance of distinctive f resonance shifts in nmr upon pna targeting to complementary dna / rna .
this resulted in a - 3 orders of magnitude improvement in detection sensitivity as compared with earlier reported immobilization free dna biosensors .,"the superior sensitivity in combination with the operation convenience made this method a promising alternative for development of integrated , miniaturize , portable and low cost dna detection devices ."
"in this hybridization based method , charged neutral pna were used as a "" coagulant "" of citrate anion - coated particles and the assay was validated using gold ( au ) and silver ( ag ) nanoparticles ( nps ) .","colorimetric assay is another important method of dna detection which is based on the aggregation of unmodified metallic nanoparticles ( kanjanawarut and su , ) ."
then the enzymatic digestion with successive eure of the surface to chi - fc signified the presence of snps with a good detection limit of fm ( s / n = ) .,"the hybridized pna - dna gold electrode ( aue ) surface enabled the electrostatic attachment of chi - fc to the negatively charged phosphate backbone of dna resulting into a sharp electrochemical oxidation signal from ferrocene at 0 v . the nonspecifically adsorbed snp dna was effectively removed by eing the surface to a nuclease s1 , a specific nuclease for ssdna ."
"recently , a group has utilized pna / dna hybridization directly in solution using unmodified au nps for dengue virus detection ( rahman et al . , ) .","in this novel optical detection method , neutral charged pna was coated on aunps surface causing immediate aggregation in solution ."
"these generated pna - nanoconjugates were found to possess great potential for varied biomedical applications ( prencipe et al . , ) .","these magnetic nanosensors could be easily delivered to a desired target by simply applying controlled external electromagnetic field , providing a novel method of selective dna recognition ."
"researchers have demonstrated the application of combinatorial self assembly of pna - encoded carbohydrate fragments in accessing the complex glycan arrays ( huang et al . , ) .",these pna - tagged glycan arrays were prepared from native oligosaccharides in a two to three step process .
"these hybridized pna molecules act as photochromic compounds by their modification with a single azobenzene , the most studied class of photochromic molecules .","hybridization of pna with dna gives rise to the formation of pna based photosensitive compounds which have noteworthy potential in research and diagnostics , medicines , biotechnology and nanotechnology ( stafforst and hilvert , ) ."
"in this technique , the unlabeled rna was hybridized to the pna microarray .","this was further labeled by enzymic ligation of pcp - cy3 on the chip , resulting into the analysis of eression profiles with high fidelity ."
"it was observed that on addition of cu + , the thermal stability of hairpin structure was hardly affected whereas the stability of pna / dna bimolecular triplex structure was drastically destabilized .",this conjugate was specifically designed to structure a pna / dna bimolecular triplex and a hairpin .
it was found that - pna binding to complementary dna and rna was favored thermodynamically which resulted in a stronger binding than unmodified pna .,"it might be due to the fact that the l - modified structure matched the preferred right handed helicity of dna and rna duplexes ( lusvarghi et al . , ) ."
"moreover , it was also shown that dual labeled pna probes can effectively be used for mutation detection through melting point analysis ( hur et al . , ) .",another concept of pna based hybrid hydrogels was introduced by chu and co - workers .
"the ed environment is full of interruptions , with multiple interactions and a high density of decision - making .",it is a place where neither its volume nor pace of work can be predicted .
"however , the ed would grind to a halt if its practitioners were to attend to one patient from entry to exit prior to attending to the next patient .","at the first level , practitioners care for patients one at a time : it is a one - to - one relationship when the practitioner is with the patient ."
"ed teams work in a dynamic domain of healthcare as they work under conditions that change frequently , may be assembled ad hoc , have a dynamically - changing team membership , and have to integrate different professional cultures .",it is recognized that team performance is crucial to providing safe patient care .
"most eds have a common staff pantry , others organize celebrations and trips , and a few have open offices , which allow team members to socialize .",it is important for ed senior management to create opportunities for ed team members to meet and mingle informally .
the majority of ed staff recognizes the importance of teamwork and communication in their work in improving patient safety .,"communication within the ed is a challenge as practitioners work in an environment with a high - velocity , where multitasking is the order of the day , and interruptions are the norm ."
", informal interactions create the opportunity for casual dialogue that tends to flatten out the authority gradients between individuals .",one way to do this is to provide opportunities for team members to interact under informal circumstances to become familiar with one another .
ed practitioners interact with each other as well as with members from other departments and agencies .,resolving conflicts constructively can give rise to new opportunities and can lead to less stress for the ed team .
the organizational structure of an ed is known to have an impact on the interaction between the different professions within the team .,"seow described the three types of organizational structures her ed team had eerienced ( silo , matrix , and business unit center ) as well as the strengths , weaknesses , opportunities , and threats ( swots ) of each ."
"we are all aware that when the lead physicians and lead nurses in an ed have a collegial relationship , a sense of camaraderie tends to cascade to the rest of the team .","the corollary would then be that when the relationship between the lead physicians and lead nurses in an ed is less than cordial , the interactions between the two groups would generally not be optimal ."
"the senior management of a hospital may have feelings of insecurity if they find it difficult to "" control "" the ed .","the ed is the "" shop window "" and a door to the hospital ."
"it is important for ed senior management to know the "" movers and shakers "" in their organization and to have a proactive approach rather than a reactive approach towards them .",the state of the relationship between the ed senior management and their hospitals will have a bearing on the amount of resources the ed will receive .
these are now the norms rather than the exceptions compared to the early years of emergency medicine practice .,the literature e22 elores the outcomes of the adoption of a few clinical decision support rules and their acceptance by practitioners .
"there is a great temptation for some ed senior management to introduce standard of operations , protocols , and clinical decision support to as many conditions as their teams may encounter .","the work in the ed is unbounded , involves multiplicity ( caring for numerous patients with highly variable complaints simultaneously ) , is characterized by a high level of uncertainty ( dearth of background information about patients and the need to make difficult decisions before critical data may be available ) and care is provided under significant time constraints ."
they should not have to be distracted by misplaced or inadequate equipment or supplies .,"for example , time is wasted when practitioners have to walk around their ed looking for gloves when they are about to carry out a procedure ."
"standardizing the layout of consultation , resuscitation , and other work areas will also contribute to this efficiency .",the placement of equipment and consumables within the ed will have an impact on the efficiency of its practitioners .
one of the unique responsibilities of the ed senior management is to plan and prepare for disasters .,wardrope and mccormick listed a contingency planning for rare emergency events as one of the core activities of emergency medicine .
"ed senior managers must ensure that their departments plan , prepare , practice , review , analyze , assess , and strategize for these possible events .","in the past decade , the world has encountered terrorist attacks , earthquakes , infectious disease outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) , transport accidents , etc . , and in all these events eds were one of the first agencies involved ."
"if the layout of the working areas cannot be changed , the routes patients have to take into , within , and out of their ed should be planned .","when planning the layout of the various working areas within the footprint of their department , ed senior managers must take into consideration the composition of their patient population and the flow of the various subgroups into , within , and out of their ed ."
eisenberg et al recommended that creating a workable backstage area for completing conversations could mitigate concerns and lessen misunderstandings and mistakes .,the physical environment was identified as a source of significant communicative vulnerability .
one way to enhance the security of the ed staff is to provide separate entry and exit doors from the public .,there is always a risk that the ed team may encounter aggressive members of the public .
"ed senior managers must arrange and ensure that their team receives the same level of support during and outside office hours , on weekdays and weekends .","this must be emphasized to the supporting departments , like housekeeping , facilities , etc ."
christmas et al found that having a consultant working nights resulted in reduced process times and a decrease in the rate of admission .,"in this site , the consultants volunteered to cover the night shifts and received extra remuneration for doing so ."
""" most people entering medicine and nursing do so with some belief that they will be able to help people ( i . e . , they should be more internally driven by the desire to do a good job than need constant external monitoring ) . ""","this "" target number "" is often the average number ( or slightly higher ) of patients attended to by the rest of the team ."
"first , teams require leaders who are energetic and enthusiastic , and have a vigorous drive .","next , certain leadership skills such as giving recognition for performance , getting to know team members well , and creating an enjoyable work environment can inspire and motivate teams , and the third , creating flexibility in working methods as long as service quality and output are not compromised ."
"contrary to popular belief , it is not only leadership skills that are required to inspire and motivate teams but also management ones .","when leaders and managers fail to inspire and motivate their teams , there can be problems with staff retention , burnout in their team members , underperformance , poor quality service , inefficiencies , etc ."
ed senior management must both lead and manage to ensure that its teams deliver the best possible care to patients and continue to do so even during rare emergency events .,"organizational effectiveness depends upon having both leadership and management skills , and having them in an appropriate balance ."
"the change should be introduced at an appropriate time , as this is vital .","when managing change , ed senior managers will have to accept that not all individuals will be won over at the same time ."
"however in a crisis , team members must be able to comply fully and immediately .","during the sars outbreak in , change was the norm for the ed team in tan tock seng hospital in singapore ."
the most important part of any organization is the people who make it work .,change works only if it takes root in the hearts and minds of the organization ' s people .
the ed environment can also stay chronically in chaos and rarely hums with resonance .,"in conclusion , the ed environment can move from order to complexity to chaos and then back again within a very short period of time ."
"at present , there is no accurate estimation about how long the covid - 19 situation will persist , the number of individuals worldwide who will be infected , or how long people ' s lives will be disrupted ( suicide awareness voices of education , ; zandifar and badrfam , ) .",healthcare systems in many countries have been pushed to breaking point in an attempt to deal with the pandemic .
"in extreme cases , such mental health issues can lead to suicidal behaviors ( e . g . , suicidal ideation , suicide attempts , and actual suicide ) .","these are the common features of typical mental health suffering that many individuals will eerience during and after the crisis ( ahorsu et al . , ; banerjee , ; cheung et al . , ; xiang et al . , ) ."
"due to the social avoidance and attitudes by others around him , he committed suicide by hanging himself from a tree in the village near his house .","on march , after returning from dhaka , a - year - old bangladeshi man ( zahidul islam , from the village of ramchandrapur ) committed suicide because he and the people in his village thought he was infected with covid - 19 based on his fever and cold symptoms and his weight loss ( somoy news , ) ."
"given that the victim believed he had covid - 19 , it is also thought that he committed suicide out of a moral duty to ensure he did not pass on the virus to anyone in his village .","although xenophobia is usually defined as a more specific fear or hatred of foreigners or strangers , xenophobia is actually the general fear of something foreign or strange ( in this case covid - 19 rather than the victim ' s ethnicity ) ."
"a very similar case was reported in india on february , where the victim , returning from a city to his native village , committed suicide by hanging to avoid spreading covid - 19 throughout the village ( goyal et al . , ) .","based on these two cases , it appears that village people and the victim ' s moral conscience had major roles in contributing the suicides ."
suicide is the ultimate human sacrifice for anyone who cannot bear the mental suffering .,"however , the fact that the fear of having covid - 19 led to suicide is preventable and suggests both research and prevention is needed to avoid such tragedies ."
"this would help in developing targeted mental wellbeing strategies ( e . g . , such as those who live in villages ) .","we would suggest there is an urgent need to carry out a nationwide epidemiological study to determine the level fear , worry , and helplessness , as well as other associated issues concerning mental health in relation to covid - 19 ."
"finally , as suggested by banerjee , the role of a psychiatrist during a pandemic such as covid - 19 should include as ( i ) educating individuals about the common adverse psychological consequences , ( ii ) encouraging health - promoting behaviors among individuals , ( iii ) integrating available healthcare services , ( iv ) facilitate problem - solving , ( v ) empowering patients , their families , and health - care providers , and ( vi ) promoting self - care among health - care providers .","we would also recommend online - based mental health intervention programs as a way of promoting more reliable and authentic information about covid - 19 , and making available possible telemedicine care , as suggested in recent previous papers ( liu et al . , ; xiang et al . , ; yao et al . , ) ."
"this includes private and public efforts , both in the united states and through collaborations with other research bodies around the world .","as part of this effort , president bush ' s ' project bioshield ' bill will invest up to us $5.6 billion during the next decade into researching new preventative treatments ."
"despite this , smallpox still poses a significant threat as a bioweapon because it is highly contagious and in most countries immunization programmes have ceased , resulting in a large pool of unprotected people .","serious side effects with the existing smallpox vaccine ( dryvax ; wyeth ) , and the threat of new virulent forms of smallpox , mean that there is still a need for new , safer versions of the vaccine ."
"the world health organization estimated that more than , 400 people were infected with sars in countries , which killed an estimated people . although not nearly on the same scale as the influenza pandemics of / 19 and , sars remains a menace to global public health , especially if it turns out to be a seasonal disease .","the recent outbreak of sars reminded us that new virulent viruses can suddenly emerge at anytime , and spread rapidly around the globe ."
"to this end , a large number of public and private initiatives are underway to develop a sars vaccine ( for example , the national institutes of health , merck , genvec and avant immunotherapeutics are active in this area ) , although even the most optimistic estimates are that such a vaccine is still at least five years away .",the threat remains and as such there is still a great need for a sars vaccine to prevent further loss of life on a potentially larger scale .
"so , the hope is that the development of an effective hiv vaccine could help to ease this economic burden .","in addition , these drugs exert a heavy financial toll , which developing countries are often unable to bear ."
"an example of this is the recent failure of the gp120 subunit vaccine aidsvax b / b ( vaxgen ) , the most advanced hiv vaccine in development .","unfortunately , hiv , like malaria and tuberculosis , is turning out to be very tricky to develop effective vaccines against , because of the high degree of antigenic variability that exists among hiv strains ."

"comparison of the complete genome sequences ( 27.6 kb ) of isolates p20c22 and p36c12 ( from passages and , respectively ) revealed that p36c12 contains three amino acid substitutions , two in the - kda protein ( encoded by gene ) and one in the s protein , in addition to the frameshifting b product .","immunofluorescent studies revealed that the normal b protein was localized to the nucleus and the truncated product showed a "" free "" distribution pattern , indicating that the c - terminal portion of b was responsible for its nuclear localization ."
"about % of the genome at the - end comprises two overlapping replicase genes , eressing from the genomic rna or mrna in the form of polyproteins a and a / b .","the polyproteins are subsequently processed into at least nonstructural proteins by virusencoded proteinases ( lim et al . , ; ng et al . , ; xu et al . , ) ."

"some of these accessory genes might be related to host specificity , cell tropism , and pathogenesis ( herrewegh et al . , ; wesley et al . , ; de haan et al . , ) .","however , in most cases , the effects of these gene products on animal hosts and the reasons that these orfs have been maintained throughout evolution are yet to be understood ."
"this was due to a single base insertion at the - terminal portion of the b gene , leading to frameshift and a product with only homogeneous amino acid residues .",here we present a report of isolation of an ibv strain with an abnormal b gene encoding a c - terminally truncated product .
"overlapping peaks at the same position , representing different populations of viral rnas , would be observed if wild - type and mutant viruses coexisted .",the sequence profiles of rt - pcr products would represent the populations of the viral rnas presented in a given passage .
"b , the titers of p36c12 at and h postinoculation were higher than those of p20c22 .","afterwards , the titers of p36c12 dropped more quickly than those of p20c22 ."
"after characterization of the growth ability of the two isolates , we decided to determine the complete sequences of p20c22 , p36c12 , and ep3 to see whether any other mutations occurred that could contribute to the phenotype .",the mutations that cause amino acid changes are listed in table fig .
"in vitro transcription was carried out using t7 rna polymerase and the yields of transcripts were quantified so that equal mole of rnas from the paired plasmids , pibv3abc / pibv3abc and pibv3bc / pibv3bc ,",a ) containing either wild - type b ( 3 abc and bc ) or the mutated b ( 3 abc and bc ) were constructed .
"the c protein was immunoprecipitated with anti - e serum , and anti - - tubulin antibody was used in immunoprecipitation as loading controls .","as can be seen , similar levels of the c eression were observed when the abc construct was compared to the abc construct ( fig ."
"for this purpose , a t7 - tag ( encoding amino acids ) sequence was added in frame to the - end of each of the b , b , and b genes under the control of a t7 promotor .","the normal b protein , mutant b ( c - terminal - truncated ) protein , and an n - terminal truncated b protein were transiently eressed in cells and their subcellular localization patterns were analyzed ."
little progress has been made since then on the functions of these nonstructural proteins in the life cycle of ibv .,"we have previously reported that the a , b , a , and b proteins of ibv , encoded by sgrnas and , respectively , were eressed in virus - infected cells but were not assembled into virions ( liu et al . , a ; liu and inglis , b , a , b ."
"interestingly , the mutant emerged and dominated quickly after the prototype strain , ep3 , was adapted from the chicken embryo to a monkey kidney cell line .",the mutant p36c12 has growth advantage over p20c22 with the normal b gene in both vero cells and chicken embryos and has larger plaque sizes than p20c22 .
"however , it was noted that sequencing of the equivalent region of dominant strains from passages and showed that the predicted residue was an ile at this position instead of a met , suggesting that the strain with the i - m mutation did not dominate in the populations .","in addition to the single a insertion in the b gene , an i - m substitution in the s2 region was also observed ."
"as the insertion of an extra a would increase the local at content , we do not rule out the possibility that this insertion may actually enhance the eression of the e protein in the embryonated eggs .","on the other hand , it was observed that p36c12 overgrew p20c22 and was more virulent in chicken embryos than p20c22 ."
then the viruses were adapted to grow in vero cells for passages .,"plaque assays were performed as previously described ( shen et al . , ) ."
"primers l52 , l53 , and l55 were designed to contain an ncoi site ( underlined ) flanked with an ibv - specific sequence ( 20 to nucleotides ) , whereas x7 was complementary to the ibv sequence from nucleotides - 24803 with a bamhi site at .",all plasmids described above contain part of the m gene at the - end as well as other gene ( s ) at the - end of sgrna as indicated in fig .

"the two plasmids contain the s gene and cover the ibv sequence from nucleotides - 24027 , amplified from viral rna of p20c22 and p36c12 , respectively .",the primers x9 ( gttactggatc - cagatgttg ) and xhy12 ( aagttggatccagtcta - gactg tgcc ) used contain an ibv - specific sequence and bamhi site ( underlined ) .
in vitro transcription and translation were carried out separately to assess the quantity of transcripts and efficiency of translation of each gene in each construct .,"transcription and translation in vitro were performed using t7 rna polymerase and wheat germ lysates ( promega ) as previously described ( shen et al . , ) ."
"the mixture was electroporated ( easyject , equibio ) at v in a - cm cuvette ( bio - rad ) .",the cells ( 0.3 ml ) were mixed with g of plasmid .
"the death of the infected embryos was confirmed by examining the embryos that were curled , dwarfed , bleeding , and without body movement .",the difference in virulence was compared between the isolates p20c22 and p36c12 by inoculating no more than pfu per egg and evaluation of the time needed to cause % of the death of the infected embryos .
"at different time points , cells were fixed in % paraformaldehyde - pbs for min and permeabilized with % triton x - 100 - pbs for min .","after incubation at c for h , cells were transfected with appropriate plasmid dna with a t7 - tag sequence at the - end of the normal or truncated b gene using dotap lipisomal transfection reagent ( roche ) ."
"the conformational analysis shows that pom tends to bind primarily with n1 and n8 at the edge of the active pocket , which causes the conformational change of the pincers structure comprising residue and loop .","whereas , the active pockets of n2 , n9 and n4 are found to be more spacious , which allows pom to enter into the active pockets directly and anchor there firmly ."
"however , the longterm treatments by the currently available nai drugs ( oseltamivir and zanamivir ) triggered out various resistant mu - tants in na .","more recently , the drug peramivir has become attractive for their inhibition to all nine na subtypes and is at least as active as oseltamivir and zanamivir against h5n1 viruses in vitro ."
"here we focus on an inorganic - cluster compound , namely polyometalate ( pom ) , which is composed of early transition metal cations ( usually the d0 species v ( v ) , nb ( v ) , ta ( v ) , mo ( vi ) , and w ( vi ) ) and oxygen anions .","there is no appropriate drug with high efficiency and permanent activity in clinical therapy of influenza , especially in combating with the tremendous threat from the forthcoming influenza pandemic ."
"it shows potent bioactivity with high efficiency and low toxicity , and is considered to be a broadspectrum antiviral agent , especially for that containing titanium as a heterometal ion ) , which was once specified as an anti - hiv drug in france and canceled later for its negatively side effects .","it was reported that pm - 19 potentiated azt against hiv - 1 in vitro , but did not potentiate cytotoxicity against mt - 4 cells , and its anti - hiv - 1 index reached up to , the same as that of dextran sulfate ."
which isomer of pom had the favorite inhibitory activity was specified according to their binding free energies to na .,the different induced - fit binding processes of pom to the five subtypes of na were discussed by using flexible docking and md studies .
"the flexible docking and md simulation studies were carried out by using the module affinity and discover in insight ii software package ( accelrys inc . , san diego , ca ) , respectively .","finally , the stability of pom / na complex in aqueous solution was elored by using md simulation study ."
"the veil of the three dimensional structure of na has been almost disclosed , which bestows us the opportunity to investigate the interactions of na and their substrates or inhibitors at the molecular level , as well as the precondition of structure - based drug design .",many single crystals of na have been specified due to the development of the crystallographic study of na .
the strategies to realize the rigid docking of pom are stated as follows .,they intended to develop a protocol for simulating the interaction of pom and the protein .
additional docking parameters were retained as their default values except the parameter runs value was changed to .,"as one configuration was solely generated in each run , optimal configurations would be generated at last ."
it has been demonstrated that incorporating protein structural flexibility is significant for both binding mode predictions and ligand generation .,"in order to investigate whether the binding process of pom to n1 could be better described by induced - fit theory , we used the module affinity to implement a flexible docking study on the configuration which had the highest score in the rigid docking ."
"the result shows that the five subtypes of na can be divided into two groups , with n1 , n4 and n8 affiliated to group , and n2 and n9 to group .","on the basis of the alignment results , the three dimensional structures of the five subtypes of na were superimposed ( figure ) ."
"the left panel shows the favorite primary binding sites of the isomer , 2 on the surface of na , with na rendering ribbon style and pom rendering ball - and - stick style .","the right panel indicates the pincers structure , which controls the entry of pom into the active pocket of na , with the residues comprising the pincers rendering ball - and - stick style and pom rendering cpk style ."
the differences of residue in the five subtypes of na are shown in figure .,"in group , n4 has slightly different features that the phenol side chain rotated out of the pocket almost compared with n1 and n8 ."
"the positively charged residues , such as arg430 , arg118 , arg371 and arg292 , approached pom and formed hydrogen bond and salt bridge interactions with negatively charged pom ( figure ( a ) ) .","the electrostatic interactions are shown to be the driving force during the process of the formation of pom / na complex , which is consistent with the following comparison of the electrostatic potential maps of na before and after the flexible docking ."
thus the access of pom into the active pocket is permitted .,"simultaneously , the positively charged residues , such as arg371 , arg118 and arg152 , approached negatively charged pom ."
"for n2 , n9 and n4 , whose active pockets are found to be more spacious , pom could enter their pocket directly and the residues in the active pocket gradually adopted a more appropriate conformation and orientation to accommodate in summary , pom took an induced - fit process to enter the active pockets of various subtypes of na in different ways .",electrostatic interactions were found to be the driving force during the binding procedure .
the rmsd values of the configurations of the five na subtypes are plotted in figure s1 .,"the highest scored configurations of the five complexes , pom / n1 , pom / n2 , pom / n4 , pom / n8 , and pom / n9 , were subjected to ns md simulation ."
"finally , the binding energies of the equilibrium conformations were evaluated in autodock3 . 0.5 .",the binding energies and the corresponding inhibitory constants are listed in table .
it is consistent with the eerimental results by zhang et al .,that the binding of pom to proteins may cause the protein molecule to take an unfolding process .
"demodification reactions with [ p ] - adp - ribosylated parp10 were carried out by varying the studied parameter , followed by separation on polyacrylamide gels and quantifying the residual [ p ] - parp10 signal on autoradiographs .","( b - f ) parp10 demodification reaction by macrod2 was tested for dependence on ( b ) adpr product inhibition , line represents a theoretical fit for inhibition ; ( c ) temperature ; ( d ) macrod2 enzyme concentration ; ( e ) ph ; ( f ) incubation time , lines represent a theoretical fit for single turnover kinetics ."
the system was heated to k employing positional restraints on the solute atoms followed by a stepwise relaxation of the positional restraints .,the complex was solvated in an octahedral box using the tip3p water model and neutralized by adding sodium and chloride ions .
"the samples were separated on nupage gels , gels were dried and eed to imaging plates ( fuji film ) .",the reactions were stopped by gel loading buffer and heating at c .
the macrodomains were added either before nad + addition or after the parp1 reaction had proceeded for minutes .,"in vitro activity modulation was checked by performing parp1 de - modification reactions for a total of minutes ( see above ) , with the exception that m macrod2 or macroh2a . 1.1 were present during the reaction ."
"to generate adp - ribosylated peptide on lysine residue , m peptide ( papaksapapkkgskk - biotin ) was incubated with mm adp - ribose derived from nad and [ p ] - nad hydrolysis in mm tris ph at c for > 7 days .","the m peptide was then incubated with either m koh , buffer"
the damage of the cake / gel layer resulted in the decrease of phage removal .,"for the 2 mm module , the cake layer , the gel layer and the membrane contributed log , log and log , respectively to phage removal , confirming the importance of the cake / gel layer formed on the surface of membrane ."
"however , this wastewater has long been treated with the conventional wastewater treatment processes .","even in well - functioning biological plants , as many as cfu ml resistant coliform bacteria were found in its effluent , to say nothing of much smaller viruses ."
"as for other disinfection methods , such as chlorination , chlorine dioxide , ozone and uv radiation etc . , the mutagenic / carcinogenic and toxic disinfection by - products , which are potentially harmful to humans and aquatic organisms , are often accompanied with the disinfection treatment .","moreover , the presence of suspended solids and organic compounds in wastewater often lower disinfection efficiency drastically ."
some of above characteristics make smbr have a potential ability to remove virus more effectively and safely .,"smbr , which is characterized by its ability of complete suspended solids removal from effluent , low / zero sludge production , compact size and lower energy consumption , has gained more and more attention ."
"based on above eeriments , the feasibility of smbr to remove sars coronavirus was evaluated .","in this study , a smbr for treatment of virus - bearing wastewater was investigated using phage t4 as a tracer focusing on : the removal efficiency of well - running sbmr to virus that suddenly surged into wastewater ; the effects of pore size of membrane modules on viral removal performance ; the effects of cake / gel layer disintegration on rival removal efficiency ; and the mechanisms of viral removal by smbr equipped with different membrane modules ."
the membrane flux was driven by the difference of water head between the liquid level in the bioreactor and the effluent pipe ( 8.5 kpa ) .,two different membrane modules ( pore size of 2 mm and mm ) were mounted in each membrane compartment .
t4 stock solution ( 10 pfu ml ) was prepared in advance and it was added to wastewater to make the phage concentration in a range from to pfu ml .,phage t4 was selected as a model virus in this study because : its size is similar to that of the sars coronavirus ; it is harmless to humans ; it can be seeded with a high concentration in tracer eeriments ; and the assay method is relatively easy and simple .
"for phage assay , samples were taken from the influent tank and outlet of each module at the same time everyday .",phage concentration was assayed according to the double - layer - agar method described by adams with e . coli b as host bacteria .
"moreover , microorganisms in activated sludge did not interfere with the enumeration of the phage plaque because views were finished before they could grow obviously .",results of the preliminary eeriments have demonstrated that the phage concentration in the influent tank was kept constant for at least h after seeding .
the following equation can be used to describe the overall characteristics of membrane fouling :,"in all practical membrane filtration applications , as the resistance increases the flux will decline ."
"but , as time past , this value decreased gradually and stabilized at - 0.3 log till day .",it was inferred that cake layer formed on the membrane surface further reduced the effective pore size .
"c , stages a and b ) . this phenomenon implied that by selecting a membrane with a mean pore size slightly smaller than that of the target virus , complete viral removal could be eected in the well - running smbr .","in comparison , as for mm membrane , t4 was not detectable in the effluent from the beginning to day ( fig ."
"if cake / gel layer was decomposed by any factors , - 4.1 log of phage would permeate to effluent .","for the mm module , on the other hand , membrane alone could block most phages from leaking by direct membrane interception ."
"for the mm membrane , direct interception by membrane played a key role for t4 removal .","for the 2 mm membrane , on the other hand , the cake / gel layer formed on the membrane played an important role ."
"by measuring the phage concentration of mixed liquor rather than supernatant of bulk solution , we demonstrated that there was no phage accumulation occurred in bulk solution .","so far , limited information was reported on the accumulation of phage in bulk solution ."
"in order to preclude any virus leakage , the membrane module , with a pore size slightly smaller than diameter of the target virus , would be a safe option .","in conclusion , data in this study showed that the wellrunning smbr had a good ability to intercept / inactivate the virus that surged suddenly into municipal wastewater ."
"in this article , we have chosen to use the relatively neutral , but also vague , definition by putman .",an ecological community is thus defined as ' ' a group of species that interact in a given geographical area and whose functions and dynamics are somehow interdependent ' ' .
the literature in this domain is teeming with scientific evidences that describe the parasitic pressures on natural host populations .,the first ' ' visible ' ' effect exerted by parasites is the more or less important regulation that virulent infections can have on the size of host populations in wildlife .
"indeed , if a parasite species can simultaneously attack many host species , the ones that are more tolerant to the parasite ( i . e . , the host species that can support the reproduction of the parasite while sustaining little damage ) will engender an ' ' apparent ' ' competition with the less tolerant host species that will pay for the cost of the parasite virulence .","in the case of a generalist parasite that can thus infect a significant range of host species , the consequences are generally destabilizing for the host communities ."
"indeed , by limiting the abundance of the species they infect , these host - specialized parasites also decrease the local competition pressure among host species and allow the rarest species to freely coexist in the environment .","on the other hand , the effects of host - specialized parasites on host species communities are the opposite of the ones previously described , because generally an important diversity in host species is maintained locally ."
"to sum up , parasites can influence the structure of species communities and the consequences of this on the ecosystems can be contrasting due to the leverage action they exert on the coexistence of host species within local communities .","moreover , within natural ecosystems , parasites are undeniably key elements that contribute to the shaping of the observed variety of local species communities ."
"one or more host species can either disappear or appear locally , and this in turn can have important repercussions on the dynamics of parasite transmission .",asking about the role played by a community of hosts on the dissemination of a parasite boils down to consider the influence that a local change in the host species composition can have on its transmission .
"the introduction of individuals of a host species ( here symbolized by a pheasant ) , which is tolerant to the parasite ( here a heterakis nematode worm ) , leads to an increase of the parasite prevalence within the community .","if this tolerant host species interacts with another host species , which is less or nontolerant ( here partridges ) , the increase in the disease prevalence will then cause extra mortality in the non - or less tolerant host species , independently from the type of interactions between tolerant and nontolerant host species ."
these two highly susceptible reservoir individuals will infect in turn two new vector individuals .,"in the left panel , an infected vector transmits the pathogen to two individuals from a susceptible reservoir species ."
"the second host species therefore served only to dilute the transmission process , but in general , it is difficult to separate a dilution effect due to greater host species richness or composition .","in the case of louping ill virus , which is transmitted in red grouse by the vector tick species ies ricinus , begon concluded that in the presence of a second , less competent host species , a transmission event linked infectious individuals with incompetent susceptible host individuals that generated many fewer new infections than a competent host would have ."
"has proposed a more general theoretical formalism by borrowing empirical observations derived from community ecology to mimic the relationships observed in nature between local species richness and relative abundance in species ( see section , i . e . , species richness - abundance curves ) .",this study concentrated on the intensity of transmission of a pathogen in a local community of host species by studying the observed maximum prevalence of locally infected cases that represents a close estimate of the r .
"by taking into account that , in the case of vector - borne zoonotic diseases , two categories of animal communities interact , on one side , the reservoir species and , on the other side , the insect species , this study allowed highlighting the following findings .","for two local communities with the same reservoir species richness and abundance but with different species compositions , an increase in the variation of the reservoir species susceptibility corresponded to a greater number of reservoir species with lower level of susceptibility ."
"for zoonotic vector - borne infections , there are two types of contacts : ( i ) between infectious vectors and more or less susceptible reservoir hosts and ( ii ) between infectious host reservoirs and more or less susceptible vectors .","indeed , the dilution effect requires that vector contacts must be wasted on poorly competent reservoirs , but also that vector species richness , by increasing their abundance , cannot compensate for these wasted contacts to overcome the dilution effect ."
"that , while an increase in the number of reservoir host species generally dilutes the transmission of a pathogen , a local increase in vector species richness amplifies transmission ( fig .",it is interesting to note from the multi - host dynamic model by roche et al .
"west nile virus is a flavivirus commonly found in africa , west asia , middle east , eastern europe , northern and central america and west indies that causes encephalitis ( inflammation of brain and spinal chord ) in humans and horses .","west nile disease is transmitted by different mosquito vectors , which bite and infect birds ."
"conversely , in the usa , where there are a multitude of bird reservoir species ( of which a large part appears to be very susceptible ) and an important diversity in vector species ( some vectors being highly competent ) , huge epidemics that have propagated to the entire country , from east to west , in only a few years have been reported .","in southern europe , like in the camargue area , where the bird reservoir species are poorly to moderately susceptible to infection and only two vector species , one being moderately and the other one poorly susceptible , are present , the prevalence of west nile virus is highly sporadic ."
"bearing in mind that , generally , pathogen dynamics are driven by the dynamics of the overall biological diversity of the community and not of one single reservoir or vector host species , then future research should concentrate on revisiting the idea of disease transmission using a broader community - scale perspective than the one generally applied .",", the combination ( s ) of local reservoir and vector species richness and composition that can either amplify or dilute the infection may help to elain many other ( new ) emerging disease spillovers ."
"for some pathogens , like for instance west nile virus , different species of reservoirs ( birds ) and vectors can be involved locally , and changes in both reservoir and vector diversity from place to place can result in functional changes in transmission that have strong effects on the disease dynamics .","indeed , animal viruses with multiple hosts are more likely to be designated as emerging threats than the ones with single hosts , a finding that emphasizes the importance of better examining the role played by host and vector diversity ."
"undoubtedly , it is realistic to acknowledge that the local and regional heterogeneity in vector and reservoir diversity can more or less affect disease behaviour and spread in nonspecialized parasites .","overall , the evidence that the local host diversity influences the outcomes of disease dynamics seems clear for both lyme disease and west nile virus ."
"it is clear from this review that to better understand multi - species dynamics of diseases , we should rather collect qualitative information on the largest possible number of actors in disease dynamics than to obtain quantitative and substantial data but only for one or two reservoir hosts or vectors that are a priori suspected to be involved in the transmission .","given the recent emergence of important infectious diseases in several complex communities , more attention should be given to generalist pathogens and to recording the number and identity of all potential vector and reservoir species locally , instead of focusing only on the more competent , well - accepted hosts and vectors ."
"besides , it comes back also to better understand the links that exist between the relative competence of reservoir and vector species and their life - history strategies , particularly the fact that competent hosts and vectors are often ubiquitous and generalist organisms .","other lifehistory characteristics of reservoir and vector species should be further elored , such as reproductive strategies , feeding habits or body features , for instance ."
"on the other hand , there is no clear evidence that the pathogen prevalence for vector - borne infections is lower in richer reservoir communities .","indeed , by studying the transmission of a generalist plant virus in eerimentally manipulated plant communities , power and mitchell showed that the pathogen prevalence was entirely driven by the single , most competent plant species ."
"limited so far by a too simplistic perspective ( the triad ' ' one agent - one vector - one reservoir ' ' ) on the complexity of natural communities , its development in the next years should stem from a partnership between specialists of complex systems , especially those working on multi - agent systems , ecologists , evolutionary biologists and epidemiologists .","we conclude this review with an idea that has been pervasive throughout this essay : different epidemiological and ecological outcomes for a same disease can occur in different places , and one important and probably missing ingredient in the understanding of emerging infectious disease is the role of biological diversity and its heterogeneity in space and time ."
"similarly , immunosuppression of mice with cyclophosphamide prior to infection resulted in a marked reduction of mononuclear infiltrates and myelin destruction in the cns compared with non - immunosuppressed mice , though both groups of mice showed comparable virus and serum neutralising antibody titres ( townsend and baringer , ; altmann and blyth , ) .","these studies suggest that the immune response triggered during hsv - 1 infection and the resultant infiltration of immune cells into the cns can , under certain circumstances , cause as much damage as the virus itself ."
"in this study , therefore , we have used cell type - specific markers which would allow unambiguous identification of the different types of neural or immune cells in the brain .","the questions we have addressed here are whether myelin loss is related to the type and proportion of neural cells infected with hsv , what cells infiltrate into the brain during infection and how do they relate spatially to infected cells or areas of myelin loss ."
"for histological examination , sections were fixed in calcium formalin and absolute alcohol before being stained with solochrome cyanin , washed with % ammonium ferric sulphate and counter - stained with eosin .","compound ( miles scientific , u . s . a . ) and horizontal cryostat sections / zm thick were made ."
"it is , however , hkely that this may be mediated via lymphokines .",the precise role of these cells in the pathology of hsv - l - induced encephalitis is at present unclear .
"this resulted in the development of a transparent , best - practices system of science that assured the potential of recombinant dna research could be achieved in a safe manner , and remains a model for regulation of science by scientists .","in the united states , the first iteration of the recombinant dna research guidelines ( national institutes of health ( nih ) guidelines ) were drafted with public input in by a national institutes of health federal advisory committee that eventually became known as the recombinant dna advisory committee ( rac ) ( see also chapter ) ."
"with regard to the most dangerous pathogens and toxins known as biological select agents and toxins ( bsat ) , these acts mandated their registration , criminal background checks for users , a regulatory system for storage and transportation , and the creation of a class of "" restricted persons , "" who were prohibited from their access ( see also chapter ) .","because implementation of this legislation could have the unintended consequence of making the united states more vulnerable to bioterrorism by slowing or blocking the development of the very diagnostics , prophylactics and therapeutics that are needed to protect the country from bioterrorism , the national research council of the national academies of sciences formed the committee on research standards and practices to prevent the destructive applications of biotechnology ."
"of its seven recommendations , recommendations , , , and were pertinent to the ibc .",the nrc report recommendations concerning dual - use research ( dur ) with the most dangerous pathogens and toxins would be implemented by self - governance of the scientific community and existing regulatory practice .
"in addition to proposing a detailed process for evaluation of dur at the institutional level through an institutional review entity ( ire ) , the report emphasized the importance of mandatory education and training of all life scientists at federally funded institutions , a code of conduct for scientists and laboratory personnel working in the life sciences and aligned fields , and public involvement in the dur debate .","importantly , the nsabb report reiterated a concern of the nrc report that oversight of dur should not become another unfunded mandate ."
"current usg policy appears to diminish the role of the ibc in the oversight of durc , whereas we believe the local ibcs should assume yet even more responsibility .",we detail our judgments on current usg dur policy and provide recommendations for future oversight of dur from our perspective as senior administrators and laboratory scientists charged with the responsibility of conducting life - sciences research in an era of increasing regulatory requirements and decreasing federal support .
"in addition to bsat research in high - containment bsl - 3 / bsl - 4 laboratories , many other potential sources of durc may arise from scientists working in low - containment bsl - 1 or bsl - 2 laboratories or amateur biologists eerimenting in their garages .",the usg policies with regard to durc are far too limited .
"at the time this research was published it received little attention , underscoring how difficult it is to recognize dur , and emphasizing the need for a comprehensive and mandatory education program for dur and relevant policies as called for in the nsabb report .","this is an example of dur that arguably meets the definition of durc as it provides a "" road - map "" for the construction of a recombinant virus based on existing knowledge and techniques that could infect and transmit efficiently in human populations resulting in sterility ."
"publication of this study in stimulated an intense debate in the popular and scientific press as the research provided a potential second "" road - map "" for construction of a similarly "" vaccine - proof "" variola virus .",an unintended consequence of eression of the il - 4 gene was the induction of a profound immunosuppression in the infected mouse that resulted in lethal infections of a resistant mouse strain and mice normally protected by vaccine immunity .
this study would be elicitly covered by the durc policy .,"on the other hand , kawaoka and colleagues at the university of madison used receptor - binding studies and animal eeriments to identify four mutational changes to the same h protein when eressed in a virus containing the remaining seven gene segments from a pandemic influenza a / h1n1 virus ."
"it was to be completed before october , , the - year anniversary of the initiation of the funding pause .","the funding pause also allowed for a future eansion of the scope of regulated research possibly to other pathogens suggesting further eansion of the "" list "" ."
"it calls for review of life sciences research involving durc for only a small number of agents ( 15 bsat ) , but its reliance on a prescriptive list of pathogens can contribute to a failure to review projects with similar durc potential , but utilizing dissimilar approaches ( e . g . , fouchier versus kawaoka studies ) .","equally important , the durc policy fails to address the need to review the vast majority of life sciences research for durc as proposed by the nsabb report ( see also chapter ) ."
"the nih guidelines recognized that certain studies with influenza virus , such as those involving influenza a / h5n1 virus , involved increased risk to personnel and the public , and therefore required increased engineering controls , enhanced ppe , and additional practices , but not additional review .","the ibc alone reviews and approves the majority of registration documents , including those involving durc ."
"in addition to the engineering controls , personnel protective equipment and practices , a robust occupational health program was in place at both institutions .","for example , the kawaoka ferret transmission eeriments were carried out at bsl - 3 ag , which differs from absl - 4 only in the lack of an automatic chemical decontamination exit shower , and the use of respiratory protection based on external hepa filtered air - supply rather than the powered air purifying respiratory ( papr ) system used in bsl - 3 enhanced , absl - 3 enhanced , or bsl - 3 ag laboratories ."
"for this reason , it is worthwhile to examine more closely the scientific question that the research was designed to answer , and the basis of the controversy .","from the duration and intensity of the discussions concerning these two studies in the popular and scientific press , it is clear that some felt the ibc review to be inadequate ."
"since there have been laboratory - confirmed clinical infections of influenza a / h5n1 virus and fatalities , but there has been no documented , sustained human - to - human transmission .","in , a blue ribbon panel on influenza research recommended to the niaid that : evolutionary pressures that lead to emergence and spread of new viral subtypes - especially the factors that favor transmission from animals to humans - are urgent research priorities ."
"the debate on the pros and cons of the fouchier and kawaoka studies continued unabated with the main issues concerning the risk and benefit of the research to the public , the need for an enhanced evaluation and public discussion of a small percentage of durc , and whether public dissemination of the identity of the genetic mutations enhancing transmissibility had biosecurity implications .","the nsabb recommended changes , and revised manuscripts were subsequently published in followed by a voluntary moratorium on new gain - of - function research with influenza a / h5n1 virus ."
since the influenza a / h5n1 gain - of - function controversy there have been several publications estimating the potential public health risks associated with the study of the genetic basis of influenza a / h5n1 virus transmissibility in mammalian species .,"the majority of these studies based their risk estimates on data from the same publication by henkel and colleagues , which was the first report to describe the results of the national bsat theft , loss or release reporting system for the years between and that focused on biosafety or biocontainment lapses ; however , as we shall see , this study lacked the necessary background information required for use of the data in robust risk analyses ."
"the report documented laboratory - acquired infections ( lai ) of which seven and four occurred in bsl - 2 and bsl - 3 containment laboratories , respectively .",this and other studies concluded that the majority of lai were acquired through unrecognized aerosol eure :
these observations are entirely consistent with studies by pike who found no distinguishable accidents or eure events in more than % of lais .,harding and byers also reported only a small number of recognized containment breaks in a study of lais .
"similarly , the henkel publication provided the number of individuals working in all of the reporting bsl - 2 , bsl - 3 , and bsl - 4 containment laboratories , but did not attribute an individual number to each biosafety level .","and , finally , influenza a / h5n1 virus eeriments are carried out at bsl - 3 enhanced , which contain a number of additional safety features over bsl - 3 that would minimize the frequency of eures and the probability of a lai ."
"similarly , the probability that a community lai would lead to a pandemic , and the estimated magnitude of the pandemic were equally dependent on assumptions .",the - fold difference between the two values was due to the authors ' application of various assumptions to the calculation : some included the impact of specific practices on reducing the likelihood of a lai ; others involved differing estimations of the number of labs involved in the research ; and still others assumed differences in the probabilities of lai in bsl - 3 laboratories using viruses versus bacteria .
"further , the ibcs evaluated the fouchier and kawaoka studies prior to publication of the henkel report .","thus , even these limited data may not have been available for risk - benefit analyses , and to inform decisions on whether additional biosafety or biosecurity measures were necessary and would be meaningful ."
"in order to continue to improve best practices for biocontainment and biosecurity , it is especially important to have accidental eure data ( or the lack thereof ) from the new state - of - the - art bsl - 3 / 4 national biodefense analysis and countermeasures center and integrated research facility at frederick , md , and from similar facilities in other countries .","the lack of stratified eure and lai data could be mitigated to some degree , if reports describing high - containment biosafety laboratory eure data described the detailed biocontainment context ( e . g . , detailed descriptions of engineering controls , personnel protective equipment , and practices ) in which individuals worked , were inadvertently eed to an agent , and at a low frequency became infected ."
"also , the cloning of a toxin molecule with ld of less than ng / kg requires ibc and nih / office of biotechnology activities ( nih / oba ) approval ( nih guidelines , section iii - b ) .","for example , the deliberate transfer of a drug resistance trait to a certain microorganism could require ibc review , rac review , and nih director approval prior to initiation of the study ( nih guidelines , section iii - a ) ."
"the current durc policy calls for the evaluation of dur involving the bsat at the level of the institutional review entity ( ire ) , which most often will be the ibc ( for detailed discussion of the mechanics of durc review see also chapter ) .",the ire uses a risk - benefit assessment analysis to determine whether proposed research is durc .
this would make sense as otherwise the dhhs review committee would have to generate de novo the risk - benefit analysis and the risk management plan for each project it reviewed .,"would the funding agencies require an ibc reviewed registration document , including a risk - benefit analysis and risk mitigation plan , to accompany the funding solicitation ?"
"identified durc would be managed by a risk mitigation plan developed by the ibc and pi , with no additional level of review described .",durc would be identified by risk - benefit analysis using a suite of tools described by the nsabb .
"the reaction to the influenza a / h5n1 controversy has been an inadvertent reduction of the ibc role in the management of this class of eeriment , the addition of more oversight to the review process , and the potential for eansion of the "" list "" with the addition of more pathogens and more classes of durc ( 2014 funding pause ) .","prior to , the ibc had the major role in the evaluation of influenza a / h5n1 , sars - cov , and mers - cov gain - of - function research proposals for biosafety and biosecurity based solely on the nih guidelines ."
our view is that ibc review of durc should be eanded even further than mandated by the durc policy to include all of life sciences research .,"although this would further increase the workload of the ibc , it would result in a more comprehensive picture of durc in life sciences research , especially research carried out in laboratories that have low to no biosafety containment and biosecurity ."
a series of usa today articles have suggested that not all of the nation ' s biocontainment laboratories are being operated in a safe and secure manner .,"the ibc is well suited to elain to local communities the review process , including the risk - benefit assessment that is a component in the evaluation of durc ."
"the technology permits modification of dna of humans , other animals , and plants such that transcriptional regulation can be altered or genes added or subtracted .","importantly , compared to previous techniques for modifying dna , this new approach is much faster and easier , and promises to change the manner in which certain diseases are treated ."
"as compared to the institutional animal care and use committee and the institutional review board , the ibc receives a fraction of the resources , has equal or greater regulatory burden , and is responsible for a broader swath of science .","the usg needs to determine a mechanism to directly fund the ibc without leaving this task to the institution ( see section , "" regulatory compliance for research institutions : an unfunded mandate "" ) ."
"this could be difficult for some smaller institutions , and it would be important to have an eanded availability of commercial , virtual ibcs and / or a national register of trained ad hoc ibc members .","equally important , the pis and members of the ibc must receive education and training on dur , especially risk - benefit analyses ."
the office of biotechnology activities in the office scientific policy at nih sponsors a comprehensive website that provides education materials on dur .,"this report described a comprehensive educational outreach strategy targeting multiple target audiences ( e . g . , congress , general public , scientists , laboratory staff , students / trainees , research administrators , and institutional leadership ) through multiple venues ( e . g . , professional associations , scientific societies , scientific journals , opinion leaders , and the popular press ) ."
"the majority of ibc members , pis , and laboratory staff have not received training on dur .",there is a low level of interest and knowledge of the dual - use dilemma shown by senior scientists and institutional officials .
a national academy of sciences report found pis spent almost half of the time assigned for federally funded projects on meeting the requirements imposed by those projects .,as many as separate administrative activities - both pre - and post - award - were identified .
"despite uncertainty regarding the current structure and dissemination of the guidelines and regulations , the survey showed that scientists were overwhelmingly in favor of continued regulation .",of particular interest was the observation that many researchers were more concerned about committing a violation than they were about personal injury .
"while the authors recognized a number of problems with the analysis ( so that the numbers may be "" soft "" ) , the data clearly indicated that there was a - 5 - fold decrease in certain bsat research , as estimated by the number of bsat research papers published in the united states .","thus , bsat research activity dropped by %, while general pathogen research dropped by only %."
"morse points out that "" many of the proposed negative impacts of the [ se ] regulations are based on anecdotal evidence . ""","for example , a number of microbial collections were destroyed by investigators when the bsat regulations came into effect , and the bsat program tried to prevent further losses by moving culture collections to registered laboratories ."
"the data were mixed : incident training and incident reporting remained problematic , as were interactions with other regulatory committees ( institutional animal care and use committees ( iacuc ) and institutional review boards ( irb ) ) , while improvements in management , staffing , and compliance improved over the years covered by the surveys .","a recent report reviewed trends in ibc practices by evaluating responses to surveys of ibcs registered with the cdc from , , and ."
how can we factor in the impacts of research policies on research quality and productivity ?,"how can we find a "" healthy balance between facilitating research and protecting against audit and legal concerns ?"
"instead , the issue is whether institutional resources are adequate to ensure the safe and secure conduct of durc , especially at a time when many research institutions face increasing financial stress related to the conduct of research .","while those stresses are a function of several trends that apply generally to federal funding , they have clear implications for durc : ( i ) decreasing levels of funding for biomedical research over the past decade , in actual dollars and as a percentage of the federal budget , and ( ii ) an inerable increase in federal regulations since , the year when the current cap on administrative costs on federal awards was established , that exacts a cumulative financial burden for regulatory compliance ."
"that funding also has occasioned growth in the biosciences : nih funding in supported over , 000 researchers at over universities and research institutions , reflecting the critical role of nih funding for the biomedical science community .","federal funding for biotechnology research has long been critical to scientific advances that , in turn , have contributed to improved public health and to a growing economy ."
"as a consequence of the increasing applications for a decreasing pool of funds , success rates for nih awards also have declined over that period , from this increase in institutional research costs is reflected in fy2010 data collected by the national science foundation through their annual higher education research and development ( herd ) survey , which shows that institutional funds directly supporting research totaled $9.1 billion .","when combined with institutional support for associated "" indirect "" ( i . e . , facilities and administrative ) eenses , institutional funding in accounted for % of all research & development eenditures , compared to % of r & d eenditures in ."
"the impetus for the federal government to set facility and administration ( f & a ) rates , of course , was to support the indirect costs associated with the conduct of federally funded research .","hence , f & a rates are negotiated by institutions that receive federal funding , typically via audits that are undertaken ( at an institution ' s eense ) every years ."
"recently , the council on government relations ( cogr ) compiled a list of regulations that have been implemented or amended between and , as well as interpretations / implementations that have impacted business practices .","while the cap on administrative cost rates is unchanged since , the same cannot be said of the regulatory landscape that contributes to those costs ."
"faced with the ongoing need to comply with these and other regulatory and / or financial reporting requirements , research institutions have developed multiple structures to manage these recurrent functions .","this is reflected to some degree in compliance committees , many involving faculty representation , that include irb , iacuc , ibc , ire , conflict of interest ( coi ) committees , etc ."
the previously referenced herd study estimated that indirect costs incurred by research institutions in fy2010 exceeded federal f & a support by $4.6 billion dollars .,"another survey , undertaken by the association of american medical colleges ( aamc ) , examined indirect costs of medical schools with research programs that received federal funding that ranged from moderate ( $26 million ) to very high ( $751 million ) levels in fy2013 ."
"of course , the costs of compliance are not only measured in dollars nor are they visited only on research institutions .","those costs are visited on investigators , as well , often in the form of reduced research productivity ."
"in fact , the requirements are sufficiently demanding that some research institutions have moved away from durc research because of the costs of continuing such investigations relative to the costs of other forms of biomedical research .","while the latter trend affects all research institutions , it might be argued that it particularly affects those engaged in durc , as the safety and security requirements for that form of research are particularly steep ."
"although the cost shift may be inadvertent , its magnitude is substantial and its long - term effects prejudicial to the health of the us scientific enterprise at a time when the potential for truly significant breakthroughs is at historically high levels .","unfortunately , the effectiveness of the scientific arm of the "" war on terror "" can be undercut by the converging stresses discussed above , which shift increasing costs of research onto research institutions ."
"of the recommended actions , several were aimed at mitigating the regulatory burden described above : ( i ) that federal awards fully fund the direct and indirect costs of research ( recommendation ) , and ( ii ) that the federal government reduce costly regulations that do not substantially improve the research environment ( recommendation ) .","similar themes were echoed in another report that advanced more specific solutions : years , the costs of maintaining that balance have grown and are visited disproportionately on the institutions in which the scientific work occurs ."
"five genera have been etiologically linked with diseases of humans : orthoreovirus , orbivirus , rotavirus , coltivirus , and seadornavirus .",the genome of all reoviridae consists of linear doublestranded rna surrounded by a nonenveloped icosahedral capsid to nm in diameter .
"serologic studies of reovirus prevalence have documented steady increases from infancy ( 5% to % seropositivity at year of age ; % at years of age ; % at years of age ) through adulthood ( 50% at to years of age ; > 80% by years of age ) , , 5 reflecting immunity acquired as a consequence of natural infection .","despite this , it has been difficult to provide convincing evidence linking reoviruses to specific human diseases ."
", both viruses are presumably of bat origin with transmission to humans by bat droppings or contaminated fruits .",", more recently , two new and closely related reoviruses ( melaka and kampar viruses ) have been identified and characterized from six adult and pediatric malaysian patients with acute respiratory tract infection ."
"the term reovirus is an acronym for respiratory enteric orphan virus , which emphasizes the anatomic site from which these viruses were initially isolated .","a long - term study of children with diarrhea implicated reoviruses in only % of cases , and those occurred mainly in infants younger than definition reoviruses are linear double - stranded rna viruses with broad host ranges ."
"asymptomatic infection is common ; symptomatic infection usually consists of mild , self - limited upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal illness .",infection of humans is common but is rarely associated with significant disease .
"acute febrile illness , including fever , headache , and myalgia has been reported , as has one case of encephalitis in a child with convulsions and flaccid paralysis .",seroprevalence studies in that region are as high as % to %.
these reports illustrate the rare but possible neuroinvasive potential of reoviruses in the human host .,"a novel reovirus strain ( serotype ) , mrv2tou05 , was implicated in two cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy in children from the same family ."
"although reovirus - based oncotherapy primarily targets cancer cells through direct killing by apoptosis ( oncolysis ) , additional immunebased mechanisms aiding in tumor elimination have been proposed .",synergistic antitumor effects of reovirus in combination with radiation or chemotherapy have been demonstrated .
"orbiviruses are named based on their characteristic frontotemporal encephalitis , and all four developed uveochorioretinitis .","the genus orbivirus contains more than subspecies classified within serogroups , infecting a broad range of arthropod and vertebrate hosts ."
acute febrile illness due to changuinola virus has been reported in a single human case from panama .,"seroprevalence studies indicate high rates of seropositivity in parts of south america , but the infection - todisease ratio is unknown ."
"content validity , internal consistency , and test - retest reliability of the proposed core competency were ensured .",literature review and the delphi approach were used to draft the core competency items of hospital infection control nurses in hong kong .
"hence , the competency level of icns became the concern of hospital management and clients .",the most prominent change was that more and more icns were deployed .
", however , these publications from overseas standards cannot be employed directly in the local setting because of differences in health care structure , philosophy and management approach , setting and resources , disease epidemiology , and education background .","therefore , we propose a core competency for specialist icns in hong kong ."
"this study was approved by the human subjects ethics subcommittee of the hong kong polytechnic university , hong kong , sar .","last , the reliability was developed based on traditional statistical methods and the rasch model ."
only categories or items on which % or more of the members agreed were included .,", the k statistics were worked out to quantify the quality of the content validity by the online calculator of the university of joensuu , finland ."
"at the end of the questionnaire , the eerts were asked whether all the content domains were included in the draft core competency list .",they were requested to specify the missing content in the case of a negative answer .
"subjects were asked to rate each competency item as very important , important , undecided , not important or not very important .",", , to minimize the memory effect , the sequence of items in each questionnaire was randomly assigned ."
the rasch - andrich thresholds increased monotonically from 7 to 5 showing that the scale was ordered .,"this illustrated that the ex - icns generally agreed with the competency items that were drafted by the field eerts , which matched the validity content ."
"ferrets have been used for hunting and fur production , as pets , and as models in biomedical research .",the domestic or european ferret ( mustela putorius furo ) has been domesticated for thousands of years .
"to date , this model continues to be an important use of the ferret and includes work on pathogenesis , treatment , vaccine development , and investigation of reye ' s syndrome ( maher and destefano ) .","one of the earlier ferret models involved the study of human influenza , a disease to which ferrets are highly susceptible ."
"in addition to the study of respiratory diseases , ferrets have been used as a model for human gastrointestinal disease .","most notable is the ferret model for peptic ulcer disease , which has resulted from the anatomical and physiological similarity of the ferret stomach to the human stomach , and the fact that both species possess a helicobacter gastritis - causing organism ( fox et al ."
a ferret model for evaluating the emetic potential of drugs is another use of the ferret in the field of drug development ( crawford et al .,"in addition to many basic research applications , ferrets have also been investigated as a nonrodent test system in pharmaceutical drug development , especially as a surrogate for dogs when test material is in limited supply ( gad ) ."
"often , however , the only requirement is a healthy ferret within a particular weight range .",it is advantageous to be familiar with ferret biology to facilitate decision making .
"as depicted in figure , growth is rapid , with sexually intact males weighing twice that of females by wk of age .","whether or not age is a study - specific requirement , it is important for the researcher to be familiar with normal ferret growth in order to plan properly for housing needs ."
"however , ear tags and microchips are reliable methods of identification , which can be applied or implanted before shipment .","tattoos and neck collars are largely unsuitable compared with larger laboratory species such as the dog , cat , and rabbit ."
"breeding facilities routinely vaccinate , but if ferrets are purchased before the animals have reached the designated vaccination age , immunizations become the responsibility of the research institution .","unless restricted by the research , it is recommended that ferrets be fully immunized against rabies and canine distemper virus ."
"because the vast majority of ferrets used in research are reared conventionally , histories should include birth dates , sex identification , immunization dates , surgery dates if applicable , and any medications administered before shipment .",it is appropriate to eect the breeding facility to provide a health history for each ferret .
"once selection criteria have been established , arrangements must be made for transportation of the ferrets to the laboratory .",the delivery of laboratory animals in a safe nonstressful manner is extremely important for their health and well - being and for the generation of scientifically valid research .
"in addition , the laboratory animal science association recently formed a transport working group with the goal of defining standards that ensure good practice and full compliance with national and international legislation governing laboratory animal transport ( swallow et al .","these regulations have also been accepted by the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora , the office international des epizooties , and the european union ( iata - lar ) ."
"in light of this situation , it becomes especially important to optimize transportation arrangements and ensure adequate quantities of feed , water , and bedding .","although the vendor is responsible for making appropriate arrangements , it is advisable for the researcher to be aware of the details of the transportation process ."
"in this circumstance , it is especially beneficial for the receiving institution to be aware of the specifics of airport pick - up and delivery .","delivery from the vendor to a local airport typically takes place in a vendor - owned dedicated vehicle , but an intermediate handler may provide ground transport from the airport to the final destination ."
"occasional unanticipated delays are inevitable , but these instances can be minimized through effective communications among the vendor , the carriers and intermediate handlers , and the research facility .",timely awareness by the research facility of delays in the process will minimize any negative impact .
"stocking densities are not specifically regulated by usda and iata for ferrets , but the animals must be able to turn around , lie down , and make normal postural adjustments .","these design elements include the following : viewing ports , ventilation areas , feed and watering devices , structural components that promote hygiene , and proper labeling ."
exceptions are sexually intact adult or breeder male ferrets ( staton and crowell - davis ) .,"in my eerience , to wk of age should be considered the minimum age for shipment of young ferrets without the mother ."
shipment containers for conventionally reared ferrets should be lined with contact bedding and equipped with containers for feed and water .,wire mesh or vent openings must allow for sufficient exchange of air but not compromise safety or hygiene from spilled bedding and excrement .
"in warm weather , particular attention must be paid to ambient temperatures and stocking densities because of the reduced airflow within these containers .",filtered containers designed for specific pathogen - free rodents are sometimes used for ferrets to prevent eure to influenza virus while in transit .
"this assessment is especially important for young or pregnant animals , during times of climatic extremes , or in the event of shipment delays .",early intervention is key to addressing potential complications such as dehydration and stress - related diarrhea or anorexia .
"in such a condition , a balanced electrolyte solution may be administered subcutaneously .","for ferrets , a lethargic or dehydrated condition is a medical emergency ."
"a thin gruel is made by adding warm water or milk replacer ( e . g . , kitten milk replacer ) to the pelleted diet and offering it to times daily to encourage both food and fluid consumption .",it is beneficial to offer a moist supplement in addition to a dry diet during the transition ( bell ) .
"many options exist , including large dog bowls , - to - inch diameter polyvinyl chloride pipes , fabric ferret hammocks or sleeping bags , and ferret tunneling toys .","to accommodate these needs , it is necessary to provide an enclosure with a solid bottom and sides , with or without an overhead cover ."
it is possible to minimize digging by providing a restricted access opening .,"if the feeder opens to the outside of the cage , the waist should be sufficiently narrow to preclude escape if the feeder is emptied ."
even nonbreeding sexually intact males may be housed together with some supervision .,"as mentioned above ( see transport containers ) , exceptions to group housing are adult or breeder hobs ( males ) and whelping jills ( females ) ."
"ferrets sleep together in groups , so the rest area that is provided should be sufficient to accommodate all of the inhabitants of a given enclosure .","social hierarchies exist , but usually not to the detriment of an individual animal ."
dog food is not suitable for ferrets due to the amount of cerealbased protein in most commercial diets .,"high - quality kitten food is acceptable , but there are also numerous commercially available ferret diets , including laboratory chows ( scipioni ball ) ."
"presently , a modified live chick embryo vaccine ( fervac d , united vaccines , madison , wi ) and a recombinant canary pox vectored vaccine ( purevax ferret , merial , duluth , ga ) are available .","although only a few vaccines are available , it is advisable to use only those that are licensed and approved for use in ferrets ( greenacre ) ."
"to an ineerienced observer , it may initially appear that the ferret is severely depressed or even comatose .","for example , if ferrets are approached while sleeping , it often takes approximately to sec for them to become fully roused ."
this posture results in some degree of ataxia of the rear quarters and may be a nonspecific sign .,"however , it also may be due to central nervous system involvement from systemic illness such as aleutian parvoviral disease ( quesenberry and carpenter , ch ."
another integral part of the health care program is awareness of common ferret diseases .,various infectious and inflammatory diseases may be observed in ferrets in the laboratory .
"although infestations are usually subclinical , consequences such as otitis may occur .",treatments that have been described and compared include topical use of ivermectin in propylene glycol ( patterson and kirchain ) .
"for some institutions , it is also necessary to develop a breeding program in support of their research .","as described above ( see research - related ferret selection criteria and biology ) , some investigators may require ferret neonates for studies such as visual system development ."
"clinically , loss of body condition and pale mucous membranes are noted .","as mentioned above ( see research - related ferret selection criteria and biology ) , jills that remain in heat for longer than to wk develop risk for estrogen - induced bone marrow suppression ."
"whether ferrets are bred in - house or purchased as timed pregnant jills , researchers should be aware that pregnant ferrets are subject to pregnancy toxemia .","the disease is characterized by anorexia , depression , ketosis , and fatty liver ( batchelder et al ."
"if pregnant jills are received at the end of the second trimester , they should be housed in a cage that is suitable for parturition and equipped with a bedded nest .",this supplement may be offered twice daily and should be continued throughout lactation because it will also serve to initiate the weaning process for the kits .
"if parturition begins earlier than or later than days , the prognosis for a successful outcome is guarded .","the gestation period for ferrets is to days , with little variation ."
"it is critical to have quiet surroundings during delivery , and the whelp nest should provide privacy for the jill .","it is important to monitor parturition to prevent dystocia or entanglement of umbilical cords ( quesenberry and carpenter , ch ."
the progress of the litter may be sufficiently ascertained without removing the jill from the nest or handling the kits .,"even once parturition is complete , it is best to continue to minimize disturbances for the next several days ."
cross - fostering is especially useful given the difficulty of hand rearing neonates .,"ferret jills have strong maternal instincts , which make cross - fostering a simple procedure even when delivery dates are not coincident ."
"regardless , the key to successful nonstressful handling is acclimation of the ferret to whatever method of restraint will be required .",this goal should be accomplished well in advance of initiation of the eerimental procedure .
this method of restraint is particularly useful for taking a rectal temperature or giving an intramuscular injection ( scipioni ball ) .,"hugging the ferret in this manner appears to offer them security , which minimizes resistance ."
humane euthanasia may be achieved by using injectable sedation or anesthesia followed by barbiturate euthanasia .,the report of the american veterinary medical association panel on euthanasia ( avma ) should be utilized for guidance on appropriate and humane methods of euthanasia .
"although the number of animals used may be small compared with other laboratory animal species , they occupy a distinct niche in research .","ferrets are used to study the pathogenesis and treatment of a variety of important human diseases , including influenza , sars , peptic ulcer disease , and cystic fibrosis to name only a few ."
"despite the possibility that researchers may be less familiar with ferrets than with other laboratory species , it is important for investigators to realize that ferrets may be selected , purchased , and transported in a manner similar to other animals .",caging systems are readily accessible either commercially or through modification of pre - existing equipment .
"successful use of the ferret in the laboratory also requires familiarity with their unique behaviors , training in proper methods of restraint , and a regular routine of handling .",acclimation to research procedures is crucial to minimize stress and promote well - being .
efforts to prepare ferrets as research subjects in the laboratory are successfully achieved only through in - depth study .,such study ensures a thorough understanding of the needs of these interesting animals .
some of the inferential and philosophical issues that arise are discussed along with the scope of potential application of the new method .,"second , we show the generality of the method for retrospective analysis of epidemics by applying it to a spatially extended arboreal epidemic in which we demonstrate the relative effectiveness of host culling strategies that differ in frequency and spatial extent ."
"to answer this , we need to determine what would have occurred had an alternative , mooted choice of control been implemented .","following the cessation of the outbreak , one question that naturally arises is : was the right choice of control made ?"
was the best choice made in the light of what is known now ?,was the best choice made given what was known at the time of the decision ?
non - intervention is also considered to be an intervention strategy the actual or historic epidemic is the one that did occur in a given place and time under the actual or historic intervention strategy a mooted or alternative intervention strategy is one that may differ from the actual intervention strategy ( it may also be the same ) a notional epidemic is one that did not occur but might have occurred had a mooted intervention strategy been effected rather than the actual one parametric information encapsulates the uncertainty in the parameters of a model .,an intervention strategy is any action that may change the way an epidemic invades a population .
"after the outbreak is over , an alternative mooted intervention r is considered which would have been implemented at time t mooted .","this would have resulted in the notional trajectory x , which has a distribution reflecting our uncertainty in the parameters and trajectory ."
this is done by matching the latent processes generating epidemics that differ only through the effect of the intervention strategies used .,we follow this by introducing the methodology that allows historic and notional epidemics to be coupled .
"the question of the prospective appropriateness of differing control strategies is , in principle at least , easy to answer using statistical decision theory ( berger ) .","we denote the unknown parameters by q , the actual epidemic process by x , the original choice of intervention by r and observed data by d ( x ) ."
"this is inappropriate , though , if the distribution of x tot is in any way dependent on x tot , which will be the case if both parametric and trajectory - based information are to be fully utilized .","it may initially appear that a similar approach can be used retrospectively to find the best decision at time t based on what we know at the present ( time t , say ) , replacing d x t ! t by d x t ! t in the algorithm above ."
this requires that pairs of epidemics be coupled so that the distribution of the effect of one intervention conditional on that of another can be determined .,an alternative approach is needed to make full use of all information at our disposal .
this scenario holds when we attempt to devise retrospectively optimal designs of observation schemes ( cook et al .,"we assume that collecting the data has no bearing on the epidemic outcome ( no pathogens are inadvertently spread by the collectors , for example ) so that the actual epidemic process x is maintained regardless of whether r or r is carried out , although d ( x ) and d (x ) differ ."
the distribution of x conditioned on our knowledge of x then gives our best prediction of what would have happened had the notional intervention been chosen rather than the actual one .,"by analogy , one way to evaluate the effect of a notional intervention strategy on an historic epidemic is to seek the joint distribution of two epidemics x and x that differ in some sense only through the effect of their intervention strategies r and r ."
"the problem is that there are many different choices of z , and in general they give different results .","in selecting a z process to match different interventions , we propose the following desiderata :"
one common way of modelling an epidemic is as a modified poisson process .,"if hosts mix homogeneously and contact sufficient for disease to spread occurs at a constant rate b , say , between each pair of hosts , then the occurrence of contacts in the population is a collection of poisson processes of rate b . non - homogeneous mixing of hosts may also be accounted for by allowing b to vary with the distance ( in space or social space ) between hosts ( as in the example in ) , for example ."
"the infinite nature of the poisson z process is computationally undesirable , so we seek an alternative that is more manageable and yet functionally similar .","we therefore consider a construction due to sellke , which is an equivalent way of formulating standard stochastic epidemic processes ."
now suppose that we have observed x completely and thus know t a and t b .,"under the sellke construction , there is a one - to - one mapping between the latent process z and infection times given the parameters , and so the notional infection time for b takes a point mass at t"
"in practice , it is justifiable to use the sellke as an approximation to the poisson construction .",i + r i + r alternative intervention strategies a . r . cook et al .
"motivated by the case study in , consider a homogeneously mixing population of size nz262 with rate of infection per s - i pair ( as in equation ( 3.5 ) ) bz0 . 003 and rate of recovery per infected individual gz0 . 66 .",this similarity of behaviour is illustrated through the following simulation example based upon the general sir epidemic ( bailey ) .
"for this case , the sellke construction provides an excellent approximation to the joint distribution of the number of infectives i and i generated under the poisson construction , with the two quantities strongly correlated .",also shown is the relationship taking the notional disease trajectory to be independent of the true one after times tz0 and .
"letting bx be the rate after days , the two strategies we consider are r : xz0 . 5 and r : xz0 . 9 .","the control strategies whose effectiveness we wish to investigate take the form of reductions to b days after the first removal , perhaps due to warnings issued by the island ' s physician to reduce contact with other islanders ."
"under our fully retrospective approach , however , we would instead predict a small decrease in the numbers of infections ( figure b ) .","when the change is more marked ( xz0 . 5 , figure c , d ) , the eected behaviour under the two approaches is similar , but taking the semi - retrospective approach inflates the variance considerably relative to the fully retrospective approach , yielding considerably poorer predictions ."
"we investigate the effect of notional removal strategies in which , at intervals of d days , all trees are assessed for infection .",infection is detected with probability q ( including qz1 ) : trees found to be infected are removed immediately along with all other trees within a circle of radius r metres centred on the infected tree .
"for the purposes of illustrating the methodology , here we focus exclusively on a simple criterion for the effectiveness of intervention : the total number of trees removed relative to the numbers infected in the historic epidemic .","this does not take account of the force of infection generated by the population , nor of the costs of surveying and removing trees ."
"in figure , we present mean and % credible regions for p i fi i t gc fi r t g ( i . e .","the number of trees lost to disease and / or removal ) against time , under three interventions : removals every days ( dz60 , qz1 , rz0 ) , removals every days ( dz120 , qz1 , rz0 ) and % removals every days ( dz120 , pz0 . 4 , rz0 ) ."
"however , this and the other study areas were unusual in that disease was allowed to increase without intervention by the regulatory agencies specifically so that the epidemic could be studied to aid the development of intervention strategies .",) and pro - actively culling trees only in some areas allows disease to be reintroduced from elsewhere .
coupling epidemics by matching their latent processes allows us to make full use of both parametric and trajectory - based information .,"by so doing , we avoid paradoxical results that may often occur when information about the epidemic trajectory is only partially used ; these include predictions of a high probability of a more severe epidemic occurring with more effective controls than were used in reality ( figure ) ."
"it preserves patterns wholly when the mooted intervention has effects identical to the actual one , and partly and decreasingly so when the mooted intervention changes more and more from the actual one .","when the mooted intervention is drastically different from the actual one , all trajectory information is lost , and our approach gives predictions that match those using the semi - retrospective approach ."
"retrospective approach rests on an assumption : that the notional invasion trajectory is independent of the actual one , i . e .",that the occurrence of events in the observed epidemic has no correlation with their occurrence in the notional outbreak .
the main philosophical issue with any approach to evaluating the benefits provided by the actual intervention compared with the outcome of an alternative strategy is that the relationship between a notional and the actual epidemic can never be verified .,"this is not a new issue in modelling : in making any predictions based on a model , we implicitly trust that the model provides a reasonable description of reality and may be extrapolated to future or alternative conditions ."
this may be effected within the current framework by suitably adapting the utility function .,"the most pressing extension of the work is to incorporate economic factors such as treatment costs , in order to identify economically optimal strategies ( forster & gilligan ) ."
results show that the sdeathp system can obtain higher fresh air supply temperature in winter and lower fresh air supply temperature in summer .,"the system requires only 2 w of power for the fans , and the average relative cooling coefficient in summer and the average relative heating coefficient can reach and , respectively ."
research showed that fresh air systems consume about - 40% of the total energy consumption of the air - conditioning systems .,"therefore , development of fresh air equipment and systems to re - duce the energy consumption of fresh air is of great significance to building energy conservation ."
"however , since these passive waste heat recovery systems use the temperature or enthalpy difference between the outdoor fresh air and indoor air to drive the system , the temperature of the fresh air supply from the passive heat recovery systems are always higher in summer and lower in winter than the indoor temperature .",active energy recovery systems can recover latent heat of the exhaust air and active control of fresh air temperature and humidity .
some solar thermoelectric cooling systems have been investigated in recent years .,"liu developed a photovoltaic thermal - compound thermoelectric ventilator ( pvt - tev ) system , in which photovoltaic thermal ( pvt ) collector generates electricity in winter and simultaneously preheats the fresh air to achieve comprehensive utilization of solar energy [ , - 20 ] ."
"moreover , with its power generation in situ and used in situ , and with no battery or inverter , the sdeathp system can save the investment in power grid and reduce the loss of power transmission and distribution .","in order to prove the feasibility of the sdeathp system , the solar - driven ex - haust air thermoelectric heat pump recovery ( sdeathp ) system is tested and evaluated for its ability to recover thermal energy from exhaust air to cool or heat fresh air ."
the sdeathp system has no power consumption except that for the fans because it uses solar energy to drive the eathp system .,"in addition , with power generation in situ and used in situ , and with no battery or inverter , the sdeathp system is low in cost ."
the voltage and current of the pv system were recorded by a digital multimeter .,air velocity was measured by a digital anemometer thermal wind speed tester air flow meter ( ar866 ) .
"where i is the current of the pv module ( a ) , u is the voltage of the pv module ( v ) , a pvt is the pv collector area ( m ) , and g is the solar radiation ( w / m ) .",the cooling capacity in cooling mode ( qc ) and heating capacity in heating mode ( qh ) of sdeathp system are calculated by :
cop c is the system coefficient of performance of the sdeathp in cooling mode and cop h is the system coefficient of performance of sdeathp in heating mode .,"where p is the electric power provided by pv system , and w is the power consumption of the fan ."
it can be seen that the voltage and current increase as solar irradiation increases .,"in cooling mode , the current is a and the voltage is v when the solar radiation is w / m ."
"in addition to working in summer and winter , the sdeathp system can also handle fresh air in swing season .","because of the decrease in outdoor fresh air temperature and in photovoltaic cell temperature in swing season , the photovoltaic cell power generation efficiency increases as compared with that in summer ."
there are different options for performance simulation of photovoltaic cells .,"in this study , the single diode r p - model ( five - parameter method ) is selected to calculate the performance of the photovoltaic ."
"when photovoltaic cell is directly connected to thermoelectric modules , the specific operating point of the thermoelectric system can be determined in the i - u curves of the photovoltaic cell according to the electrical characteristics of the thermoelectric cooling system .","for a pv cell under actual operating conditions , the pv cell output current value is determined by the resistance value of the connected load ."
"- ( : where i is the total current of the eathp system , and v is the total voltage of the eathp system .","i te is the current of the single thermoelectric module , v te is the voltage of the single thermoelectric module , p te is the power consumption of the single te modules , x is the number of the te modules in series , and y is the number of the te modules in parallel , a is the seebeck coefficient , r te is the module ' s electrical resistance , and t is the temperature difference of the cold side and hot side of the te modules ."
"when using the and te module , the pv operating point is far from the maximum efficiency point .","when te modules are used , the system performs better at the solar irradiance of - 80 w / m , and when the solar irradiance is below w / m or above w / m , the system is far from the maximum power point of the pv system ."
an eerimental test platform was established under actual climatic conditions to analyze its performance .,"the sdeathp system uses solar energy to drive thermoelectric heat pump , and has no power consumption except for the fans ."
"in the future , energy storage technologies can be used to control fresh air temperature .","due to the fluctuation of solar radiation intensity , the fresh air temperature of the system has certain fluctuations ."
reversing the time axis is valid only when the density function for infection is uniform in chronologic time .,"this condition should be reasonable in the setting of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus , with each eure interval being relatively short ."
we found that the gamma distribution had the best bayesian index criterion value .,"we assumed consequently a gamma distribution with parameters ( k , ) and probability density function"
we then considered approaches to estimate the association between the risk for death ( outcome ) and the incubation period ( elanatory variable ) .,"we compared the mean incubation period between these groups by using the , 000 posterior samples of each couple of parameters ( k , ) ."
"let p be the probability of death , which we assume to be dependent on age ( g ) , sex ( s ) and incubation period ( as in logistic regression :","let f and f be the pdf and cdf of the incubation period , assumed to be gamma distributed with parameters k and and stratified by clinical outcome ( fatal and nonfatal cases ) ."
"if case i is in a1 , then the probability of death is simply qi = p ( gi , si , xi ) .","if case i is in a2 , then the probability of death is"
"we also defined a logistic regression model by using incubation times resampled from the , 000 posterior samples .","this approach enabled us to simulate the distribution with imputed values for individual incubation periods , which was particularly useful for an analysis in which we stratified incubation periods into tertiles ."
"moreover , , 000 samples from posterior distributions of incubation periods t for each patient estimated were used in the logistic regression model .",", 000 samples of the incubation periods t for each patient were drawn by using markov chain monte carlo methods ."
"moreover , clinical survey was carried out among dairy cattle from herds , for diarrhea syndrome , respiratory problems and reproductive failure , and pathogens of all clinical cattle were further investigated .","individual animal status in two herds was further investigated collecting blood samples , the positive ratio was 4% and 4% , and the average positive ratio of calves , heifers , and lactating cows was 4% , 6% , and %, respectively ."
"in this study , bulk tank milk and blood samples were analyzed by blocking elisa for monitoring the herd and individual infection status , and clinical manifestations were surveyed for the causative pathogens ; then , viruses were isolated , prevalence of pi with bvdv was further investigated , and phylogenetic analysis was performed to identify the circulating bvdv subtypes currently .","collectively , this study has a better understanding of the epidemic of bvdv among dairy cattle in eastern china ."
"bulk tank milk samples were collected from dairy herds and centrifuged to be skimmed at g , min c .","three different layers appeared in the tube after the centrifugation , a middle layer corresponding to milk serum samples was collected , and stored at c in sterile plastic tubes until its analysis with bvd / md p80 - elisa test kit ( laboratorios hipra s . a . spain ) ."
samples were centrifuged at g for min to obtain the sera and stored at c for further analysis .,"to further investigate the individual status of herds identified as bvdv positive by analysis of bulk tank milk samples , peripheral blood samples were collected from the two herds ( herd number and herd number ) by jugular or coccygeal vein puncture ."
"for rna viruses , cdna was synthesized from ng of total rna using rna reverse transcription kit .","total rna and / or dna was extracted from clinical samples or cell cultures using viral rna / dna extraction kit ver . 4.0 ( takara , japan ) as described by the manufacturer ' s instructions ."
"if the cpe was not found , the cultures were frozen and thawed twice and the clarified supernatant was passaged five times in mdbk cells .",the infected mdbk cells were checked daily and appearance of cytopathic effects ( cpe ) was observed and recorded .
"firstly , we analyzed bulk tank milk samples from dairy cattle herds with bvd / bd p80 blocking ) with prevalence of positive animals < % ; % in value higher or equal to and lower than indicates prevalence of positive animals between % and % ( labeled p ) .","in order to investigate the prevalence of bvdv , dairy cattle herds distributed in provinces ( shandong , anhui , hebei , jiangsu , and fujian ) in eastern china were selected since these areas were historically the major regions with dairy cattle production and trade ."
the bp fragment of the - utr regions of each isolated virus was amplified and sequenced .,"evolutionary analyses conducted in mega5 based on the sequence of the - utr showed that eight bvdv strains were bvdv - 1 , and bvdv a and c were the dominant genotypes ."
virus isolation in this study was performed because it is commonly considered to be the gold standard for diagnosis of bvdv ( lanyon et al .,"a , b ) , and eight ncp and bvdv - 1 strains as well as one cp and bvdv - 2 strain were successfully isolated ."
"taken together , we determined the prevalence of bvdv in eastern china and found that bvdv was widely spread in herds , and ncp and bvdv1a and bvdv - 1 c were the dominant biotype and genotype of isolates .","moreover , high ratio of pi animals increased the risk of disease within feedlots ."
the global epidemic of this infection emerged in guangdong province in southern china in november .,"this infection is frequently associated with rapid deterioration in infected patients and the mortality rate is very high , especially in elderly patients ."
special designated hospitals in various regions of china were assigned to treat patients with sars only .,"with increasing understanding of the condition and the recognition of the magnitude of the problem by the central chinese government , effective control measures including proper isolation of infected cases , meticulous contact tracing , appropriate quarantine and stringent infection control measures in the healthcare facilities , were introduced ."
it was postulated that the use of the jet nebuliser in the index patient might have generated large amounts of infective droplets in the environment .,the exact reason causing such an extensive outbreak was not clear .
there were several hypotheses that tried to elain the extent of the outbreak .,he had visited his relatives living at amoy gardens a few times .
"because of the heightened index of suspicion and implementation of proper infection control measures , very few cases in these countries were healthcare workers and the disease did not spread into the communities .","other than the outbreaks mentioned above , other countries have reported cases in people who had recently travelled to the affected regions ( table ) ."
"in hong kong and singapore , % and % of the patients were healthcare workers respectively .",there was a slight female predominance as many of the infected healthcare workers were nurses .
almost all infected children had close contact with an infected adult in the same household .,n . - s . zhong and g . w . k . wong kong were under years of age .
"with the advance of modern molecular biological techniques , scientists are able to trace the possible origin of the virus and the spread of infection .",early in the outbreak of sars the who quickly established a laboratory network around the world to facilitate the collaboration in search of the responsible infectious agent .
the second case was a waitress working at a restaurant where wildlife animals were processed as game food .,"a close linkage of sars - cov between human beings and small wild mammals , in particular civet cats , was suspected ."
"when she returned home to hefei , the capital city of anhui province , she was diagnosed as having sars and transmitted the disease to another seven people including her parents and healthcare workers both in beijing and hefei .","with regards to the second sars event , a young postgraduate working at an institute of virology in beijing from march to march , developed symptoms of pneumonia on march ."
health authorities will have to evaluate the risk of allowing sales of wild animals for human consumption as well as the operations of wet markets in china and other asian countries .,"similar to epidemics caused by new strains of influenza , sars coronavirus is most likely to originate from animal species ."
"this problem was encountered by the countries most aff ected , governmental and non - governmental organisations , and even who .","the early response to the ebola epidemic , however , was also accompanied by several examples of individuals and organisations being unwilling to share data in real time , including data that was vital for public health planning in this diffi cult , fast - moving emergency ."
"during the recent ebola outbreak the main reasons given for not sharing data or giving early notifi cation of results to responders were the perceived disincentives to share data , the lack of a mechanism to enable data sharing , and the absence of positive incentives to share data .",three disincentives were frequently mentioned : data sharing would jeopardise subsequent publication ; it would allow pre - emptive use of data by others for their own publications ; and it would breach confi dentiality agreements .
"individual journal editors have already made clear that putting data or results into the hands of responders , or indeed public databases , will not threaten subsequent publication .","the international committee of medical journal editors ( icmje ) may well formalise this position at their forthcoming annual meeting , and this decision would be very welcome since it removes one perceived disincentive ."
"there is no standardised best practice framework for data sharing during outbreaks , and no widely available standardised platforms and mechanism for such data sharing .","who and others are moving to set up public databases that should help improve mechanisms for data sharing , although these would need to be optimised for public health use as well as scientifi c sharing early in epidemics ."
health puts a human face on what can sometimes seem to be a distant threat .,"when climate change is framed as a health issue , rather than purely as an environmental , economic , or technological challenge , it becomes clear that we are facing a predicament that strikes at the heart of humanity ."
such a recommendation would provide a strong but not an onerous positive incentive .,the model for this suggestion is the farsighted decision by icmje journal editors not to accept trials that have not been prospectively registered .
"although those who did not share data and information at the earliest opportunity were a minority in this global eff ort , this failure was damaging .","as users , funders , and producers of research we are proud of the part the academic and public health community played alongside courageous clinical staff in helping to combat ebola , as it has in other global health emergencies ."
"rapid diagnostic tests for use outside of laboratories are now available on the open market , and even if their sensitivity remains lower than that of other techniques , it is likely that they will become widely used , especially in doctors ' offices , in the near future .","currently in most laboratories , however , diagnosis of viral respiratory infections is still done using techniques based on detection of viral antigens , especially immunofluorescence assays ."
"ebola virus ( ebov ) is an enveloped filovirus with a - kb , negative - sense , single - stranded rna genome that causes sporadic outbreaks of lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans ( feldmann and geisbert , ; kuhn et al . , ) .","ebov was identified as a human pathogen in ( bowen et al . , ; johnson et al . , ; pattyn et al . , ) ."
"historically , ebola virus disease ( evd ) outbreaks have been geographically limited and resolved after at most a few hundred cases ( cdc , ) .","in contrast , the epidemic caused by the ebov makona variant was much larger : it began in guinea in ( baize et al . , ) , spread to sierra leone and liberia in , and infected more than , 000 people before it was controlled in ( who , ) ."
"although sociological and epidemiological factors were central to the - 2016 epidemic ' s unprecedented scale ( alexander et al . , ) , researchers have also examined the possibility that genetic changes unique to ebov makona played a role .","to date , eeriments with ebov makona have not detected evidence for increased replication phenotypes ."
here we describe our efforts to determine whether gp - a82v conferred a replication advantage to the virus .,this mutation is particularly intriguing because it is located in the receptor - binding domain of ebov gp .
"aside from gp - a82v , t230a was the most frequently observed nonsynonymous mutation ( 2.5% ) outside of the mucin - like domain .","instead , we focused on a sub - lineage of gp - a82v with an a - to - g change at nucleotide , 726 that results in a gp - a82v / t230a double mutant ( figure a ) ."
"in contrast , pseudotypes bearing either of the single mutants gp - t230a or gp - d637g produced gfp - positive cells at a rate similar to the ancestral gp .","lentiviruses bearing gp - a82v , gp - a82v / t230a , or gp - a82v / t230a / d637g produced - fold more gfp - positive cells than did particles bearing the ancestral gp ( figure a ) ."
"once again , no statistically significant changes were observed with transductions using either of the single mutants gp - t230a or gp - d637g .","in hek293 cells , a - fold increase in infectivity was observed with lentiviral particles pseudotyped with gp - a82v , gp - a82v / t230a , or gp - a82v / t230a / d637g ( figure b ) ."
we therefore looked at the effect of the gp mutants on infection of this critical cell type ( figure c ) .,"dendritic cells ( dcs ) are targets for ebov replication in vivo , at both early and later stages of infection ( geisbert et al . , ) ."
"to determine whether any of these properties were changed by the ebov gp mutants , the amount of ancestral versus mutant gp present in our ebov gp - pseudotyped lentiviruses was compared .","ebov gp - pseudotyped lentiviruses were enriched by acceleration through a % sucrose cushion , and virion - associated proteins were analyzed by western blotting , using polyclonal antiserum against a v5 epitope tag that was appended to the carboxyl terminus of the gp ."
gp - a82v - or gp - a82v / t230a - bearing particles exhibited a significant increase in entry as compared with the ancestral ebov gp ( figure ) .,"b - lactamase - containing vlps bearing ancestral or mutant ebov gps were incubated with u2os target cells , and then cells were loaded with the fluorogenic substrate ."
"gp - a82v increases infectivity in primate cells but not in cells from other species next , we determined whether gp - a82v was more infectious for cells of any permissive species or whether the increased infectivity was a human - specific adaptation .","npc1 is the main cellular receptor for ebov ( carette et al . , ; c t et al . , ) , and the ebov gp - interacting region of npc1 has been well defined ( gong et al . , ; krishnan et al . , ; wang et al . , ) ."
"outside of primates , nearly all species have a non - polar amino acid at residue , the exception being rabbits ( oryctolagus cuniculus ) , which have a glutamine .","only two species , the new world monkey callithrix jacchus and the lemur microcebus murinus , harbor amino acid differences from those found in human npc1 : k499i in callithrix jacchus and k499v in microcebus murinus ."
"r85 extends into a charged pocket present on the opposite side of the a1 helix to where npc1 interaction occurs and the nitrogens of the terminal guanidinium group are likely to form ionic interactions with the sidechains of e178 , y109 , and the backbone hydroxyl group of a76 .","on the host side , several amino acid differences in the npc1 loop domain among mammals are likely to impact filovirus susceptibility in a species - specific manner zhao et al . , ) ."
"all but of these cases occurred in guinea , so the analysis was further restricted to guinea , with samples from districts .","after paring down the data , geographic differences in the prevalence of viral genotypes remained ( figure b ) ."
"infection by virus with gp - a82v was associated with a significantly higher risk of death ( raw odds ratio : 4 , % ci [ 1.29 , 8] ; figure e ) .","gp - a82v - infected individuals had slightly higher viral loads ( lower c ( t ) value , figure d ) , but the difference was not statistically significant ( student ' s t test : mean a = 7 , mean v = 8 , % ci for difference in the means ; p value = 9 ) ."
"to better understand the association between gp - a82v and mortality , we modeled the fatality rates for both the ancestral and gp - a82v genotypes over a range of viral loads ( transformed c ( t ) values ) ( figure f ) .","after correcting for differences in c ( t ) values , the adjusted odds ratio for gp - a82v remained above , but with a wide confidence interval ( or = 9 , % ci [ 0.94 , 4 ] ) ."
"the a82v mutation in ebov makona gp arose early during the outbreak , nearly replacing the ancestral genotype , and was present in the viruses responsible virus - like particles ( vlps ) were generated with ebov vp40 - b - lactamase fusion protein and either the ancestral ebov gp or one of the indicated mutants .","u2os cells were incubated with vlp - containing supernatant for hr at c , then for hr at c , and then loaded with ccf4 - am overnight at c . cleavage of ccf4 - am was measured using a fluorescent plate reader with / 30 excitation and / 40 emission filters ."
"given that gp - a82v is located at the npc1 binding interface , we are left with a strong suspicion that gp - a82v represents an ebov adaptation to the human host .",our data show that gp - a82v enhances infectivity in human and other primate cells but not in cells of other mammalian species ( figures and4 ) .
"in their hands , gp - a82v enhanced infectivity within the context of numerous gp sequences observed during the outbreak .","complementary to our findings , they showed that gp - a82v has decreased infectivity for a variety of bat cell lines , species with amino acid substitutions in npc1 binding loop that are similar to those in the non - primate species tested here ( figures and5 ) ."
"these eerimental findings involving influenza have allowed for more informed surveillance of the animal reservoirs as well as providing a better understanding of the ongoing viral evolution in humans ( dugan et al . , ; holmes et al . , ; nelson et al . , ; obenauer et al . , ; rambaut et al . , ; russell et al . , ) .","the knowledge that ebov gp mutations that modulate fusion to host cells may be a route for human adaptation , and which gp residues mediate this adaptation is potentially valuable knowledge for surveillance activities during future ebov epidemics ."
"in addition , the added ' ' bulk ' ' of the gp - a82v mutation may alter the a1 helix conformation , to provide better access for proximal resides , such as gp - v79 , - p80 , - t83 , and - w86 , to interact with npc1 .","steric hindrance between v82 and r85 may alter a predicted salt bridge between r85 and e178 ( $2.7 apart , figure ) ."
"in this context , the triggering process refers to the dramatic conformational changes undertaken by the ebov gp resulting in the eure of the viral fusion peptide on gp2 , which is normally sequestered by gp1 .",propensity for ebov gp to undergo ' ' triggering ' ' upon interaction with npc1 .
"finally , studies such as this are necessary , as they provide vital biological information crucial for the interpretation of viral sequence evolution .","having this connection between viral genotype and phenotype maximizes the utility of viral sequencing efforts during outbreaks , allowing more efficient targeting of intervention strategies ."
fifty consecutive runs were performed and the tree with the best likelihood score was bootstrapped with pseudoreplicates .,"maximum likelihood phylogenies were made with raxml v7 . 3.0 ( stamatakis et al . , ) using the gtrg nucleotide substitution model ."
all cells were maintained at c in % co humidified incubators .,"hek293 , u2os , crfk , nih / 3 t3 , and mdtf were maintained in dmem supplemented with % fbs ."
this sequence contained flanking ncoi and xbai restriction enzyme sites and was cloned into a mammalian eression vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early ( cmv ie ) promoter / enhancer .,"it was engineered to lack the mucin domain ( amino acids - 489 ) ( chandran et al . , ) and to contain an additional adenosine at nucleotide , a modification that substitutes for the transcriptional editing that bona fide ebov uses to produce full - length glycoprotein ( sanchez et al . , ) ."
"in order to make coefficient estimates consistent between the continuous variables and the binary variable , we standardized the continuous variables by subtracting the mean and dividing by two standard deviations ( gelman , ) .","to facilitate interpretation of the results , we flipped the sign of the resulting variable such that it was consistent with viral load ( which is inversely related to c ( t ) ) ."
eloration of the model showed no association between sampling date and outcome and this variable was subsequently dropped of the model .,"we also allowed each location to have its own coefficient for the cumcases variables , such that the structure of the model allowed for variability in how locations responded to demand for health care ."
using all data for which c ( t ) values and genotype information was available ( regardless of outcome information ) we obtained c ( t ) measurements for genotype gp - 8 2 a and measurements for genotype gp - a82v .,a comparison of c ( t ) values per genotype was performed using a student t test .
the v5tagged constructs did indeed have the same phenotype as the untagged constructs ( data not shown ) .,for determination of ebola virus gp incorporation into viral particles hek293 cells were transfected according to the procedure above substituting plasmids encoding c - terminally v5 - tagged ebola virus gps for the corresponding untagged versions .
"for imaging on the li - cor odyssey clx system ( li - cor ) , primary antibody was recognized by goat anti - rabbit - 680 and goat anti - mouse - 800 ( li - cor ) , both at : 10,000 dilutions .","hiv - 1 lentiviral ca ( p24 ) was detected using mouse monoclonal antibody - h12 - 5 c ( chesebro et al . , ) at a : 1,000 dilution ."
we find that the variability in the data and possibly the relatively small number of observations lead to very broad estimates of the model parameters .,"varying - intercept model for fatality rates , related to figure we fit a model that allowed each location to have its own base fatality rate ( i . e . , its own intercept ) and also its own slope for the cumulative cases ( cumcases ) variable , in order to account for heterogeneity in how locations responded to demand for healthcare ."
"the final result of this scheme may be "" dying - back gliopathy , "" the alteration being noted first in the most distal extension of the oligodendrocyte - that is , the myelin sheaths .","a paradigm for induction of primary demyelination is proposed in which immune cells recognize "" foreign "" antigens on the surface of oligodendrocytes in the context of major histocompatibility complex gene products ."
the plaques are characterized by primary demyelination ( destruction of myelin sheaths with preservation of ans ) and death of oligodendro cytes ( myelin - producing cells ) within the center of the lesion .,"during the early evolution of the plaque , perivascular inflammatory cells ( lymphocytes , plasma cells , macrophages ) invade the substance of the white matter and are thought to play a critical role in myelin destruction ."
"the class ii gene products , found primarily on macrophages and b cells , are important in presentation of antigen to t cells .","this function is of particular importance because cd4 + and c + t cells recognize foreign antigen in the context of class ii ( hla - dr , la ) or class i ( hla - abc ) mhc gene products , respectively ."
"because linkage disequilibria exist between these class i alleles and dr2 , the possible increased representation of one group of alleles may merely reflect this phenomenon .","north ern caucasians with ms have an overrepresentation of the a3 , b7 , dr2 , and dw2 histocompatibility al leles with relative risks of to for the class i mhc alleles ( a3 , b7 ) and to for class ii mhc alleles ( dr2 , dw2 ) ."
"the indefinite association between susceptibility and mhc haplotypes suggests that either more than one gene is involved or a strong environmental agent "" breaks through "" to disease in the absence of the ms susceptibility allele .","the frequency of occurrence of a2 , b12 , dr7 , and dw7 is decreased in patients with ms . the data that pertain to this occurrence are in much better agreement , suggesting that some mhc alleles may protect against ms . investigators have also reported that some mhc alleles ( dr2 ) are asso ciated with more progressive disease whereas others ( dr3 ) are associated with more benign disease ."
"for more distant relatives , concor dance for ms is lower but exceeds chance eectation .","in contrast , for non - blood - relatives living together ( for example , husband and wife ) , the concordance for ms is not increased above chance ."
"in diseases that are known to be caused by a virus ( subacute sclerosing panencephalitis [ measles ] and mumps meningitis ) , igg and oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid are directed almost exclusively against the infectious agent .","in many patients with ms , however , antibody titers to two or more viruses are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid ."
"two approaches to distinguish whether antibody is "" nonsense "" or "" sense "" have been used : analysis of banding patterns of igg eluted from different ms plaques in the same patient and study of idiotypes ( combining sites of antibody molecules ) of the oli goclonal igg in cerebrospinal fluid from multiple patients .",the first approach showed that each ms plaque may have unique igg banding patterns .
"in visna virus , macrophages that are persistently infected are actively in volved in the demyelinating process .","in contrast , in rats the demyehnation by jhm may be a consequence of autoimmune mechanisms by which sensitized t cells recognize myelin antigens ."
"several hypotheses have been proposed to elain the clinical and eerimental features of this demyelinating disorder , three of which will be discussed .",they are relevant to the possibility of an immunemediated demyelination triggered by viral infection .
"the myelin antigens may be presented to helper t cells ( cd4 + ) by endothelial cells or astrocytes , which are known to carry class ii mhc antigens in ms lesions .","as a result of t - cell activa tion , lymphokines and macrophages could mediate myelin destruction ."
"during the defense against this infec tion , t lymphocytes and macrophages are recruited to the lesion .",the scenario would be that viruses or other infectious agents frequently invade the central ner vous system .
"it may be argued , however , that genetic factors control whether specific lymphokines that could in duce demyelination are released .","if bystander demyelination were more prominent , then demyelination would occur each time the immune system interacts with viruses that infect the central nervous system ( that is , measles , mumps , and her pes ) ."
virus would be cleared from the central nervous system without long - term sequelae .,"in resistant hosts , viral antigens would be recog nized in the context of class i or class ii mhc gene products , and viral replication would be limited as a consequence of a protective immune response ."
"during the course of infection , the virus could infect oligodendrocytes in a manner such that novel antigens are present on the surface of these cells ( fig .","in susceptible hosts , absence of specific mhc gene products may result in failure of clearance of the virus ; thus , the virus persists in glial cells ."
the final result would be injury to the myelinproducing cell or to the myelin sheath .,"this result may occur as a dying - back gliopathy , the altera tion being noted first in the most distal extension of the oligodendrocytes ( that is , the glial loops and myelin sheaths ) and interfering with the differential function of the oligodendrocyte ( that is , the mainte nance of myelin ) ."
"the high prevalence of diarrhoeal disease seen is not due to frequent attacks of "" acute infantile diarrhoea "" of viral origin .","the picture of protracted diarrhoea is almost certainly due to colonization of the upper bowel and the high prevalence demonstrated to be at least partly due to the environment to which the children are eed , particularly in terms of food and water hygiene ."
the extent of this contribution is such that an intervention programme intended to improve the nutritional status of these children could be eected to achieve only limited success if it is based on dietary measures alone .,diarrhoeal illness contributes almost exclusively the non - dietary element in failure to grow .
"one may speculate that radical improvements in water supply , sanitation and personal hygiene could be eected to reduce the amount of diarrhoeal disease occurring ( watt et al . , ; hollister et al . , ; morley , ) .","such an approach , however , holds out little hope of early alleviation of the problems facing an isolated rural community such as keneba ."
our overall aim is to try to determine some simple specific measures that can be introduced at rural village level to reduce the contribution of diarrhoeal disease to growth failure .,"clearly , before this can be achieved a better understanding is required of what has hitherto been referred to as diarrhoeal disease ."
"our diagnosis , then , is in the tirst instance largely based on the mother ' s history .","dysentery , much less often used , has a more variable meaning and further clarification is always sought ."
firstly we have looked at possible sources and routes of transmission using water and food bacteriology studies .,secondly we have tried to identify a causal agent using stool microbiology .

"although there is a tendency for adults to observe three meal - times per day , feeding of small children is particularly haphazard , never more so than during the rains , when considerable time and effort is diverted towards farming activities .","at such times small children and infants may be left in the compounds in the care of young "" nursemaids "" with a supply of porridge or gruel for the next eight to nine hours , and food from the evening meal is sometimes stored overnight ."
"however , after minutes , bacillus coypus which was present in two - thirds of the samples reaches unacceptable levels ( lo5 to lo7 organisms per g of food ) which are known to be associated with gastro - intestinal symptoms ( thatcher & clark , ) .",the bacteriological results indicate that freshly cooked food is generally of acceptable quality .

"unconjugates may be found in the presence of bacterial colonization of the gut , as may disturbances in the total and individual bile salt concentrations .",normally these bile salts are conjugated to one or other of the two amino - acids glycine and taurine .
this is identical to the pattern seen in ileal resections and in this situation is likely to be due to malabsorption of the taurine conjugates .,normally dihydroxy bile salts account for % of the total bile salts present .
"furthermore , two cytopathic agents , designated as bhm26 and bj50 , were isolated from the bovine diarrheic fecal samples .","during passage in ma104 cells , ultrathin sections of virus - infected monolayers were examined using a transmission electron microscope , and a large number of symmetrical virus crystals were seen in the cytoplasm , with monomorphic small viral particles of - 30 nm in diameter ."
"hydrated native particles are - 30 nm in diameter in electron micrographs , which reveal the virion to be a smooth sphere .","bev virions consist of a naked capsid that surrounds a core of positive - sense , single - stranded rna ."
"these viruses were characterized molecularly through sequence analysis of complete genomes , and the bhm26 and bj50 isolates were therefore classified into genotype of the bev - b cluster .","also , the present report described the first isolation , by means of ma104 cell cultures , of two isolates of bev ( designated bhm26 and bj50 ) obtained from rectal swabs from diarrheic cattle of dairy herds in china ."
a total of fecal samples were collected from cattle at six farms in china from october to july .,"out of a total of fecal samples , were from animals with diarrhea and were from non - diarrheic animals ."
"when cytopathic effect ( cpe ) was not observed one week after inoculation , or the cells showed to % cpe , the cultures were frozen and thawed three times for harvest of cell lysates .","after adsorption for min at c , ml of fresh medium ( without fbs ) was added , the cultures were incubated at c in a co incubator ."
"all of the pcr products were detected by electrophoresis in % agarose gels and were purified using a dna gel extraction kit ( watson biotechnologies , inc . , shanghai , china ) .","sequences at the end of the virus genomes were determined using rt - pcr , with first - strand cdna synthesis carried out using an oligo ( dt ) primer , thus taking advantage of the poly ( a ) tail in bev rna genomes as a priming site ."
amino acid sequences were deduced from the nucleotide sequences using the editseq module .,"multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor - joining method using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis ( mega , version ) software , and bootstrap resampling analysis of replicates was performed ."

"in this study , bev - specific rna not only was detected in diarrheic faecal samples ( 14 of bev - positive samples collected from diarrheic cattle ) but also was detected in healthy faecal samples ( 3 of bev - positive samples collected from healthy cattle ) .","at the same time , two other rna viruses that are transmitted by the fecal - oral route ( bovine coronavirus and rotavirus ) were detected from diarrheic faecal samples ."
engineering of recombinant bevs displaying the fmdv neutralizing epitope in our laboratory is underway for development of a bev - vectored and epitopebased vaccine .,our previous studies have finely mapped a conserved type o fmdv neutralizing epitope recognized by a specific monoclonal antibody .
a high proportion of these deaths occur within the first week of life .,"in south america , cria mortality rates before weaning may reach %, mostly caused by clostridium perfringens ( types a and c ) ."
"more than % of fetal growth occurs in the last trimester of pregnancy , and the normal rate and growth pattern of the fetus may be altered by numerous factors , including abnormal hormonal environment , nutrition , genetics , and infectious conditions .",care of the neonate begins during the long gestation as strength and viability of the newborn is greatly influenced by health of the dam .
a clear emergency protocol and communication channel should be established between the breeder and the attending veterinarian .,it is preferable not to change the social organization of the periparturient female or move it during the first stage of labor .
"if an intrauterine infection exists , the fetus may be born alive or may die in utero .",intrauterine infections of bacterial origin in the newborn camelid are recognized more commonly compared with viral infections .
"however , the cria should be monitored from a distance during the period of adjustment to its new environment .",human intervention on the newborn should be as limited as possible to avoid disturbing the establishment of the dam - cria bond .
"assessment of the newborn cria includes evaluation of the epidermal membrane , respiration , heart function , and presence of obvious congenital abnormalities .",physical and behavioral parameters of the normal newborn camelid are presented in table .
"the mother - cria bond is established through humming , nose - to - nose touching , and nuzzling of the cria .",the dam ' s udder could be cleaned with a warm wet towel and the teats examined for any abnormalities and stripped to unplug them .
cattle colostrum is the second best choice for supplementation in crias .,"it is important that the source of noncamelid colostrum be free from major infectious diseases ( i . e . , bovine viral diarrhea virus [ bvdv ] , johne disease , brucellosis , etc . ) ."
"however , it is important to realize that the igg concentration drops abruptly after the first two milkings .",it is highly recommended that alpaca and llama breeding operations be prepared for a possible need for colostrum supplementation by having a stock of frozen caprine or bovine colostrum .
the tube should be felt by palpation as it goes down the left side of the neck .,care should be taken not to place the tube in the respiratory tract ( trachea ) .
"conversely , successful immunoglobulin transfer is associated with low infection rates and the high likelihood of survival .","even though this is true , great differences exist among farms with regard to immunoglobulin concentrations in healthy neonates ."
agalactia or poor mammary gland development is frequently seen in young females or following hormonal treatment during pregnancy .,dam factors include primary causes such as poor colostrogenesis or secondary causes such as painful conditions or stress preventing intake by the cria .
it has become a standard practice in north america to test all newborn sacs for bvdv ( polymerase chain reaction [ pcr ] test ) for early identification of persistently infected ( pi ) crias so that they can be separated from the herd .,"if local conditions justify , a dose of international units ( iu ) of d per kilogram of body weight subcutaneously has been suggested for crias in late autumn and again in midwinter and to adult females in midwinter to prevent vitamin d inadequacy ."
"factors for high risk in neonates include dams with previous problems , prematurity , dystocia , prolonged obstetric manipulations , delivery by cesarean section , placentitis , premature placental separation , and prolonged pregnancy .","early identification and intensive care of at - risk crias is very important , as many will develop failure of passive transfer and septicemia ."
"the coat appears silky , and the limbs are overextended at the carpus and fetlock because of laxity of tendon and poor muscle tone .","the incisors are not erupted , and a lack of or poor suckling reflex is seen ( figure - 3 ) ."
these neonates usually are presented with similar biophysical characteristics as the premature neonates except that they may have normal body development .,excessively long gestation ( > 370 days ) has been associated with increased risk for dysmaturity and neonatal deaths in the first days of life in our eerience .
"since the srid is species specific , it will not be accurate , if colostrum other than that of camelids was used .","using triple j plates ( triple j farms , bellingham wa ) levels greater than mg / dl are considered adequate , and levels less than mg / dl are considered an indication of failure of passive transfer ."
the most common infections of newborn camelids in the first few days of life are clostridial diseases caused by escherichia coli and coronavirus .,clostridiosis caused by clostridium perfringens type a has been reported to cause severe losses among some populations of crias .
"this strategy has been reported to be effective in controlling coronavirus outbreaks , probably because of the close genetic relationship between the strains isolated from alpacas and those from cattle .","recently , alpaca breeders have been giving bovine modified live vaccines against coronavirus orally in the first hours of life ."
crias may be orphaned or simply may require hand raising because of lack of milk production or very rarely dam rejection .,goat or cow milk has been used effectively as a replacement .
many congenital abnormalities have been described in alpacas and llamas and seem to occur more frequently in these species than in other domestic animals ( table - 3 ) .,"the most common and potentially lethal congenital abnormalities that affect camelid neonates are choanal atresia , atresia ani or coli , atresia vulvi , severe heart defects , and severe urinary system abnormalities ."
small umbilical hernias ( less than cm ) tend to resolve spontaneously with advancing age .,larger hernias should be corrected surgically if they do not respond well to management with bandage to avoid any complications .
congenital diaphragmatic hernias may cause sudden death or severe respiratory distress immediately after birth .,"we have seen several cases of abnormalities of the respiratory system or diaphragmatic hernias that have been mistakenly "" diagnosed "" by the owner as choanal atresia ."
"other more severe defects that have been described include auricular septal defect , tof , transposition of the great vessels , persistent right aortic arch , and patent ductus arteriosus .",the most common heart defect in alpacas and llamas is vsd .
"surgical correction of choanal atresia has been attempted , but euthanasia should be considered because of the high rate of complications and their effects on quality of life .","maxillofacial agenesis or dysgenesis ( "" wry face "" ) may be associated with choanal atresia as part of a complex genetic disorder ( figure - 4 ) ."
supernumerary teats may be associated with functional glandular tissue ( figure - 8 ) .,congenital abnormalities of the mammary gland are abnormal conformation of the teat ( partial separation ) and supernumerary teats ( polythelia ) .
omphalophlebitis may develop later in life in crias that were born in unsanitary conditions or had a failure of passive transfer .,patent urachus may be observed but is less common than in other species .
multiple soapy water enemas may irritate the rectal mucosa and result in severe straining and rectal prolapse .,"various preparations , including magnesium sulfate , human phosphate preparations , and acetylcysteinecontaining preparations , have been used ."
"abnormal teat conformation , which is common , may compromise the ability of the cria to feed .",absence of teats ( athelia ) has been described in up to % of alpacas .
the physiology of lactation has been investigated in few studies on milk production and milk characteristics particularly .,initial milk production has been estimated at about ml in alpacas and ml in llamas .
resuscitation of the compromised cria requires a warm environment and treatment of failure of passive transfer and dehydration .,hypothermia and depression may also be seen in crias with severe blood loss from the umbilicus or rupture .
"mammary gland function and lactation remain poorly studied in alpacas and llamas , and reports in the english literature are scarce .","however , some information is available on the anatomy of the mammary gland and milk production and characteristics ."
"overall mean fat content in milk was and for the ahp and p regions , respectively .",fat content was lower in both colostrum and milk in the p region compared with those in the ahp region .
the effects of lactation on the body condition score ( bcs ) and blood biochemistry of the dam have been studied in alpacas .,"under south american grazing conditions , weight and bcs do not seem to be greatly affected by lactation ."
"we utilized highly sensitive pcr assays to evaluate respiratory secretions of healthy adults after screening carefully to insure they did not have immune deficiencies , symptoms of upper respiratory infection ( uri ) , or symptoms that could represent a misinterpreted uri .","furthermore , the data describing the detection of respiratoryviruses from "" asymptomatic "" individuals often fail to define "" asymptomatic "" or simply report studies from convenient hospital populations without respiratory diagnoses ."
healthy volunteers were carefully screened to meet strict entry criteria ( table ) so as to avoid enrolling subjects into viral therapeutic studies who inadvertently were infected with respiratory viruses .,a nasal wash was obtained which was frozen on dry ice and stored at c until batch testing using fda - approved pcr assays with low detection thresholds .
this differs from respiratory - viruses in infants which as evidenced by rsv pcr data can persist much longer ( > month ) .,"it appears viral infections causing respiratory symptoms are either eradicated or drop below sensitive detection thresholds within this - week time frame [ 3 , , ."
"although these selection criteria may have reduced the recent eure of our subjects to respiratory - viruses , their susceptibility and likelihood of becoming symptomatic with these infections likely reflects that of the general healthy population .",these data may therefore underrepresent the true number of asymptomatic detection in the general population .
"any significant acute or chronic , uncontrolled medical illness associated with increased risk of complications of respiratory viral illness .","systemic glucocorticoids , antiviral drugs , and immunoglobulins , or any other cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drug within months prior to dosing ; receipt of any systemic chemotherapy agent at any time ."
"respiratory disease is a multifactorial disease , caused by a variety of aetiological agents .",environmental and husbandry factors and impaired resistance of predisposed calves to the infections are involved .
calves ( n = ) presented mild to moderate signs of respiratory disease .,"secondary bacterial infections , pasteurella multocida and mycoplasma dispar as major species , were detected in tracheobronchial lavage samples ."
"in addition , calves were retrospectively divided into two groups based on brsv - specific igg production ( high and low ) , and different patterns of app concentration changes were compared to elore host response differences between these groups .","the objective of this study was to investigate changes of four bovine apps , saa , lipopolysaccharide binding protein ( lbp ) , hp and agp during an outbreak of brd in young dairy calves ."
"elisa kits ( svanova biotech , uppsala , sweden ) were used to detect igg antibodies specific to brsv , parainfluenza virus ( piv - 3 ) and bcv from serum samples according to the manufacturer ' s instructions .",samples that generated a corrected optical density ( cod ) value of ! 0.2 at nm were regarded as positive .
"ramp time was - 10 s for h at v / cm , and the temperature was c .","fragments were separated in % seakem gold agarose ( cambrex , rockland , me , usa ) in tbe by using a chef - dr iii system ( bio - rad , richmond , ca , usa ) ."
firstorder autoregressive correlation structure ( ar1 ) was used for modelling serial correlations of repeated measurements within calves .,plots of empirical autocorrelation function of the normalized residuals were used to elore adequacy of the ar1 correlation matrix .
brsv was found in five calves in the - week tbl samples ( table ) but not in - week tbl samples .,no bcv was found in any of the tbl samples investigated .
the only calf with no p . multocida infection at week had an increase of saa and lbp concentrations from week to ( from to mg / l and from to mg / l respectively ) .,"p . multocida was isolated from nine and six calves in the first and second samplings , respectively , and at least once from every calf ( table ) ."
"mean lbp concentrations decreased between weeks and ( p < 5 ) and increased between weeks and ( p < 01 ) in low antibody group compared with the high - response group , where the mean concentrations increased and decreased , respectively .","mean saa concentration increased in the low antibody group between weeks and ( p < 01 ) compared with the high antibody group , where the mean concentration decreased ."
"four days before the week sampling , one older calf was brought back from the veterinary clinic after receiving operation on an umbilical hernia .",this calf showed clinical signs of brd on arrival and was treated with antibiotics .
"the first inflammatory reaction , reflected as an increase in saa and lbp concentrations at week , is probably a response to the brs virus .","increased values of sensitive apps ( saa and lbp ) on weeks and , and the highest concentrations of hp on week also emphasize the two - stage nature of the inflammatory response ."
"we genotyped all isolates with sali restriction analysis , which efficiently differentiates between p . multocida strains from the bovine respiratory tract ( t . pohjanvirta , personal communication ) .","all isolates had an identical sali banding pattern , indicating that one infective strain had persisted throughout the study ."
"however , calves from both groups had similar saa , lbp and clinical responses at week , and brs virus findings at week were comparable ( 2 from lowresponse and from high - response groups ; table ) .","there was a similar distribution of antibody response groups calves between the two fences , and one nipple of the automatic feeder in the fence possibly assisted the quick spread of the virus ."
"generally , concentrations of saa , lbp and agp were at the highest during the first weeks of life , decreased afterwards and then stabilized around at - 4 weeks .","in our previous study , where we used calves from the same farm in exactly the same conditions , we show how age affects concentrations of apps ."
"in the same time , parallel measuring of the hp response can be valuable to improve the evaluation of the severity of inflammation .","an early increase in response to viral infection and a marked rise in the secondary bacterial infection even when only mild or moderate clinical signs of brd are present , make saa and lbp the best candidates for this purpose ."
we also believed - compared to other theoretical frameworks - that the functional tanomy of mers can provide a more useful unifying framework to elore how mers of biological phenomena can .,in what ways does your research involve the use of multiple representations in biology teaching and learning ?
"- using analogies , metaphors , visualizations , language , and others - at the macro , micro / submicro and / or symbolic levels - along hierarchically organized levels from molecules to the biosphere .","what pedagogical functions of multiple external representations in biology does your research show that can enhance teaching and learning biological concepts ( i . e . , in helping students construct their mental models or internal representations of such concepts ) ?"
"useful representations always have embedded information that requires learners to engage in deep thinking about the represented knowledge , often in collaboration with others , for deeper understanding .","the themes are generally in line with the view that learning with external representations ( a cognitive science perspective ) and constructivist learning ( a science education perspective ) have a primary commonality in terms of agency ( mckendree , small , stenning , & conlon , ) or a sense of empowerment that is an important part of scientific literacy ( anderson , ) ."
"visual representations are now considered to be very important in learning and teaching with models and modeling in science education ( e . g . , gilbert , reiner , & nakhleh , ) .","further , learning how to visually represent ideas is important for students in learning science as illustrated by ainsworth , prain , and tytler who asserted that drawing as an activity plays an important role in students learning science - to engage in science learning , to learn to represent science , to reason in science , to use it as strategy for learning science , and to communicate ideas in science ."
"these mers include hypermedia - based conceptual representations that foster learners ' coconstruction of biological knowledge ( liu and hmelo - silver ) ; complex process diagrams for premedical students ' understanding of the complex concepts of molecular biology ( griffard ) , dynamically linked mers in biologica that help students develop reasoning in genetics ( buckley and quellmalz ; tsui and treagust ) , animations that promote student comprehension of biotechnological methods ( yarden and yarden ) , and interactive computer videogames that enable th grade students to develop deep understanding of the concepts underlying the theory of evolution by natural selection ( horwitz ) .",many of the chapter authors have shown that using a variety of representations can help students construct a deeper conceptual understanding of biology .
"several chapters focus on the skills of reading and interpreting visualizations : static visualization skills for reading textbook diagrams ( eilam ) , dynamic visualization skills for simulation - based representations ( yarden and yarden ; buckley and quellmalz ) , and reading pictures and other inscriptions from vygotsky ' s sociocultural perspectives ( roth and pozzer - ardenghi ) .",three other chapters focus on competence for translating across representations of biological structures and functions ( sch nborn and b geholz ; schwartz and brown ; and srivastava and ramadas ) .
"representational competence , as halverson and friedrichen ' s chapter points out , is domain - specific and can have as many as seven levels .","for example , in their chapter , the representational competence is about reading and building phylogenetic trees in a novice - eert continuum in terms of seven levels - no use , superficial use , simplified use , symbolic use , conceptual use , scientific use , and eert use ."
we believe that these warrant further discussion in synthesizing the themes of the chapters and in drawing conclusions for this volume .,there are several groups of mers for biological knowledge suggested by some chapter authors that appear to be increasingly important for biology teaching and biology teacher education in the twenty - first century .
"therefore , such human - centered thinking might justify the eloitation of nature by and for humankind , as well as possibly mask the social and political dimensions behind the biology - based societal problems ( e . g . , bell & russell , ) .","as bonnett notes , nature is "" seen essentially as a resource , an object to be intellectually possessed and physically manipulated and eloited in whatever ways are perceived to suit ( someone ' s version of ) human needs and wants "" ( p . ) ."
"multiple external representations ( mers ) are relevant to improving school biology in that this notion can be used to address the perennial critique of the deficit in the interconnectedness of knowledge in school biology curricula ( buckley and quellmalz ) and shortfalls in the systemic transfer of knowledge across multiple levels of biological organization ( e . g . , sch nborn & b geholz , ; sch nborn & b geholz ' s chapter ) .","some other chapter authors also take a systems view of the interconnectedness that focuses on one of the unifying themes in living systems : evolution of organisms from simple to complex forms ( halverson and friedrichsen ) , information transfer from dna to subcellular organelles through a hierarchically organized biological structures to the whole organisms ( buckley and quellmalz ; tsui and treagust ) , and energy transfer from the sun to producers , consumers , and decomposers through the hierarchically organized ecosystems ( schwartz and brown ) ."
on the importance of models and modeling activities to develop students ' systems thinking and related systems concepts in secondary schools .,addressing this issue is the study reported by verhoeff et al .
roth and pozzer - ardenghi discuss reading pictures as a social practice from anthropological and socialpsychological perspectives .,cl ment and cast ra examine genetic determinism in textbooks from countries .
"their research in this area over years has been conducted in north america , brazil , and korea .","for example , their high school textbook analysis indicated that pictures or photographs are a useful resource in forming a link between scientific inscriptions such as a table , graph , or formula , and students ' everyday eerience but that additional scaffolding is needed for more effective learning ."
chinese officials initially covered up the truths about sars for political reasons by censoring reports in the media about this mysterious disease to avoid public fear and instability during the leadership change in the ruling communist party .,"sars cases continued to increase for months in early and spread to beijing ( abraham , ; loh , ) ."
"consequently , we believe that representations of biological knowledge must be interpreted within a broader context related to the surrounding cultures and the societal or political factors in order to construct a deeper understanding of nature of science .","these three chapters remind biology teachers and biology teacher educators that the external representations of phenomena in biological research , and education may be compromised by philosophical , cultural , social , and political factors that are often overlooked ."
"the authors themselves and the participants in their studies are well represented in terms of the three concentric circles in kachru ' s ( as citied in martin & siry , ) model of world englishes .",many chapter authors in this volume have languages other than english as their first language .
"whereas many english language learners ( ells ) in us schools are learning biology in english ( their l2 ) ( macswan & rolstad , ) , secondary students in germany and other countries within the european union are also increasingly using english ( their l2 ) for learning content subjects ( wannagat , ) .","this volume reminds readers that many of today ' s students are learning biology in languages other than english and the authors ' studies also involved the use of other languages for learning and teaching biology - for example , german , french , indian ( marathi and hindi ) , hebrew , dutch , arabic , portuguese , chinese ( cantonese ) , and korean ."
"as such , bilingual representations of biological knowledge can be useful to serve one or more pedagogical functions of mers .","professional development of biology teachers for developing their proficiency in both students ' l1 and l2 is also important for effective teaching using the bilingual approach ( wannagat , ) ."
"examples of assessment include the use of hypermedia for assessing learning about human body systems ( liu and hmelo - silver ) , online reflective journal entries for assessing learning of evolutionary tree thinking ( halverson and friedrichsen ) , clinical interviews and paper - andpencil tests to assess learning about complex processes diagrams of molecular biology in university textbooks ( griffard ) , and analysis of pictures in textbooks and gestures in lectures ( roth & pozzer - ardenghi ) .","the chapter authors in this volume have illustrated how learning and teaching with mers in biology need to be critically examined and assessed , particularly at the university level , so that instructors and professors , as well as undergraduate and graduate students including student teachers , can more effectively understand and use multiple representations in their teaching ."
"to assess learning in computer - based learning environments , online assessments of outcomes are usually used .","as illustrated in this volume , to evaluate student understanding of genetics from the multi - representational learning environment biologica , online pretests and posttests were used to evaluate student understanding in terms of six types of genetics reasoning ( tsui and treagust ) ."
"besides conventional eerimental research designs , the more useful methods appear to be computer modeling , case studies , ethnographic studies , and microgenetic studies ( ainsworth , ) .",our review indicates that the variety of methodologies reported in the chapters for assessing student learning and evaluating student understanding have rightly pointed in this direction .
"we believe that this goal is also part of the challenge for teachers and students at all levels to , respectively , teach and learn biology with multiple representations .","as illustrated by the chapters in this volume , visualization skills , reasoning skills , tree building skills , representational competence , and systems thinking skills all appear to be useful , and even crucial , for learning biology in the twenty - first century from the wide variety of multiple representations in biology textbooks , online resources , and school lessons or university lectures ."
"new biologists also need to have "" deep knowledge in one discipline and a ' working fluency ' in several "" ( p . ) .",", the new biology in the twenty - first century involves complex interdisciplinary problems that will require biologists to incorporate "" emerging theory , new technologies , fundamental findings from basic research in the life sciences "" and to integrate into biology "" physical sciences , mathematics , and engineering [ that ] could enable biology to contribute to rapid progress in practical problem - solving "" ( p . ) ."
"while gratefully acknowledging the excellent contributions of the chapter authors from around the world to multiple representations in biological education , we must say that it has been a great privilege for us to edit their chapters and that our many e - mail communications and interactions are very useful .","we are grateful to john gilbert , bernadette ohmer , shaaron ainsworth , kathleen fisher , anat yarden , and kristy halverson who have provided us valuable advice and help in one way or another in completing this volume ."
we believe that multiple representations in biological education can make a small contribution in this direction .,we also hope that this collection of research reports and theoretical eitions in the area of multiple representations can encourage more studies in this direction so that biology educators can better harness the resources in the repertoire of multiple external representations ( mers ) for improving biological education .

"adverse events for which observations were made included ruffling of fur , lethargy , paralysis , incontinence , repetitive circular motion , and aggression .","five mice were used per treatment group ; with weights taken prior to the start of treatment , and the animals were observed for overt signs of toxicity and death for days ."
"lungs were scored based on surface appearance ( gross pathology , hemorrhage ) of lungs .","lungs were assigned a score ranging from to , with indicating that the lungs looked normal and denoting that the entire surface area of the lung was inflamed and showed plum colored lung discoloration ( sidwell et al . , ) ."
the titers ( ccid values ) were calculated using the reed - muench method .,"the various dilutions of the supernatant fluids were assayed in triplicate for infectious virus in mdck cells by cpe assay , as described previously ."
"hazard ratios , which compare how rapidly groups of treated mice die relative to untreated control groups of mice , were determined by the mantel - haenszel tests as part of the survival analysis program used above ( graphpad prism for mac v5 ) .","when significant differences among the treatment groups were observed , pairwise comparisons of survivor curves ( placebo vs . any treatment ) were analyzed by the gehan - breslow - wilcon test ( graphpad prism for mac v5 ) , and the relative significance was adjusted to a bonferroni - corrected significance threshold for the number of treatment comparisons done ( bland , ) ."
"we first examined the effect of ' fdc and ' - deoxy - 5 - fluorocytidine ( 5 ' - fdc ) ( figure ) , two of the compounds shown to inhibit other rna viruses , for inhibition of replication of various avian h5n1 influenza viruses in mdck cells at c .",' - fdc most potently inhibited the hong kong / 213 / 2003 ( h5n1 ) virus with ic values of 5 m by visual assay with an ic50 value of 7 m by neutral red uptake assay ( table ) .
"' - azido - 2 ' - deoxyctidine - 5 ' - triphosphate ( figure ) was also evaluated to see if the azide group contributed significantly to the antiviral effect seen previously and because ' azidocytidine analogs have been shown to inhibit hepatitis c virus ( smith et al . , ) .",we further examined the effects of other fluorodeoxyribonucleosides for inhibition of h5n1 influenza virus replication to see how important the nucleoside was for inhibiting virus replication ( table ) .
"the ic values for the h3n2 and h1n1 viruses tested were in the range of - 6.8 m and for the hybrid h1n1 viruses eressing the h5n1 ha and na proteins , - 5.1 m .",ic values ranged from 9 m for the thailand / 2 ( kan1 ) / 16/2004 h5n1 strain ( table ) ( table ) .
"gemcitabine ( 2 ' - deoxy - 2 ' , ' - difluorocytidine , figure ) in some assays , some toxicity was detected with cc values ranging from to m by visual assay and from to m by neutral up take assay .","nevertheless , the inhibitory activity for most viruses was overall very selective when cytotoxicity was not a factor with si values ranging from to > 3100 ."
% of the mice survived the infection when treated with mg / kg / d of ' - fdc .,at this higher dose little toxicity was observed with the exception of a tendency of a little more weight loss ( data not shown ) .
"in addition , adding another fluoro group to the ' position of the sugar to get ' - deoxy - 2 ' , ' - difluorocytidine ( gemcitabine ) also greatly enhanced the potency against the influenza viruses ( table ) , although in some assays gemcitabine was cytotoxic .","thus , evaluation of - fdc and gemcitabine was carried out by infecting groups of mice i . n ."
"using a similar treatment regimen , a maximum tolerated dose study was done with gemcitabine in on the suspicion that doses similar to those doses used for ' - fdc would be toxic as was shown for - fdc .","indeed , the data from that study suggested that only a dose below mg / kg / d could be used without the mice quickly succumbing to death ( data not shown ) ."
"finally , ' - fdc was evaluated against a pandemic h1n1 influenza a virus from to determine if ' - fdc was as also a broad - spectrum inhibitor of influenza viruses in vivo as it was in vitro .","using the same dosing regimen as described for the initial evaluation of ' - fdc for efficacy against h5n1 a / vietnam / 1203 / 2004 virus , ' - fdc was administered to mice h before virus eure at , , and mg / kg / d ( bid ) ( fig ."
"based on the efficacy data from cef cells , the investigators reporting the earlier study chose to pursue the ' - deoxy - 2 ' fluoroguanosine ribonucleoside for animal testing .","both compounds were found to be equally inhibitory of influenza virus replication in human tracheal cultures jakeman et al . , ) ."
"because ' - fdc may assume a - endo conformation and thus act as a ribonucleoside , ' - fdc may actually act as a substrate for the influenza rna polymerase complex .","it has been suggested that ' - fluorodeoxyribonucleosides may very well act as ribonucleosides , since it has been confirmed that both - deoxy - 2 - fluororibonucleosides and - ribonucleosides adopt a - endo conformation ( blandin et al . , ) ."
"the lack of protection and toxicity at high doses of ' fdc may be due to inhibition of host dna polymerases ( richardson et al . , ) .","in addition , other cytidine analogs such as the closely related gemcitabine ( 2 ' , 2 ' - difluorodeoxycytidine ) have been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase ( shao et al . , ) and cytidine synthetase ( heinemann et al . , ) , the inhibition of which may also be mechanisms for inhibiting influenza virus infections ."
"using ' - fdc at mg / kg / d was nearly as effective as the higher dose of ' fdc , but neither dose reduced virus lung titers comparable to those virus titers from lungs of mice treated with ribavirin .","this could suggest that immunomodulation , as discussed above , may have contributed to the efficacy of ' - fdc in facilitating the survival of influenza - infected mice ."
"finally , similar efficacy against influenza a virus h1n1 - infected mice treated with ' fdc at mg / kg / d twice a day for days was achieved as was attained for mice infected with h5n1 highly pathogenic avian influenza a virus in mice using the same dose and treatment regimen .","however , this treatment of influenza a virus h1n1 - infected mice with ' fdc at mg / kg / d twice a day for days was not as effective as the treatment of influenza a h1n1infected with ribavirin at mg / kg / d using the same treatment regimen ."
"these studies support our hypothesis that cytidine nucleoside analogs , in particular , cytidine deoxyribonucleosides might represent good platforms from which to develop potent inhibitors of rna viruses , including influenza viruses .","thus , our study might provide the basis for the development of additional potent and clinically useful inhibitors for use as antiinfluenza agents , including highly pathogenic avian influenza a h5n1 viruses ."
"ifn - l4 most closely resembles ifn - l3 , but these proteins share only % amino - acid identity , and , in contrast to ifn - l3 , ifn - l4 is only weakly secreted .","the ancestral ifnl4 - dg allele is the major variant in africans while the minor variant in asians , suggesting very strong negative genetic selection for this allelemost likely driven by an infectious agent other than hcv ."
"here , we summarize the current knowledge of ifn - l4 and discuss questions that should be addressed to resolve its paradoxical biologic activities .","it appears , therefore , that ifn - l4 impairs hcv clearance by an as - yet - undefined mechanism ."
"those changes are consistent with the widespread recognition that these cytokines function primarily as ifns , not as interleukins .","the proteins encoded by these genes , ifn - l1 , ifn - l2 and ifn - l3 , are highly similar to each other ."
"ifns induce antiviral activity in cells that eress the corresponding cell surface receptors , and ifn - lr1 eression is largely restricted to cells of epithelial origin ( sommereyns and others ; mordstein and others ) .","these cytokines signal through a heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of ifn - lr1 , the ligand - binding chain , and il - 1 0 r2 , the accessory chain ( kotenko and others ; sheppard and others ; donnelly and kotenko ) ."
"the genes induced by type iii ifns appear to be essentially the same as those induced by ifn - a ( doyle and others ; marcello and others ) , and the downstream biological activities induced by either group appear to be very similar .",the proteins encoded by these isgs mediate a variety of antiviral and anti - proliferative activities .
"in addition to their ability to activate the jak / stat signaling pathway , the ifn - lambda subtypes ( ie , ifn - l1 , and ) can also induce the activation of other signaling pathways , including p38 mitogen - activated protein ( map ) kinase and c - jun n - terminal kinase ( jnk ) , in certain cell types ( zhou and others ) .","in addition , it was reported that signaling by ifn - l1 through the canonical ifn - lr1 / il - 1 0 r2 receptor complex results in the activation of p90 ribosomal protein s6 kinase ( rsk1 ) and its downstream effector , eukaryotic initiation factor b ( eif4b ) , in several tumor cell lines , including a human colon carcinoma ( ht - 29 ) and a human retinal epithelial cell line ( arpe - 19 ) ( kroczynska and others ) ."
"furthermore , treatment with type - iii ifn ( ifn - l ) but not type - i ifn ( ifn - a ) protected wild - type mice against rotavirus infection .","these findings indicate that type iii ifn , but not type i ifn , plays a more dominant role in host defense against certain types of viral infections ."
"specifically , a genotype for the rs12979860 snp ( located * 3 kb upstream of ifnl3 ) was reported to be the host factor that was most strongly associated with a response to pegylated ifn - a and ribavirin treatment for hcv - infected patients ( thompson and others ) .","individuals who carried the rs12979860 - t allele ( ie , c / t and t / t genotypes ) were less likely to respond to treatment than those with copies of the rs12979860 - c allele ."
"in addition , rs12979860 - t , as well as the strongly linked rs8099917 - g allele , was shown to be associated with higher intrahepatic eression of isgs before treatment ( honda and others ; urban and others ) .","thus , the range of phenotypes associated with the rs12979860 - t allele was paradoxical , because it encompassed decreased treatment - induced viral clearance in the face of higher isg eression levels and lower hcv rna levels before treatment ."
"a nonsynonymous coding variant in ifnl3 ( rs8103142 , arg70 - lys ) that is in strong ld with rs12979860 does not appear to alter the potency or function of ifn - l3 ( urban and others ) .","recently , mcfarland and others suggested that the rs4803217 polymorphism , which lies in the untranslated region of ifnl3 and is in strong ld with rs12979860 , is a functional variant which affects the stability of ifnl3 transcripts by influencing adenosine - uridine - rich elementmediated decay of ifnl3 mrna and the binding of hcvinduced micrornas during infection ."
"however , we found that , among africans , ld between ifnl4 - dg and ifnl4 rs12979860 - t is weaker than in other populations ( r * 0.7 ) .",this enabled us to demonstrate that hcv rna decline after days of treatment with pegylated ifn - a and ribavirin was more strongly associated with a genotype for ifnl4 - dg than ifnl4 rs12979860 among african american patients who had enrolled in the virahep study ( fig .
"a number of host factors have been shown to predict response to treatment for chronic hepatitis c . previously , thompson and his colleagues showed that among such factors , ifnl4 rs12979860 genotype was the strongest factor for response to treatment with pegylated ifn - a and ribavirin ( thompson and others ) .","by extrapolation , the new data suggest that ifnl4 - dg genotype may be the single strongest host factor for predicting such a treatment response ."
"despite this sequence dissimilarity , based on structural modeling studies , hamming and others concluded that the overall structure of ifn - l4 is similar to that of ifn - l1 , , and , and independent work from groups now indicates that ifn - l4 can signal through the ifn - l receptor complex .","ifn - l4 is very distinct from ifn - l1 , , and in the d helix , which is the predicted binding region for the il - 1 0 r2 chain , the second chain of the ifn - l receptor complex ( prokunina - olsson and others ) ."
"furthermore , despite the structural differences between ifn - l4 and ifn - l3 noted earlier , these investigators also showed that the levels of isg induction and anti - viral activity are similar for ifn - l4 and ifn - l3 ( hamming and others ) .","the antiviral potency of ifn - l4 was found to be quite similar to that of ifn - l3 when tested on different hepatic cell lines , huh7 and hepg2 ."
"the transcript that includes ifnl4 - dg and produces full - length ifn - l4 protein ( designated jn806234 or nm_001276254 ) is very similar to transcript jn806227 , which produces a prematurely terminated protein due to the presence of the ifnl4 - tt allele and the resulting frameshift ( prokunina - olsson and others ) .","due to the location of the defining ifnl4 - dg / tt polymorphism in the first en of ifnl4 and the splicing composition of the ifnl4 region , transcripts are eressed after induction , but only of these generates the full - length ifn - l4 protein ( prokunina - olsson and others ) ."
"using the former approach , amanzada and others analyzed mrna eression in the ifnl4 region from liver biopsy specimens of patients with chronic hepatitis c , chronic hepatitis b , or nonviral liver diseases , as well as patients without liver disease .","these investigators found ifnl4 region transcripts to be present in * 50% of the liver specimens from patients with hcv infection , but none of the specimens from patients with other liver diseases or normal liver ."
"these investigators also found that hepatic eression of isgs ( isg15 and usp18 ) was higher in the ifnl4 - dg carriers and that , among ifnl4 - dg carriers , isg levels were positively correlated with ifnl4 - dg eression levels .","among the recipients who carried ifnl4 - dg , hepatic eression of ifnl4 - dg mrna was significantly lower in patients who achieved svr compared with those who did not ; whereas among the recipients with the ifnl4 - tt / tt genotype , treatment response did not differ by ifnl4 - tt mrna levels ."
some recent studies have examined the potential cross - regulatory effects of ifn - l on ifn - a responsiveness .,"as noted earlier , these individuals have higher basal levels of isg eression despite being less likely to respond efficiently to pegylated ifn - a and ribavirin therapy ."
"cells from donors who carried ifnl4 - dg were infected at higher frequencies , and the antiviral program in infected cells from such donors was less robust than in infected cells from donors with the ifnl4 - tt / tt genotype .",these results suggest that ifn - l4 may impair the antiviral program required for effective hcv clearance ( sheahan and others ) .
"if ifn - l4 is not efficiently secreted , this protein could conceivably become extracellular within the liver as a result of cell lysis .","notably , this appears to be the case for at least one of the type i ifns , ifn - k ( buontempo and others ) ."
"full - length protein - coding ifnl4 transcripts were initially predicted only in humans and other primates ( prokunina - olsson and others ); however , an additional genomic analysis has identified ifnl4 in a number of nonprimate mammals , although not in mice and rats ( tang and others ) .","except for humans , all species with available ifnl4 genomic sequence have been found to be monomorphic for the ifnl4 - dg allele that supports the ifn - l4 open reading frame ( tang and others ) ."
"furthermore , hcv usually causes a slowly progressive chronic infection that is unlikely to markedly impair reproduction .","infection with hcv is now relatively common worldwide ( shepard and others ) ; however , risk factors that account for the bulk of hcv transmission ( blood transfusions , contaminated medical injections , and injection drug use ) arose primarily in the twentieth century ."
"griffiths and others found that individuals with the ct or tt genotypes for ifnl4 rs12979860 ( ie , likely ifnl4 - dg carriers ) had more frequent episodes of severe herpes labialis ( griffiths and others ) , a condition resulting from reactivation of herpes simplex virus type .","to date , gwas for other infectious diseases have not reported associations with variants in the ifn - l region ."
"both ifn - l4 and ifn - l3 signal through ifn - l receptor complex , activate the jak - stat pathway to induce isgs , and exhibit strong antiviral activity in vitro .","on the other hand , ifn - l4 differs from ifn - l3 in its il - 1 0 r2 - binding region sequence , its weaker secretion , and , on the basis of the ifnl4 - dg genotype associations , its impairment of viral clearance in hcv - infected individuals ."
"there is also evidence that ifn - l4 , unlike most ifns , is a poorly secreted protein .","as indicated earlier , there is now strong evidence that ifn - l4 signals through the ifn - lr1 / il - 1 0 r2 receptor complex despite relatively low sequence similarity with ifn - l3 in the region which binds to the il - 1 0 r2 chain ."
"a recent report suggests that , among patients with chronic hepatitis c who carry the ifnl4 - dg allele , lower eression of ifnl4 mrna was associated with a higher rate of svr in response to pegylated ifn - a and ribavirin therapy ( konishi and others ) .","if that is the case , regulatory genetic variants or clinical factors that might modulate ifnl4 eression could impact hcv clearance in individuals who carry ifnl4 - dg , and the measurement of ifn - l4 in peripheral blood might be a clinically useful biomarker ."
"these results suggest that the ifnl4 - dg genotype may be relevant for ifn - a - free daa regimens ; however , with the treatment of sufficient duration , it appears that the genetic effect of ifnl4 - dg can be overcome and almost all patients may respond to treatment ( lawitz and others ) .","however , daa regimens promise to be very eensive ( lancet ) , and treatment costs might be reduced if the duration of therapy could be personalized on the basis of the ifnl4 - dg genotype and other factors ."
"it is also possible , however , that ifn - l4 plays an important role in contemporary infectious diseases other than hcv .",associations with other infections might be detected through studies based on the ifnl4 - dg genotype or through gwas .
this discovery raises the question of whether genomic approaches might lead to the discovery of other important immunological genes .,"finally , it is notable that the detection of ifn - l4 involved the complementary use of different genomic approaches , gwas and rna - seq ."
"in particular , the examination of the basis for the vasoactivity observed with some of the hemoglobin based oxygen carriers has led to the insight that several colligative properties of hemoglobin solutions , such as their diffusion coefficient for oxygen , viscosity and colloid oncotic pressure , are important determinants of efficacy .","although none of these materials has yet been licensed for use in north america or europe , the results of research and clinical trials have increased our understanding of oxygen delivery and its regulation ."
the two major impulses driving the development of blood substitutes are concerns about the infectious risks of transfusion and the adequacy of the blood supply .,"although the incidence of transfusion transmitted hiv , hepatitis b virus and hepatitis c virus has been greatly reduced since the mid - 1 9 8 0 s , the threat of new or emerging pathogens , such as west nile virus and the corona virus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome , continue to motivate research into an oxygen carrier which is free of infectious agents ."
"to date , one product , oxyglobin , has been licensed for veterinary use , while its sister product , hemopure , has been approved for limited use in humans in south africa .","thus , eight different companies embarked on the development of a hboc in the s and s ( see table ) ."
"subsequently , however , a study was published comparing resuscitation with normal saline or the same di - aspirin cross - linked hemoglobin tetramer as hemassist in an animal model of traumatic brain injury .",the mean arterial pressure was higher and the cardiac output was lower in the hemoglobin - resuscitated animals .
it was studied in phase ii clinical trials in dialysis and as an oxygen carrying replacement fluid in acute normovolemic hemodilution where it was noted to have a mild systemic pressor effect .,"hemolink - hemosol - this product consists of human hemoglobin polymerized using an oxidized trisaccharide , o - raffinose , followed by a reduction step ."
"it has been studied principally for perioperative use as a ' bridge ' , deferring the need for banked red blood cells .","hemopure - biopure - hemopure , and the veterinary formulation , oxyglobin , consists of bovine hemoglobin which has been polymerized with glutaraldehyde and purified to reduce residual hemoglobin tetramers (< %)."
northfield submitted data from its phase iii trial in trauma to the fda .,they subsequently initiated a new phase iii trial of polyheme in pre - hospital trauma resuscitation and have enrolled more than patients out of a planned .
hemospan - sangart - the newest hboc in clinical trials is prepared by conjugating polyethylene glycol ( peg ) to human hemoglobin .,"this product has been designed with a low p , a large molecular diameter , and a high viscosity ."
"the hbocs under development all have vascular half - lives in the - 24 h range , which is adequate for most acute care applications ( i . e .","nonetheless , considerable progress has been made in developing products which meet many of the criteria for a clinically useful and safe oxygen carrier including : better shelf stability than banked red cells , universal compatibility , useful vascular half - life , absence of infectious agents , avoidance of the known toxicities related to residual stroma , and absence of renal impairment ."
"however , pre - clinical , and is some cases , clinical testing of the hbocs have raised other safety concerns related to vasoactivity and cell toxicity , the latter either as a direct effect or one mediated by oxidative products .","some , but not all of the various hbocs under development have shown a systemic pressor effect and in some cases a pulmonary pressor effect as well usually accompanied by decreased heart rate and cardiac output , an indicator of increased systemic vascular resistance ."
the pressor effect also does not correlate well with no affinity .,"although a substantial pressor effect was seen with stabilized hemoglobin tetramers , such as the diaspirin linked hemoglobin ( hemassist ) , it was also present in formulations consisting almost entirely of higher order n - mers of hemoglobin with very little residual tetramer , such as poly - heme and hemopure ."
a drop in shear stress ( viscosity ) triggers down - regulation of the production of no by endothelial cells triggering vasoconstriction .,"the endothelial cells lining small vessels appear to sense shear stress , a property of a moving fluid , which is directly proportional to viscosity ."
"where = viscosity , q = net vascular fluid movement which is a function of cop , and d = blood vessel diameter .",hbocs with high cop and high viscosity would be eected to maintain a high level of shear stress and a vasodilated state .
"based on the observation that terminal arterioles are innervated , guyton originally proposed that they may play an active role in regulating blood flow through the capillary beds they supply .","in recent years , a more detailed autoregulatory theory has been proposed based on observations in animal eeriments and model systems ."
"in addition , extensive eerimentation in animal and model systems has shown that hbocs which unload o at the level of the pre - capillary arteriole trigger vasoconstriction consistent with this autoregulatory model .",several characteristics of the hbocs may affect their propensity to deliver o to the arterial wall .
it might be eected that an hboc with high oxygen affinity ( low p ) would unload less o than one with low affinity and therefore be less likely to trigger a vasoconstrictive response .,another factor which could affect o delivery to the arterial wall is the oxygen affinity of the hboc .
"some of the deleterious effects noted in clinical trials , including the systemic pressor effect , may have reflected regional vasoconstriction and impairment of tissue oxygenation .","these studies now suggest that an hboc with high viscosity , high cop and large molecular radius ( low o diffusion coefficient ) is less likely to trigger a vasoconstrictive response , improving flow and oxygen delivery to the capillary beds ."
"however , the studies of the various hbocs over the past decade have re - shaped our thinking about the mechanisms of oxygen delivery and its regulation .",the search for a clinically useful oxygen carrier has proven to be arduous and time - consuming .

"this review will cover how ms - based analyses , such as released glycan profiles , glycan site localization , site - occupancy , and site - specific heterogeneity , are being utilized to map vsp glycosylation .",mass spectrometry ( ms ) has arisen as a pivotal technique for the characterization of vsp glycosylation .
"glycosylation of vsps occurs as they pass through the cellular secretory pathway , which is also where cellular protein glycosylation occurs .","the diversity of glycosidase and glycosyltransferase eression in different cells , and the non - template driven process by which all types of glycosylation occurs results in each vsp being a heterogeneous population differentiated by their glycans ."
"to tackle this analytical challenge , mass spectrometry ( ms ) has become the standard tool to map protein glycosylation .",this heterogeneity is an integral part in how viruses escape the host immune system but has always been considered a complex task .
"c - linked or c - mannosylation is the rarest form , occurring at the carbon of the first tryptophan residue in the consensus sequence w - x-x - w , w - x-x - c , or w - x-x - f ( where x represents any amino acid ) .",c - mannosylation has only been reported at one site on the soluble glycoprotein ( gp ) of the ebov even though the consensus site can be observed on other vsps .
"most vsps contain nglycosylation with hiv - 1 , coronavirus ( cov ) , and ebov surface proteins containing more than n - glycosylation sites and flu and lasv containing fewer than n - glycosylation sites .","as the protein passes through the golgi apparatus , differentially eressed glycosidases and glycosyltransferases further trim , elongate , and branch the glycan moiety resulting in hybrid or complex - type n - glycans ."
"mucin - type o - glycan modifications are initiated by a family of galnactransferases in the golgi apparatus that add the initial galnac monosaccharide to s , t , and sometimes y residues .",the o - linked glycans can be further elongated by competing glycosyltransferases to form up to eight core structures .
applying modern ms - based methods for the robust characterization of vsp glycosylation involves using a variety of techniques that provide different levels of glycoprotein detail .,"for example , ms of released glycans gives an overall profile of the type of oligosaccharides that exist for a given vsp ."
this type of vsp glycan analysis confirmed vsp glycosylation was dependent on the cells eressing the virus .,a common starting point for initial characterization of vsps is ms analysis of released glycans ( figure a ) .
n - glycans are usually released via a peptide - n - glycosidase f ( pngase f ) enzymatic digestion .,"when the o - glycans from five pathogenic ebov gp , 2 s were compared , differences in o - glycan patterns were observed ."
"for researchers , the site of attachment provides information that can be applied to mutational studies to identify glycan sites that are critical to the proteins ' functional role and / or identify sites that play a role in immune evasion .",another level of glycoprofiling is to localize the amino acid site of attachment of the oligosaccharide on the protein .
"each endo has specificity for a different type of n - glycan , but all cleave between the two glcnac residues in the diactylchiobiose core of the oligosaccharide leaving a single glcnac or a disaccharide of fucglcnac linked to the asparagine .","these glycopeptides are identified by tandem ms using electron transfer dissociation ( etd ) fragmentation , which preferentially cleaves along the peptide backbone ( n - ca bond ) leaving the sugar moiety intact ( figure c ) ."
"in order to obtain site occupancy , n - glycans are released using pngase f ( as mentioned above converting n to d ) .",the resultant peptides containing aspartic acid are used to determine the extent of glycan occupancy at a given ngs .
a recent protocol for the global site - specific analysis of n - glycan processing made use of two endo treatments to viral surface protein glycosylation hargett and,"the desaire and crispin groups have developed combinations of ms methodologies ( including those described above ) for the characterization of vsp glycosylation , namely for hiv - 1 env ."
"( c ) three of the same ngs presented as a weighted distribution graph of every oligosaccharide observed organized based on how n - glycans are processed ( high - mannose glycans ( yellow ) , hybrid glycans ( green ) , complex glycans ( blue ) ) .",a darker shading is used to indicate oligosaccharides that contain a sialic acid .
"these strategies have arisen from the need for a hiv - 1 vaccine that utilizes hiv - 1 env , which contains - 90 n - glycans .","introduce unique mass signatures for ( potential ) sites of glycosylation that carry no glycan , high - mannose / hybrid type glycans , and complex glycans ."
the high degree of reproducibility between technical and biological replicates along with reports demonstrating glycopeptide ionization is driven by the peptide ( not the glycan ) has resulted in quantitative profiles becoming a standard mode of reporting single - site heterogeneity .,"after its initial use with hiv - 1 gp120 , these quantitative profiles have been reported for hcv e2 , flu ha , and lasv gpc ."
this has allowed ms to bridge the gap between analytically characterizing vsp glycosylation and making that information accessible and usable .,"thus , allowing researchers to do comparative vsp glycan profiling analysis in the context of their own molecular eeriments ."
modeling glycan profile data onto the solved vsp structures or reporting glycan profile data in the context of the overall structure provides an additional layer of information .,"to overcome the heterogeneity problem , groups have used ab binding enrichment or glycosidase deficient cell lines to select for specific glycan types ."
a study of the cov spike glycoprotein combined em data and ms data and confirmed of potential ngs that were subsequently mapped onto the structure or resulting schematic .,"from this analysis , glycans masking the receptor binding loops of conserved regions were observed ."
"alternatively , modeling / mapping ms glycan profiling data to their location on solved structures corroborates the overall type of site - specific heterogeneity profiles .","for n - glycosylation , heterogeneity profiles can be subdivided into three categories : high - mannose , mixed , and complex or predominantly processed sites ."
"glycan mutagenesis studies of west nile virus ( wnv ) , hendra virus , nipah virus , and hcv to name a few have all been shown to have glycosylation sites with vital roles in infectivity , protein folding , tropism , proteolytic processing , and immune evasion [ 7 , , .","however , when these results vary based off viral strain or the glycosylation site is not in an obvious inhibitory location on the structure , it can be difficult to understand the mechanism by which the glycan alters the vsp function ."
"understanding how this heterogenous post - translational modification can fine - tune vsp function will provide unique insights into virus biology , which can only be addressed by considering the vsps and the attached glycan as one complete biomolecule .","when the glycoprofiling data are used in conjunction with molecular and structural eeriments , virologist can begin to establish how specific glycans and glycan types may affect virulence through modulating virus receptor binding , masking antigenic sites , or by stimulating the host immune response ."
"the amplicons were sequenced , and several viruses were found , including the human bocavirus , with subsequent identificatio of sensitive and specifi primer sequences .","the virus has now been found by at least groups of investigators in europe , the united kingdom , the united states , canada , asia , and australia ."
all of the studies but one have found that the virus is most frequently detected in infants ! 3 years of age .,"in the published studies of hbov , the virus was detected in % - 11.3% of individuals with acute respiratory illness who had respiratory samples screened for hbov , with a frequency of detection of % - 5.5% noted for most of the studies ."
"it does not , however , prove causality , although it adds important corroborative support .","finding , in studies , a zero or very low incidence among control infants of the same age , sampled over the same time period in the same hospitals , is a huge advance in this regard , because it provides a statistical association of the virus with disease ."
"for many respiratory viruses , "" proof "" of pathogenicity has come from carefully controlled inoculation of adult volunteers , but this has become increasingly difficul with increased ethical concerns and the closing of the common cold research unit in salisbury , england ( where coronaviruses and rhinoviruses have been shown to cause colds and where many other viruses , including parvovirus b19 , have been shown to be pathogenic ) .","proof of causality rarely emerges from one study , and we usually depend on an accumulation of evidence : the presence of an organism in diseased tissues ( and not in control tissues ) ; development of specific immunity ; and consistent association , over time and space , of an organism with a particular disease or group of diseases ."
"it seems also that the virus is seasonal , being found primarily during the fall , winter , and spring , and not in the summer , although not all studies agree , and although some studies did not sample during the entire year .","published in the present issue of the journal , examined only specimens that had already been found to be negative for other viruses , so that information about coinfection could not be obtained ."
so there is lots of work that remains to be done .,"we know nothing about the mode of transmission , the frequency of transmission in the hospital ( we do know that of the new haven cases of infection were nosocomially acquired ) , or family epidemiology ."
"multiplex pcr will , at some point , become the standard method for investigating the etiology of respiratory infections .","as time goes on , it is very likely that this methodology , or something closely related , will become both ineensive and widely available ."
a growing body of evidence suggests the non - protein coding human genome is of vital importance for human cell function .,"besides small rnas , the diverse class of long non - coding rnas ( lncrnas ) recently came into focus ."
"mechanisms of lncrna action are diverse and they are involved in widespread biological processes like imprinting , pluripotency , cell differentiation , development , apoptosis , and development of disease .","several studies have revealed that lncrnas are important for gene regulation , , such as xist , which regulates dosage compensation of the mammalian x chromosome ."
"due to differences in nomenclature and annotation of both microarrays , ncode and sureprint g3 ncrna probe sequences were re - annotated using the current ensembl genome annotation ( release ) .","besides other noncoding rna classes , the sureprint g3 annotation is mainly based on human lincrnas identified during chip - seq projects ."
"as eected , the distribution of the differentially regulated non - coding rna genes in both microarray systems mirrored the distribution of the represented ncrna classes .","thus , the most abundantly represented class was lincrnas , which are listed in figure b ."
"interestingly , a similar level of eression was induced following infection with vsv but not with the ibv strain b / brisbane / 60 / 08 .","infection with all tested viruses yielded a cell infection rate between - 70% , excluding the possibility that different infectivities adversely affected vin eression ( fig ."
"a wide range of poly i concentrations failed to induce vin eression , whereas eression of ifn increased in a concentration - dependent manner ( fig .","to investigate whether the factor responsible for induction of vin was viral rna , we treated a549 cells with polyinosiniclycytidylic acid ( poly i - a synthetic analog of double - stranded rna commonly used to mimic viral rna intermediates that are present during virus infection ."
"to summarize , vin eression was induced upon infection with a number of iav viruses , and also after infection with vsv , suggesting that this lincrna may have broader functionality during virus infection .","however , since ibv , viral rna mimics , or ifn are not able to induce vin , this induction is likely to be a specific response and not due the presence of viral rna itself ."
"the tightly controlled transcription of lncrnas and the fact that they appear to play a role in many tissues , highlights their potential in regulating important aspects of the cellular machinery .","research into hostpathogen interactions has so far focused mostly on host cell proteins , , and not yet considered the role of lncrnas in detail ."
the first report about lncrnas in the context of viral infections showed induction of a lncrna upon japanese encephalitis and rabies virus infection in mice .,"interestingly , dynamic changes in eression levels of lncrnas have been identified upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation of macrophages , demonstrating the importance of lncrnas during immune surveillance ."
"differences in the protein repertoire encoded by vsv , iav , and ibv , or differential host cell signaling during infection , could also be responsible for distinct vin regulation profiles .",", however , the contribution of virus - specific factors on vin eression , and the function of vin during vsv and ibv infection , will need further investigation ."
"nuclear lncrnas have been implicated in the maintenance of sub - nuclear architecture , direct transcriptional regulation , post - transcriptional control , and chromatin remodeling .","however , it remains to be demonstrated which function vin conducts in the nucleus of iav - infected cells ."
nuclear eression of vin suggests an involvement in gene - regulatory processes and our observation that vin is functionally relevant during pathogenesis of iav infection strengthens the view that lncrnas are major players in diverse biological processes .,"induction of vin eression was observed in different virus infections , and vin loss - of - function analysis revealed its importance during productive iav replication ."

"multiple sets of clinical practice guidelines have been published in the past few years addressing the treatment of cap , and they all agree that cap patients admitted to the hospital represent a major concern , and appropriate empiric therapy should be instituted to improve clinical outcomes .",icu patients carry the highest mortality rates among all patients with cap .
"elderly and nursing home patients are also at significant risk for cap and have high mortality rates , although some eerts consider pneumonia in nursing home patients as health care associated pneumonia due to the similarities in the etiologic pathogens with hospital acquired pneumonia .",hospitalization rates for pneumonia have increased among us adults aged - 74 years and aged - 84 years during the past years .
"consistently , streptococcus pneumoniae is recognized as the most common pathogen causing cap .",the microbial patterns of severe cap have been extensively studied in the past decade .
"this decision is usually made in the outpatient office or in the emergency department , and has implications for the antibiotic class selection , route , and duration of therapy .","two tools have been developed to predict mortality and to determine the site of care for patients with cap based on the severity of illness , the pneumonia - specific severity of illness ( psi ) score and the curb rule ."
"these tests include : complete blood cell count and differential , basic blood chemistry ( urea nitrogen and serum creatinine ) electrolytes ( sodium and potassium ) , glucose , and liver function tests .",several laboratory studies should be performed in patients with cap admitted to the icu in order to assess the severity of the disease and possible complications .
"in all clinical series , approximately % of patients with cap have no pathogen identified .","in cases in which the infecting pathogen can be identified , directed therapy should be employed ."
"from the limited data and significant heterogeneity between studies , we conclude that there is limited information to compare the differences in mortality for patients with cap in the icu .","on the other hand , there is strong evidence supporting the clinical practice guidelines by demonstrating statistically significant benefit for those patients receiving guideline concordant therapies in patients with cap ."
"in addition , measures directed at prevention such as vaccination for pneumococcal and influenza infections , and counseling to quit smoking for patients at risk , may help to decrease the incidence of cap .","several of the quality indicators already mentioned , early administration of antibiotics , appropriate antibiotic use following the clinical practice guidelines , use of a critical pathway , switch to oral therapy and early discharge all show improved clinical outcomes in cap ."
"copd currently accounts for approximately , 000 deaths per year , making it , following heart disease , cancer , and stroke , the fourth leading cause of death in the united states .","it has been estimated that by the year , aecopd will be the third leading cause of death ."
there have been several recent studies demonstrating that patients with the most severe copd and those that required icu care have significantly higher prevalence of gram - negative organisms such as enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species .,several investigators have proposed that airway damage from chronic infection or colonization occurs in these patients because the bacteria cause the host to continuously release inflammatory mediators .
these reviews concluded that data on the utility of most diagnostic tests are limited .,"however , chest radiography and arterial blood gas sampling are useful while spirometry is performed at the time of the exacerbation is not ."
there have been a number of clinical trials examining the use of antibiotics in the treatment of aecopd .,"the gold guideline , ( gold website , accessed feb . ) and the american thoracic society / european respiratory society ( ats / ers ) copd consensus guidelines recommend antibiotic choices on the basis of local sensitivity patterns of the most common pathogens associated with aecopd , and provide specific guidelines ."
"this study demonstrated that a significant number of gramnegative organisms ( including e . coli , p . mirabilis , and p . aeruginosa ) were identified in their population of patients with severe aecopd .","in addition to supporting the findings of the previously reported studies , this trial demonstrated that treating these pathogens is important for improving outcomes in this high - risk population ."
"because treatment with appropriate antibiotics significantly decreases the bacterial burden at - h follow - up bronchoscopy , it is speculated that the proper choice of antibiotic reduces the risk of progression to more severe infections , such as pneumonia .","the eradication of bacteria by antibiotics is thought to break the vicious cycle of infection , i . e . , lung destruction leading to progression of the lung disease ."
"a recent retrospective study of outpatients with documented copd , conducted at our institution , evaluated the risk factors for therapy failure at days after an acute exacerbation .",one group of patients received antibiotics and the second group did not .
the type of antibiotic used was also an important variable associated with the - day treatment failure .,patients treated with amoxicillin had a % relapse rate compared with only % for the other antibiotics ( p < 1 ) .
most of these end - points rely solely on the subjective report of symptom improvement .,conventional end - points for efficacy of antibiotics treatment in aecopd include the symptoms and bacteriological resolution measured at weeks after the treatment was started .
the impact of influenza is critical to the development of other lower respiratory infections including aecopd and pneumonia .,"epidemiological studies have shown that the frequency of lower respiratory infections , and associated morbidity and mortality , are markedly reduced with influenza vaccination ."
because these are heterogeneous groups of patients it is important to use risk - stratification based on clinical parameters and prediction tools .,appropriate antibiotic therapy is an important component in the management of both groups of patients .
"these agents , ace inhibitors ( aceis ) and angiotensin ii receptor blockers ( arbs ) are widely used in the treatment of hypertension , heart failure , chronic kidney disease , and diabetes .","the cellular receptor for sars - cov - 2 is angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ace2 ) , a mostly membrane - bound homologue of angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ace ) that has generated great interest in the interaction between covid - 19 and the renin - angiotensin system ( ras ) , as well as in the medicines commonly used to block the ras ."
"s1 given that other viruses that enter via the lung might use ace2 as receptors , low levels of ace2 in the lung might help to reduce entry and provide an evolutionary advantage in survival .","despite the higher levels of ace2 observed in the kidney , the incidence of acute kidney injury in covid - 19 is relatively low ( 29% ) , in contrast to % incidence of severe lung injury , which requires mechanical ventilation ."
"internalization of the virus depletes membrane - bound ace2 , possibly increasing angii , which could potentiate lung injury .","sars - cov - 2 enters cells by binding its spike ( s ) protein to ace2 , a step that is essential for lung injury in covid - 19 ."
"in an eerimental model of sars - coronavirus lung injury , despite elevated tissue levels of angii , atr1 blockade with the arb losartan attenuated severe acute lung injury and pulmonary edema .","this is in line with findings in hypertensive humans , which showed that the arb olmesartan increased urinary ace2 levels ."
"alternatively , increased ace2 could potentially have the opposite result by promoting viral ports of entry into cells .","it has been hypothesized that use of arbs increases ace2 , which could potentially be beneficial in treating covid - 19 because the increased ace2 could prevent lung damage by preserving ace2 despite sars - cov - 2 entry into the cells ."
the significance of this observation is unclear given the measurement difficulty and high variability in angii measurements in humans .,a case series from china of hospitalized patients with confirmed covid - 19 found that circulating levels of angii were significantly elevated and negatively correlated with viral load and lung injury as determined by oxygenation .
"thus , at present , the effect of either aceis or arbs in patients with known covid - 19 infection on the severity of illness during the virus infection remains unknown and it is unclear whether the differences between acei and arb are clinically relevant in these patients .","currently , the authors continue to administer these drugs to patients unless they are critically ill and at high risk for hypotension and kidney injury ."
de - identified patient data and outcomes on the use of ras agents and covid - 19 infections should be placed on the web and made publicly available to help further research .,additional eerimental studies examining the complex relationships between covid - 19 and the ras would greatly benefit future treatment approaches .
"this can be achieved as a collaborative effort by feeding a central library of the medical examples encountered and rapidly sharing eert opinions to frontline medical care staff , nationally and internationally .","the precise role for computed tomography ( ct ) in the diagnosis and triage of suspected cases , assessing for complications , and surveillance is subject to change and are elored in other articles in this edition , ; however , keeping the uk diagnostic community fully informed of emerging guidance during the covid - 19 outbreak is critical ."
"the british society of thoracic imaging ( bsti ) , in conjunction with cimar uk ' s imaging cloud technology ( cimar . co . uk ) , have designed , built , and deployed a simple , free to use , anonymised , and encrypted online portal to upload and refer imaging of patients with either confirmed or suspected covid - 19 .","from these cases , the bsti are providing an imaging database of known uk patient examples for reference and teaching ."
"such a database would also allow real - time tracking of confirmed ct cases and allow improved understanding of the significance of cases with positive ct findings , but negative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) results .",this will help collate valuable information for the nhs and public health england .
"users can view the published teaching library , diagnostic observations , and training materials online using chrome , firefox , safari , apple or pc machines , as well as any other browser or mobile device .","a diagnostic food and drug administration ( fda ) approved html5 viewer loads automatically for the user , so no special software , downloads , or installations are required to access and use the resource ."
", of existing radiologists , "" chest / lung "" is the fifth most popular subspecialty interest , but the provision of subspecialty thoracic radiology also varies dramatically across the uk .","there is a national shortage of radiologists , with the current shortfall estimated to be , 104 ."
", through a united effort to submit cases to the bsti covid - 19 imaging repository and database across the entire nhs , there is a real opportunity to add to the evidence base in the diagnosis and risk stratification of cases .","the case upload with be accompanied by brief clinic metrics ( including patient age , sex , white cell count , creactive protein , p02 , indication for the imaging , rt - pcr status , prior imaging ) , which will help understand the temporal trends in imaging and the relevance of imaging findings in the context of known clinical and laboratory data ."
"it is shown that there exists a critical value = for the psychological effect , and two critical values k = k , k ( k < k ) for the infection rate such that : ( i ) when > , or and k k , the disease will die out for all positive initial populations ; ( ii ) when = and k < k k , the disease will die out for almost all positive initial populations ; ( iii ) when = and k > k , the disease will persist in the form of a positive coexistent steady state for some positive initial populations ; and ( iv ) when < and k > k , the disease will persist in the form of multiple positive periodic coexistent oscillations and coexistent steady states for some positive initial populations .","it is shown that there are a weak focus of multiplicity at most two and a cusp of codimension at most two for various parameter values , and the model undergoes saddle - node bifurcation , bogdanov - takens bifurcation of codimension two , hopf bifurcation , and degenerate hopf bifurcation of codimension two as the parameters vary ."
"assuming the recovered individuals have temporary immunity , the classical susceptibleinfectious - recovered ( sirs ) model can be written as follows :","in the classical infectious disease transmission models ( kermack and mckendrick , hethcote ) , the population is divided into three classes labeled by s ( t ) , i ( t ) and r ( t ) , representing the numbers of susceptible , infective , and recovered or removed individuals at time t , respectively ."
"g ( i ) s is called the incidence rate , and g ( i ) is a function to measure the infection force of a disease .","where b is the recruitment rate of the population , d is the natural death rate of the population , is the natural recovery rate of the infective individuals , is the rate at which recovered individuals lose immunity and return to the susceptible class ."
"however , when i is large and the disease becomes more serious , psychological factor leads people to implementing measures to control the spread of the disease .","this implies that the contact rate and the infection probability are increasing when a new infectious disease emerges , since people have very little knowledge about the disease ."
"note that both nonmonotone incidence functions ki + i and ki + i + i , given in ( 1.6 ) and ( 1.7 ) , tend to zero when i goes to infinite , which indicates that the psychological or inhibitory effect from the behavioral change of the susceptible individuals or from the crowding effect of the infective individuals is too strong , which may be unreasonable for some specific infectious diseases , such as influenza .","thus , a more reasonable incidence function g ( i ) may be one that first increases to a maximum when a new infectious disease emerges or an old infectious disease reemerges , then decreases due to psychological effect , and eventually tends to a saturation level due to crowding effect ."
they also conjectured that model ( 1.1 ) with nonmonotone incidence rate would not exhibit complicated dynamics and bifurcations .,"moreover , they claimed the existence of bogdanov - takens bifurcation of codimension three ."
"more precisely , we will show that there are a weak focus of multiplicity at most two and a cusp of codimension at most two for various parameter values , and the model undergoes saddle - node bifurcation , bogdanov - takens bifurcation of codimension two , hopf bifurcation , and degenerate hopf bifurcation of codimension two as the parameters vary .","by considering a more general model , our results show that bogdanov - takens bifurcation of codimension higher than two cannot occur , which clarifies and corrects the corresponding results obtained by tang et al ."
"to show that the assertion ( ii ) holds , let x = x x * , y = y y * , n = n * and q = q .","then using taylor eansions , we can rewrite system ( 2.3 ) as follows ( for simplicity , we still denote x , y by x , y , respectively )"
"moreover , e is always a hyperbolic saddle and e is","when n < n * , a > mp and conditions ( 2.4 ) are satisfied , then system ( 2.3 ) has two positive equilibria e (x , y ) and e (x , y ) ."
"from theorems , and , we know that system ( 2.3 ) may exhibit saddle - node bifurcation , bogdanov - takens bifurcation around the equilibrium e * (x * , y * ) , and hopf bifurcation around the equilibrium e (x , y ) .","in this section , we investigate various possible bifurcations in system ( 2.3 ) ."
"this implies that there exists a critical psychological effect value such that the disease cannot invade the population when > ( i . e . , n > n * ) , and the disease will persist for some positive initial populations when ( i . e . , n n * ) .","when the parameters are varied to cross the surface from one side to the other side , the number of positive equilibria of system ( 2.3 ) changes from zero to two , the saddle - node bifurcation yields two positive equilibria ."
( e ) an unstable limit cycle will appear through the subcritical hopf bifurcation around e when the parameters are varied to cross the h curve into region iii ( see fig .,"( d ) ) , where the focus e is stable , whereas the focus e is an unstable one with multiplicity one when the parameters lie on the curve h ."
"note that x x = p np + q + 1 for system ( 2.3 ) , which becomes x x = p np + q + 1 under the parameter scaling ( 3.10 ) , dropping the bars , so we have np + q + p > because x x < .","regarding the above parameter scaling , the condition ( 2.4 ) , n < n * and a > mp become"
"since the transformation ( 3.10 ) is a linear sign - reserving transformation , system ( 3.12 ) and system ( 2.3 ) have the same qualitative property .","next letting dt = ( 1 + mx + nx ) d and substituting a = p ( 1 + m + n ) + q + into ( 3.12 ) , we obtain ( still denote by t )"
"when conditions in ( 3.13 ) hold , system ( 3.14 ) has an equilibrium at .","moreover , ( i ) when a < a * , is an unstable hyperbolic node or focus ; ( ii ) when a > a * , is a locally asymptotically stable hyperbolic node or focus ; ( iii ) when a = a * , is a fine focus or center ."
"by conditions in ( 3.15 ) , the sign of is the same as that of","where c , c , c , d , d and d are given in ( 3.9 ) ."

"using the formal series method in and matlab software , we obtain the second lyapunov coefficient","from ( ii . 3 ) of theorem , we know that system ( 3.14 ) may exhibit degenerate hopf bifurcation ( i . e . , hopf bifurcation of codimension two ) when q = q , m < m < m and conditions ( 3.15 ) are satisfied ."
"then , a h = p + m + n > and c is reduced to c = p q .",note that the condition q < p a = p a h becomes
"since v and v have the same sign of f and f , respectively , we consider the polynomials f and f .","in the following , we prove that when v = , v > for the parameters satisfying the conditions in ( 3.25 ) ."
"first , suppose that the two polynomial equations f = f = have solutions for p and q and we study if the solutions satisfy the conditions in ( 3.25 ) .","note that f is linear in q , we solve q from f = to obtain q = ( 1 + m + n ) ( 1 + p ) p ( mn + m + n ) + ( 1 + m + n ) ( n ) p ( mn + m + mn + n n ) + m + mn + n + n , ( 3.27 ) and then substitute it into f to get f = ( n ) ( 1 + m + n ) ( 1 + p ) p p ( mn + m + n )"
"summarizing the above results shows that if the two sets of solutions satisfy v = v = , they must satisfy the conditions given in ( 3.25 ) as well as > .","to have real solutions for p and q , it requires > ."
"then plot the curves = and c k = , k = , , on the m - n plane , and identify the regions on the boundary regime : < n < , + m + n > , satisfying > and c k > , k = , , .","if these regions do not overlap , then no solutions exist ; if these regions do overlap , we need to further check the last condition in ( 3.25 ) , q < q max ."
"therefore , the next best choice is to have v = and v = , and p can then be treated as a free parameter .",the above proof implies that v must be kept the same sign for the feasible parameter values .
"firstly , we fix n = / 3 , p = and m = , then get q = from = , and get a = from tr ( j ) = , finally get = 5719 , i . e . , is an unstable multiple focus with multiplicity two for those fixed parameters .",. 5 to show the existence of two limit cycles based on theorems and .
most parameter values can be obtained from the literature or by estimation .,"we estimate k , , , and r by using the unconstrained optimization functions f minsearch , a part of the optimization toolbox in matlab , to fit i ( t i ) through discretizing the ordinary differential system ( 2.1 ) as follows"
"it has been shown that there exists a weak focus of multiplicity at most two and a cusp of codimension at most two for various parameter values , and the model undergoes saddle - node bifurcation , bogdanov - takens bifurcation of codimension two , hopf bifurcation and degenerate hopf bifurcation of codimension two as the parameter values vary .","by considering a more general model , our results show that bogdanov - takens bifurcation of codimension higher than two cannot occur , which clarifies and corrects the corresponding results by tang et al ."
so can we give a quantitative description about the psychological effect with respect to variation of the parameters involved in the infectious diseases ?,"in this paper , we presented a concrete critical value to measure the psychological effect ."
alibaba ' s continuous efforts to build legitimacy facilitated platform evolution despite its eed weakness in intellectual property rights .,we select the case of alibaba and argue that alibaba was especially competent in building legitimacy .
"accordingly , east asia has received significant attention from scholars , policy makers , and business practitioners as a locus of entrepreneurship and innovation .","due to the fast development of the internet and the mobile infrastructure , several "" young "" firms quickly became national market leaders and have moved into international markets ( china daily , ) ."
"a drastic , recent social change is in the mode of transaction .","however , social changes as a result of growth in the digital economy are never identical , not even within east asia ."
"thus far , most studies have elained differences in e - commerce development among countries using three general approaches .","the first approach focuses on culture - for example , uncertainty avoidance in internet use ( oxley and yeung , ) , collectivism leading to bandwagon effects ( yoon , ) , and preferences for traditional transaction practices ( poon and swatman , ) ."
"leveraging their positions in the industry , they have been creating different patterns of interactions within current institutional environments and thereby have benefitted from legitimacy successfully established in the environmental context .","the leading platform firms in east asia , such as alibaba , gmarket , and rakuten , are the central entities in the national e - commerce industry ."
"because a firm is a socio - economic entity , it feels pressure to gain legitimacy from stakeholders for its broad acceptance ( bergek et al . , ) .","hence , it is reasonable to assume that firms in the e - commerce platform industry try to build legitimacy in the given institutional environment , which in turn facilitates political , technical , and social acceptance and , further , leads to industrial development ."
"this research setting attracts us particularly because , most of all , china is growing quickly and is now the largest e - commerce market , showing % of compounded annual growth during ( mckinsey and company , .","in order to address the questions , we choose the e - commerce platform business in china and conduct an eloratory study ."
"this remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section , we introduce the social legitimacy theory and conceptualize the model , and in section , we elain the research method .","although there are alternative elanations , such as strategic or operational approaches , to elain china ' s e - commerce platform development ( martinsons , ) , we suggest a complementary , rather than a competitive , view of china ' s fast growth in the e - commerce platform industry ."
"the social validation process occurs differently for each firm , and , thus , the level of legitimacy differs among firms .","legitimation goes through a social validation process that consists of the recognition of a distinctive competency possessed or role played by the organization in providing a good or service ( dacin et al . , ) ."
"institutional theory has regarded organizational actions as outcomes of the social justification process ( dimaggio and powell , ; scott , ) .","firms engage in organizational actions out of their motivations to be socially and normatively recognized by stakeholders , which include shareholders , customers , governments , suppliers , and alliance partners ."
"researchers propose that market legitimacy is especially pertinent and de facto required when governmental authority over business is substantial and government endorsement is essential for existence in a particular market ( peng , ; yiu and makino , ) .","for example , the chinese government mandated a markettechnology swap policy as a condition for foreign firms ' entrance in china and wanted multinational enterprises to contribute to the local technological capability ."
"therefore , the need for relational legitimacy is essential for firms that have to deal with a large number of stakeholders .","relational legitimacy enables firms to obtain trust and reliability from stakeholders , and , by so doing , the firms can have a wider range of partner choices in relationship formation ( dacin et al . , ) ."
"in addition , social legitimacy is also an essential part of the legitimacy function in a firm ' s socio - institutional environment .","time and space generate different contexts of social responsiveness and corporate social responsibility because all economic activity is embedded within a broader social or institutional context of societal norms , rules , and eectations that defines socially acceptable economic behavior ( dacin et al . , ; zukin and dimaggio , ) ."
"accordingly , whether or not certain technologies as well as firms are accepted may differ depending on the rationales desired by the given societies .","these technologies co - evolve with institutional environments , but as business history has demonstrated , many technologies have been turned down by the users or been overridden by emergent competitor technologies ( bergek et al . , ) ."
"research has tended to highlight either technical aspects or socio - economic traits ( thatcher et al . , ) .",a large volume of literature has investigated the determinants of initiation and institutionalization of e - commerce technology acceptance based on environmental analysis .
"at the same time , although current e - commerce studies are fundamentally based on the technical advancement itself , which should spread quickly across countries ( wong , ) , the interaction between these technologies and the institutional environment may shape a unique trajectory in each country .","technology - related institutions , such as platforms , may be more influential on the growth of e - commerce ( martinsons , ) ."
"in the service aspects , e - payment systems , secure messaging , and electronic markets have been regarded as the primary diffusion factors ( efendioglu and yip , ; oxley and yeung , ) .","more fundamentally , the institutional environment is built upon the level of strength of the institutional pressure ( gibbs and kraemer , ) ; openness to external trade and investment , global competition , and industry structure as key determinants of e - commerce diffusion ( gibbs et al . , ) ; and the respect for the rule of law and credibility in the payment channel ( oxley and yeung , ) ."
the normative pillar is the preference for personal face - to - face communications or the social norms .,"one is the regulative pillar , which addresses the rule of law , the existence of laws that govern the online transactions , and controls on the internet ."
"platform firms in the e - commerce industry have to interact with consumers , sellers , regulators , technical partners , and shareholders .","in order to continue industrial development , firms as well as technologies should be accepted by society ."
"there were fears that merchants might sell defective products , that merchants could be dishonest thieves , and that online payments cannot be recovered even if the product is not delivered .","for another example , during the early stage of e - commerce , the chinese government was either unwilling or unable to fully enforce many of the internet and e - commerce regulations it instituted ( efendioglu and yip , ) ."
"besides the e - commerce intermediaries , credit card companies play an important role in monitoring and certification of commercial transactions , providing assurance to both buyers and sellers ( oxley and yeung , ) .","because two parties make a transaction through technology , e - commerce intermediaries increase the credibility of information delivered over the internet , mitigating possible fraudulence online ."
"at the same time , it means that alibaba ' s legitimacy has been essential in elaining its market success .",this fact sufficiently qualifies alibaba as a key object to study in china ' s e - commerce industry .
"overall , we have conducted seven interviews , with each interview lasting h on average per visit .","in order to obtain interview data about legitimacy building by alibaba , we have accessed mainly alibaba ' s stakeholders , including suppliers , consumer groups , and r & d partners ."
"these b2b firms included chemnet , , alibaba , joybuy , and dangdang ( china e - commerce research center , ) .","since its advent , b2b has remained as the largest share of china ' s e - commerce market in terms of trade volume , although the dotcom bubble burst slowed growth in the early s ."
"as a result , china ' s e - commerce elosively grew until , when the global financial crisis triggered recession in the world market .","due to incomplete institutional arrangements for online payments , alipay began to offer a third - party escrow service in , which enabled transactions between merchants and buyers on taobao ."
several policies were released to promote business environments favorable to the e - commerce industry .,"the period after can be ( china industry news , ) ."
"therefore , it is noteworthy that alibaba has been leading the market with many business models and over time .","the ecommerce evolution in china seems to be , in this regard , the history of alibaba ' s business growth ."
"nevertheless , due to localization failure , ebay left the chinese e - commerce market in save for its global - bound platform only .","there were a number of global platform firms in china , such as ebay , which possessed brands and resources ."
market legitimacy puts forth two points for its conceptual essence : acknowledged qualification and endorsement from authority .,"alibaba ' s market legitimacy has been built most visibly in , among others , the introduction of alipay and collaboration with the chinese government , which led to acknowledged technical excellence and government endorsement ."
"because the business realm of alipay overlaps the current banking system , state - owned banks opposed alibaba ' s permit for the financial operation ( china economic review , ) .","soon after launching taobao in , alibaba tried to resolve these problems by establishing alipay , an escrow service that retains the payment until purchase is delivered and confirmed by the buyer ."
the chinese government evaluated highly the efforts of alipay to promote the e - commerce industry and facilitated relevant institutional arrangements .,"as a result , in april , the "" law of signature "" and the "" regulation on the online trading platform service "" were released , providing a legal foundation for china ' s e - commerce infrastructure ."
"however , their combined market share was quite small compared to that of alipay .","after the alipay service made a debut in china , similar services have been introduced by both domestic and multinational competitors , such as applepay ."
"at the same time , being the first and the only firm in the global market to combine platform and payment has contributed greatly to alibaba ' s market legitimacy building .",taobao ' s absence from profit - seeking activities has been important in understanding alibaba ' s legitimacy building .
"launching g2c led to a win - win situation in that the chinese government welcomed alibaba ' s new launch of the g2c platform as a complementary function to the current government . ""","the transactions via alibaba became officially approved and encouraged by the chinese government , particularly regarding cross - border purchases ."
"the stance gained acceptance from chinese government , supplier , and consumers , which greatly helped alibaba clearly build up its market legitimacy .","as alipay and alibaba ' s g2c business suggest , alibaba had a good reason for market legitimacy when it began a new business that it can effectively "" fill in "" the institutional deficiency ."
"by building relational legitimacy , a firm can be recognized as an exemplary partner in its business network .","alibaba ' s relational legitimacy has been sought broadly in four areas : its efforts to make a transparent communication system , to prioritize attending to the more vulnerable partners in managing relationships , to build a symbiotic business environment ( i . e . , protecting the interests of business partners rather than eloiting them ) , and to present business models imitable by others ."
"in a society where people avoid transactions with strangers , reputation highly matters .","in the early s , chinese consumers still preferred cash payments and face - to - face negotiations ."
"customers have not only communicated with sellers , but they have also been able to leave post - sales reviews .",a manager at one of alibaba ' s partners which supplies customer communication software told us as follows :
"at the same time , alibaba has publicly provided in real time the entire worldwide transactions data .",alibaba was the first in china to technically realize two - way instant communication tools on the platform .
"if a customer does not approve , the money stays in the buyer ' s account and is not transferred to the seller for the next days .","alibaba sequentially introduced additional customer services , which include the return or cancellation of a transaction within seven days without any conditionality ."
"the business partners , the customers , and even the competitors have highly evaluated and respected alibaba for its efforts to pursue mutual benefits and industrial leadership , which greatly enhanced alibaba ' s relational legitimacy .",the business models created by alibaba have enabled china to promote the best environment for e - commerce in the world .
the essence of social legitimacy building is to make commitments to those who are not directly connected to a firm ' s interest .,"the difference between relational legitimacy and social legitimacy is the breadth of context , where social legitimacy incorporates the benefits from a firm ' s behavior to society and the levels of public goods resulting from the firm ' s behaviors ."
"mr . ma asserted , "" i don ' t see any problem in people buying faked goods .",a newspaper interview with jack ma illustrates how alibaba would perceive this issue .
"as of the end of , more than , 000 village - level service centers have been opened in provinces .","these service centers have taken care of the logistics between counties and villages , rural marketing activities , and customer service communications ."
"in essence , taobao village is a cluster of rural products collected and stored within a location administratively classified as village .","in order to eand its supply base to the low - income region , alibaba initiated the virtual establishment of "" taobao village . """
"although taobao also provides solution manuals for platform maneuvers , most rural sellers obtained necessary information from their acquaintances or the community members .",alimama also offers instant communication tools to link buyers and sellers and teaches production promotion through online advertisement .
"due to the under - developed infrastructure in china , supply chain building was difficult in the domestic market .","alibaba instead first eerimented overseas and has operated cainiao in the us , the eu , japan , and korea ."
"nevertheless , after suppliers have managed to ship bulky items using alibaba ' s storage site , they have been able to ask alibaba for more favorable treatment .","when suppliers had to individually ship purchases , suppliers could not exercise any bargaining power over any platform firm ."
i can be as relieved as i used to buy at amazon .,i plan to buy a swedish stroller next time for my niece .
"since alibaba originally intended to promote satisfaction for the low - income class , alibaba ' s social legitimacy was achieved from the part of the society .","however , as the firm improved the overall logistics and relevant infrastructure , the service , once targeting lower - income class , became widely spread to middle - income and high - income classes by offering the international delivery ."
"alibaba used to be involved in several scandals and corruptions , but it has systematically fortified its corporate ethics .","for example , alibaba ' s market directors do not work on a specific item longer than three months or participate in any events requiring seven rounds of selection processes ."
alipay has changed the lifestyle of chinese people : it dominates the e - commerce space and customers also use it for their daily purchases .,"previously , chinese consumers absolutely preferred cash as a payment method , but cash is now replaced by an escrow system initiated mainly by alipay as of ."
"alibaba has tried to build relational legitimacy by systemizing the communications between sellers and buyers ( the key stakeholders for relational legitimacy ) as well as among buyers in a more transparent and reliable way , which provides accurate and effective information .","alibaba has also taken more care of consumers , who have traditionally borne the risks of business transactions ."
"in our interviews , alibaba made it clear that those who had higher demands for e - commerce were not the rich people but lower - income classes or rural residents .","as the relevant infrastructure and logistics industry improved , however , alibaba subsequently included upper - income society into the stakeholder group ."
"while alibaba accompanied alipay , eachnet did not bring paypal , which caused a failure in guaranteeing the transaction safety .",absence of the escrow system deeply hindered the development of its ecommerce business as buyers and sellers could not establish trust .
"paipai made some efforts to establish supporting system for the advertisement or the online shop design to the merchants , but the efforts were not salient .","the communications system between platform , merchants and buyers are not well established ."
"the alibaba eerience clearly demonstrates that standards , even with government endorsement , should not condescend to the social aspects .",this research elains why some standards survive in the market and others do not when there are multiple standards in competition .
"although scholars have studied the role of legitimacy in the acceptance of multinational enterprises , new products , and institutional arrangements ( peng , ; rao , ; ward et al . , ) , platform acceptance was separately considered in technology management .","first , this study contributes to the linking of institutional theory ( legitimacy building ) and technology management ( platform acceptance ) ."
"although some studies have investigated e - commerce technology acceptance ( klopping and mckinney , ) , the understanding of e - commerce in the context of socio - technical systems is still insufficient .","we find that technology and platform acceptance , which are in the domain of technical and social systems , respectively , support industrial evolution ."
china ' s e - commerce mainstream platform business models have moved from b2b to c2c and then to b2c .,we illustrate the basis on which this trajectory has been constructed by eloring the platform evolution mechanism .
the results highlight that e - commerce companies should consider the bigger picture of platform building rather than focus on the usual business goals .,"moreover , our study provides managerial implications and its findings would provide practical guidance to industrial practitioners and policy makers ."
alibaba adopts its low platform fee strategy to attract and nurture sellers as compared with other leading international e - commerce platform companies .,relational legitimacy provides insights that competing against the platform becomes more important than competing against firms .
"as per policy of health ministry , the anti - hbc and anti - hbs positive blood units were utilized and the isolated anti - hbc blood units were rejected .","at this tertiary care centre of saudi arabia out of blood units collected during - 2003 , isolated anti - hbc positivity was % and hbsag positivity %, where as % of the blood units were anti - hbc and anti - hbs positive ."
here i shall mention the most valuable properties of this ib vaccine so far known to underline the hypothesis that it may be beneficial in people at risk from sars coronavirus .,"in a review article on avian infectious bronchitis ( ib ) vaccine strain h , various characteristics of this vaccine were outlined ."
"stavrinides and guttman concluded recently that the sars coronavirus is mammalian - like through the replicase protein , and avian - like through the m and n proteins .",it was concluded that the sars coronavirus is a novel coronavirus .
"therefore , before starting the eeriment titration of the challenge virus in these monkeys should be performed in order to determine the amount of virus , which will produce clinical symptoms in not more than % of the infected animals .","it is very important to establish the amount of challenge virus , which will provoke disease and eventually death ."
the application of the ib vaccine strain h in humans should be restricted and only hcws and other persons at risk but not yet showing any signs of the disease will be considered as candidates for vaccination .,"if clinical symptoms are observed other methods of treatment , such as administration of alpha if are recommended ."
"tein gene of sars coronavirus ( sars - cov ) was cloned and characterized , and shortly thereafter , angiotensinconverting enzyme ( ace2 ) was shown to be its functional receptor .",identification of ace2 as a receptor for sars - cov will likely contribute to the development of antivirals and vaccines .
"the majority of enveloped viruses , i . e . viruses surrounded by a lipid bilayer derived from the host cell inner or outer membranes , achieve cellular entry by docking to specific membrane proteins that extend into the extracellular space .","these highly diverse receptors usually react with viral fusion proteins called peplomers or spikes , which protrude from the viral surface ."
"the s2 domain contains amphipathic heptad repeats , which are predicted to engage in coiled - coil formation during cell - virus fusion .",coronaviral spikes are type i membrane proteins which contain an n - terminal receptor - binding ( s1 ) and a c - terminal membrane fusion ( s2 ) domain .
"recently , another human coronarvirus , designated hcov - bl63 , was isolated from an infant suffering from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis .",it remains to be seen whether this virus also utilizes apn as a cell - entry receptor .
toroviruses may have acquired this gene by a recombination event in the past .,"replication is special in that mrna is synthesized from ' core promoters ' of a negative stranded rna template and not by fusion of a common leader sequence with subgenomic transcripts as in the coronaviruses ( snijder and horzinek , ) ."
"in a recent survey in canada of faeces from children with diarrhoea , rotavirus was found in %, adenovirus in %, torovirus in %, norwalk like viruses in %, and astroviruses and sapporo - like viruses each in tess than % ( waters et al . , ) .","this suggested that toroviruses are not a very frequent , but a consistent cause of diarrhoea in humans ( koopmans et al . , ; waters et al . , ) ."
"they comprise icosahedral , single shelled , non - enveloped particles which contain segments of double stranded rna as their genome .","picobirnaviruses are related to , but not recognized yet as , members of the birnaviridae family ( leong et al . , ) ."
"they were detected in children with diarrhoea and in several animal species ( asymptomatic ) ( pereira , ; ludert et al . , ; gallimore et al . , gallimore et al . , , .","recently they were found in the faeces of hiv - infected patients with diarrhoea more frequently than in hiv - infected patients without diarrhoea ( grohmann et al . , ; giordano et al . , ) , but a virusspecific immune response was not measurable ( grohmann et al . , ) ."
"the genus enterovirus of the picornaviridae family contains a large number of species [ polioviruses of types - 3 , coackieviruses of groups a ( 24 types ) and b ( 6 types ) and echoviruses ( > 70 types ) , melnick , ] .","enteroviruses consist of an almost featureless capsid of - 30 nm diameter containing protomers , each possessing surface proteins , vp1 , vp2 , vp3 , and , in most viruses , an internal capsid protein , vp4 ."
"all enteroviruses infect man via the gastrointestinal tract where they have their first site of replication , probably in lymphoid tissues of the pharynx and gut .",usually enteroviruses are excreted in the stool for several weeks after infection but can also be isolated easily from the pharynx .
"its genome has recently been cloned and sequenced ( yamashita et al . , ) , and it is hoped that the epidemiology of this virus will be further clarified with the availability of specific molecular reagents .","it has also been found as a cause of traveller ' s diarrhoea ( yamashita et al . , ) ."
"the infection is symptomless for a long time , but then severe , generalised secondary infections appear ( caused by other viruses , bacteria , fungi or protozoa ) which are generally lethal .","its replication ( for details see freed and martin , ) damages the functions of infected cells before they are destroyed ."
"coronavirus is another genus of the coronaviridae family ( enjuanes et al . , ) .","the particles are - 160 nm is diameter , enveloped and possess a genome of linear ."
the anti - helminthic niclosamide has been shown to have activity against a laboratory strain of mtb in liquid culture while bacteriostatic activity against non - replicating m . abscessus was also recently described .,"there are several other clinical challenges for treatment of co - infected patients including : eense , pill burden , toxicity , and malabsorption that further necessitate the search for new drugs that may be effective against both pathogens simultaneously ."
"hiv infection increases susceptibility to new infection , or re - infection , with mtb and increased risk of latent tuberculosis infection ( ltbi ) reactivation .","tb is now the leading cause of infectious disease related death world - wide , as well as the leading cause of death in people living with hiv ( plwh ) ."
these results support further investigations of niclosamide as a therapeutic for mixed infections including mtb and hiv .,our findings further indicate that inhibition of hiv replication occurs post - integration via effects on pro - virus transcription .
"the following reagent was obtained through the nih aids reagent program , division of aids , niaid , nih : j - lat full length cells ( 6.3 ) from dr . eric verdin ( cat ) j - lat cells are a jurkat t cell line infected with hiv env / gfp , and eress gfp when hiv proviral transcription occurs .","buffy coats used in the isolation of monocytes for the culture of monocytederived macrophages ( mdm ) were purchased from the gulf coast blood center in houston , tx ."
peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from pbmcs by overnight adherence in ml tissue culture flasks as described .,monocytes were dissociated with gibco dissociation media and counted on a hemacytometer using trypan blue to assess viability .
pvdf membranes were coomassie blue stained before antibody probing to ensure equal loading .,"g of protein were loaded per well , separated on a - 20% acrylamide gel ( biorad ) and transferred to pvdf ."
semi - quantitative rt - pcr was performed to detect hiv ltr as previously described using itaq sybr green master mix ( biorad ) on a lightcycler instrument ( biorad ) and normalized to the gapdh housekeeping gene .,"rna was isolated using a quick - rna kit ( zymo ) , treated with dnase i , and cdna synthesized with an iscript cdna kit ( biorad ) ."

"in order to determine activity against virulent clinical isolates of mycobacteria , we incubated liquid cultures of m . bovis bcg ( control ) and m . tb beijing in the presence of media alone , common antimycobacterial drugs rifampicin ( rif , m ) , isoniazid ( inh , 5 nm ) , or increasing concentrations of niclosamide from to m ( fig .",it has been previously demonstrated that niclosamide can inhibit the growth of h37rv in h9 liquid culture .
"it is also possible that niclosamide acts in other ways to affect the level of pro - viral transcripts , such as nuclear entrapment or increased degradation of viral rnas .","while additional studies will be needed to differentiate between these possible mechanisms , further eloration of niclosamide or its derivatives may potentially lead to a new class of anti - retroviral drugs in general as well as new approaches to complement tb chemotherapy ."
"to determine if niclosamide could be effective in primary cells and in a relevant coinfection model , we employed an in vitro coinfection system .",mdm were infected with hiv jr - csf and m . bovis bcg eressing the fluorochrome tdtomato in the presence or absence of 5 m niclosamide and assayed for hiv protein products and mycobacteria via flow cytometry .
"it also raises the possibility of new drug for treatment of either infection , to which resistance has not yet arisen in either pathogen .","this would reduce the challenges of adverse drug interactions encountered when trying to treat patients with this common , but deadly co - infection ."
"cells were harvested , stained with a live / dead marker , fixed and permeabilized , then stained with an anti - hivp24 - fitc antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry .",macrophages were then cultured in the presence or absence of 5 m niclosamide for days .
the inhibitory effect of ammonium ion is common to most animal cells .,ammonium ion inhibits not only cell growth but also product formation such as interferon and vaccine .
"the optimum operation variables such as multiplicity of infection ( moi ) , infection time , and harvest time was investigated before the in situ removal system was applied .","the optimum operation variables for pedv vaccine production in a spinner culture were moi of 1 cell , infection time of h and harvest time of h . the optimum time for zeolite addition to ml spinner flask in terms of volumetric virus productivity and specific virus productivity were h and h , respectively ."
", , the severity of illness partly depends on the levels of pre - existing antibody to the infecting strains , age of the individual , and presence of chronic underlying disease .","h2 , infection confers long - term strain - specific immunity , but the frequent changes in surface antigens of the influenza viruses result in life - long susceptibility to additional infections ."

the viral respiratory syndromes are artificial categories taken from a continuum of illness ranging from asymptomatic infection to life - threatening pneumonia .,"although artificial , these categories do provide a convenient way to discuss the causative agents and the general epidemiologic features of viral respiratory disease from a clinical perspective ."
", , uri is characterized by nasal discharge , nasal obstruction , sneezing , sore throat , and cough with or without fever .",the illness usually lasts to days but can persist for several weeks or longer .
", , uri is characterized by nasal discharge , nasal obstruction , sneezing , sore throat , and cough with or without fever .","viral upper respiratory tract illness ( uri ) , or the common cold , is probably the most common human infection and is a major cause of morbidity , visits to physicians , and time lost from work in the united states ."
"infection with rhinoviruses and coronaviruses is relatively less common in children , and infection with respiratory syncytial virus , parainfluenza viruses , and adenoviruses is more common .",these viruses may also cause a significant portion of the uri of unknown etiology since they are more difficult to identify than some of the other viruses .

"influenza viruses are the most common cause of the influenza syndrome in civilian populations , although adenoviruses have been a major cause in military training camps .",", other respiratory viruses , including coronavirus , 126 have also been implicated in the influenza syndrome ( see table ) ."
"although the usual clinical features of the pharyngitis and the accompanying symptoms are different among the agents , the overlap in the clinical picture makes it impossible to determine the causative agent on clinical grounds alone .","symptoms of tracheobronchitis ( cough and eectoration ) without pneumonia are commonly associated with viral respiratory infections , especially with influenza and parainfluenza viruses , respiratory syncytial vi - group of etiologic agents ( see table ) ."

"generally , viral isolation is more sensitive than antigen detection but takes longer and is more eensive .","viral isolation , on the other hand , does not require specific tests for a particular virus , though some may not be detected if the appropriate cell culture is not used , and some , such as coronavirus , are almost never isolated ."
"for both viral isolation and antigen detection , a nasopharyngeal aspirate or wash is preferable to a nasopharyngeal or throat swab .","for identifying rsv , one study showed nearly a - fold increase in isolation rate with a nasopharyngeal wash colnpared with a nasopharyngeal swab ."
tests for detecting viral dna or other virus - specific components in clinical specimens are also being developed and may further improve our ability to detect viral respiratory infections .,"for antigen detection , monoclonal antibodies are likely to be commonly used as reagents since they can provide sensitivity and specificity comparable to that of animal antiserum without variability in its quality ."
"a major advantage of rapid antigen detection tests for clinical specimens is that they can be completed in one to two days , while results are still clinically useful .",serologic testing is also hampered by inconsistent antibody response after reinfection and the unavailability of screening tests for rhinoviruses and coronaviruses .
"thus , the results from one laboratory may be quite different from those of another , and the clinician should be aware of the sensitivity and specificity of the tests as performed in the laboratory he or she uses .","for all tests the sensitivity and specificity depend on the skill of the person performing the test , especially for fa , and the quality of the reagents ."

", it is hoped that by simulating natural infection , live vaccines will be more effective than inactivated ones .",considerable research has been devoted to the development of live attenuated influenza vaccines that are administered intranasally .
inactivated vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus were found not to be protective and may have predisposed recipients to more severe illness during subsequent natural infection .,"however , infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus are major health problems in infants and young children worldwide , and considerable effort is being made to develop vaccines for this age group ."
"such individuals include the elderly and those with certain chronic underlying diseases , including acquired or congenital heart disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , renal impairment , diabetes mellitus , severe anemia , and conditions that compromise the immune system .","the licensed influenza vaccine consists of inactivated virus , and use of the vaccine has been strongly recommended only for individuals at greatest risk of serious pulmonary complications or death following influenza ."
inactivated vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus were found not to be protective and may have predisposed recipients to more severe illness during subsequent natural infection .,live attenuated vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus are currently being evaluated for parenteral and intranasal administration .

"for determination of the analytical reactivity , clinical specimens ( combined nose and throat swabs in glucose - lactalbumin - yeast viral transport medium [ gly ] ) containing different influenza viruses with a variety of viral loads or with inconsistent qrt - pcr results , several influenza virus isolates in different dilutions in gly and the quality control for molecular diagnostics ( qcmd ) influenza virus haemagglutinin typing external quality assessment ( eqa ) panel consisting of various dilutions of influenza virus isolates in virus transport medium were used ( table ) .","for determination of the analytical specificity , a respiratory panel and negative specimens were used ( table ) ."
"in addition , four virus negative specimens were also negative in the ert flu a panel tests .",none of the specimens of the respiratory panel containing viruses other than influenza a virus and bacteria commonly detected in specimens from patients with influenza - like illness were positive in the ert flu a panel tests ( table ) .
both qrt - pcr and ert flu a panel matrix tests performed similar for all three viruses with an analytical sensitivity of about - 5000 viral particles per ml ( fig .,) shown in table were specimens with lowest viral load tested for a given subtype ; ct values in the qrt - pcr matrix assay greater than .
with none of the freeze - thawed clinical specimens in gly analysed in this study we noticed any reduced performance due to clogging of the cartridge .,no significant differences were found between the ert flu a panel and the qrt - pcr with three original clinical specimens diluted : 10 in gly or utm and subsequently freeze - thawed ( fig .

"the surface area of the intestinal epithelium is largely amplified ( about - fold in the small intestine ) by the presence of folds , villi , and cell microvillar structures .","this enhances the capacity of the intestine to transport nutrients , electrolytes and water ."
"this chapter emphasizes molecular mechanisms of intestinal epithelial ion transport processes , as well as the intra - and extracellular factors involved in their regulation , as a framework for the understanding of virus - induced gastroenteritis .",many advances have been made in the understanding of intestinal electrolyte transport from the molecular to the whole - tissue level .
"the intestinal cells transport electrolytes and nutrients in a vectorial manner , generating electrochemical and osmotic gradients to drive absorption and / or secretion .",the function of the intestine as a transporting machine is guaranteed by its structural and functional asymmetry at the cellular and crypt - villus axis levels and along the gut from duodenum to distal colon .
"this paradigm has been challenged since secretory mechanisms have been observed in some villus cells ( kockerling and fromm , ; stewart and turnberg , ) , and colonic crypt cells are able to absorb na + and water in the absence of secretory stimuli naftalin et al . , ; singh et al . , ; thiagarajah et al . , ) .","it was a dogma for a long time that absorption and secretion took place in villus and crypt cells , respectively ( montrose et al . , ) ."
fructose enters the cells driven by the chemical gradient through a facilitated diffusion pathway in the apical membrane ( glut ) .,glucose and fructose exit through a facilitated diffusion pathway in the basolateral membrane ( glut2 ) .
"in oocytes eressing rabbit sglt1 , the activation of protein kinase a ( pka ) increased the maximum rate of na + / glucose cotransport by %, and the activation of protein kinase c ( pkc ) decreased the maximum rate of transport by %.",the regulation of intestinal sugar absorption via na + / glucose cotransporters occurs over short ( minutes ) or long term ( days ) .
a small fraction of peptides enters the blood crossing the basolateral membrane by h / peptide cotransport systems driven by the peptide concentration gradient .,most of the peptides entering the enterocyte are digested to free amino acids by intracellular peptidases .
the paracellular flux of c1 driven by na movement would restore electroneutrality between apical and basolateral sides .,basolateral k + channels would recycle k across the basolateral membrane .
these three mechanisms operate to effectively accumulate clintracellularly above its electrochemical equilibrium .,potassium taken by the pump and by the cotransporter exits the cell and recycles through the opening of basolateral k + channels .
"more recent evidence suggests that the na + / k + / 2 c1 - cotransporter is also subject to regulation ( haas and forbush , ) .","chloride transport is mainly regulated by the opening of apical c1 and basolateral k channels , as a result of changes in intracellular second messengers such as camp and ca + ."
"one channel can be activated by muscarinic agonists like carbachol , is activated by ca + , insensitive to ba + and blocked by clotrimazol and charibdotoxin ( devor and duffey , ; greger et al . , ; jensen et al . , ; lomax et al . , ; vandorpe et al . , ) .",functional and pharmacological characterization indicates the intervention of at least two types of basolateral k + channels involved in chloride secretion by intestinal cells .
"the activity of this cotransporter may be also regulated by insertion and retrieval of membrane transporter molecules modulated by the concentration of camp , and cytoskeletal dynamics ( d ' andrea et al . , ; hecht and koutsouris , ; karczewski and groot , ; matthews et al . , ; matthews et al . , ; matthews et al . , ) .","thus , an apical chloride efflux would indirectly stimulate basolateral chloride uptake , providing a positive feedback for secretion lytle and forbush , ; torchia et al . , ) ."
"water channels of the aquaporin family ( aqp ) have been identified in the small intestine ( aqp2 and ) and in the colon ( aqp3 , and ) , located in villus and crypt cells ( ma and verkman , ) .","a new aquaporin ( aqp10 ) was identified in human small intestine and localized in absorptive duodenal and jejunal epithelial cells ( hatakeyama et al . , ) ."
"moreover , sglt1 may couple the transport of na + and sugar to water translocation , in this way functioning as a na + / glucose / h20 cotransporter .",the physiological role of these different transporters remains to be elucidated as well as their participation in pathological processes .
"once inside the cell , virus replication usually causes cell lysis and the release of viral progeny which in turn infects neighboring cells .","the cytolytic infection often leads to villus atrophy and a decrease in the digestive and absorptive capacities of the intestine , generating a malabsorption component of diarrhea ."
"in many cases , viral diarrhea may be a multifactorial disease where impaired digestion and absorption may be the major factors , with osmotic activity , secretion and hypermotility complicating the process .","the extent of histopathological lesions often does not elain the intensity of diarrhea , suggesting that the mechanisms outlined might be a simplistic view of the process ."
"due to the clinical importance of rotavirus diarrhea and the fact that cell culture and animal models of the disease have been developed , our knowledge of the pathogenesis has greatly advanced during the past few years ( for review see estes et al . , ; estes and morris , ; lundgren and svensson , ; morris and estes , ; ruiz et al . , ; section ii , chapter of this book ) .","rotavimses infect mature enterocytes of jejunum and ileum , inducing cell lysis , which will release the new rotavirus progeny and synthesized viral proteins into the lumen of the intestine ."
"in parallel to the increase in plasma membrane permeability and cytosolic ca + concentration , there is an enhancement of er sequestered ca + stores ( brunet et al . , a ; michelangeli et al . , ; perez et al . , ) .",this effect is likely to be due to the activation of er ca pumps .
"the eression of recombinant nsp4 protein in insect cells induced an increase in cytosol ca + concentration ( tian et al . , ) .","the nonstructural protein nsp4 , eressed constitutively during rotavirus infection as well as added egenously to noninfected cells , has been implicated in disturbances of ca + homeostasis ."
it is reasonable to think that nsp4 is responsible for these effects .,"this depends on the activation of the phospholipase c - ip cascade , resulting in store depletion , which in turn may activate capacitative ca + entry ."
"these numerous modifications will lead to stimulation of secretion , diminished absorption , enhanced paracellular permeability and perhaps hypermotility which will participate in the pathogenesis of diarrhea from the early stages of the disease .","these include actions on the cytoskeleton , ionic and nutrient transport , eression of digestive enzymes and eventually cell death which will be addressed below ."
that a primary secretory component of rotavirus diarrhea might exist was first proposed based on the effect of rotavirus on ca + homeostasis of infected cells .,"the finding that the endogenous eression or the egenous addition of the nonstructural protein nsp4 is capable of increasing [ ca2 + ] i ( dong et al . , ; tian et al . , ; tian et al . , ) triggered a number of studies that lead to the hypothesis that this protein may act as a viral enterotoxin to induce secretion and diarrhea estes and morris , ; morris and estes , ) ."
"the relationship between diarrhea , ca + and nsp4 has been confirmed studying mutations in nsp4 , which are associated with altered virus virulence .",there is an association between the capacity of this protein to induce changes in intracellular ca + in ht29 cells and the induction of diarrhea by the mutated nsp4 in mice .
"nsp4 could act directly on uninfected crypt cells or mature enterocytes , or both , to induce secretion .",the target cell for the nsp4 protein action is not yet known .
"within this attractive hypothesis of direct stimulation of crypt cells , several points remain to be clarified : a ) the molecular identification of the putative ca + dependent c1 channel ; b ) the reason why carbachol is not able to stimulate this c1 - channel related to diarrhea in cftr knockout mice ; c ) the identity and localization of the putative nsp4 receptor ; d ) the correlation between the ca + dependent component of secretion and diarrhea .","in this sense , the changes in short circuit current ( ci - transport ) in isolated mucosal sheets of mice intestine induced by nsp41 ~ 4 _135 peptide or carbachol represent a small fraction of that induced by the camp dependent secretagogue , forskolin ."
newly synthesized particles would be released into the medium after cell lysis and induce new infectious lytic cycles .,"however , we should note that an alternative model for the release of rotavirus particles before lysis of caco - 2 cells in a secretion - like process has been reported ( jourdan et al . , ) ."
"if this occurred in the villus enterocyte , it would impair electroneutral nac1 absorption and na linked nutrient absorption with a consequent fluid loss and diarrhea .","the na + gradient across the membrane is collapsed early during infection due to an increase in [ na + ] j ( del castillo et al . , ) ."
the mechanism of rotavirus diarrhea may involve a generalized inhibition of na + / solute cotransport systems .,"a strong inhibition of both na + / glucose ( sglt1 ) and na + / leucine symport activities have been found in brush - border membrane vesicles isolated from rotavirus infected rabbits ( halaihel et al . , a ) ."
another mechanism that may be involved in a decrease of nutrient absorption during rotavirus infection is the reduction of digestive enzyme eression at the apical brush border membrane .,"during the course of infection of suckling mice and piglets with rotavirus , the activities of alkaline phosphatase , lactase , sucrase and maltase decreased ( collins et al . , ; davidson et al . , ; shepherd et al . , ) ."
"a decreased na + / glucose transport has been shown in isolated piglet intestines mounted in ussing chambers ( shepherd et al . , ; telch et al . , ) as well as in brush border membrane vesicles ( keljo et al . , ) .",coronavirus ( tgev ) has been used extensively to study enteritis - associated changes in nutrient and electrolyte transport .
"a number of disease states , including inflammatory and diarrheal diseases , may be caused by primary defects in epithelial barrier function ( bjarnason et al . , ) .",the role of the paracellular pathway and the integrity of the tight junction in the barrier function and fluid balance in the intestine have been long recognized .
"eeriments performed in rotavirus infected caco - 2 and / or mdck cell monolayers showed a disruption of tight junctions and decrease of transepithelial resistance ( dickman et al . , ; obert et al . , ; svensson et al . , ) .","profound changes in the permeability characteristics of the intestine of children during acute rotavirus diarrhea have been found ( stintzing et al . , ) ."
"in mdck cell monolayers , apical addition of nsp4 induced a reduction in transepithelial electrical resistance , a redistribution of filamentous actin , an increase in paracellular permeability to extracellular markers and the targeting of the tight junction associated protein zo - 1 ( tafazoli et al . , ) .",the modification of paracellular permeability might be induced by the endogenous eression of nsp4 in infected cells or released nsp4 acting as an enterotoxin on noninfected cells .
the enterotoxins produced by various bacteria induce effects on intestinal motility via an activation of the ens .,the effects of rotavirus enteritis on intestinal motility indicate that intestinal transit time is shortened .
"in addition , ischaemia induces hyperplasia [ of immature cells and hypersecretion .","according to this hypothesis , infection of villus cell by rotavirns would trigger the release of "" neuroactive / hormonal substances "" which would cause ischaemia by vasoconstriction and , in turn , villus shortening and a decrease in absorptive capacity ."
"in addition , nsp4 will alter the integrity of the tight junction ( tj ) , opening a paracellular permeability pathway and increasing secretion by solvent drag or exudation .","in parallel , released virus will infect downstream absorptive cells , leading to cell death and reduction of the absorptive surface generating an osmotic component of diarrhea ."
"as infected cells die in a calcium - mediated necrosis process , the absorptive surface is reduced further increasing the malabsorption component which is superimposed on the secretory one , resulting in a mixed type diarrhea .",the understanding of the pathogenic processes of viral diarrheas may serve as the basis for a rational approach in the design of novel therapeutic strategies and the search for new antiviral drugs .
both systems resulted in mhv variants with extended host range .,"these previously published models include a persistent infection system , and a mixed infection system ."
sequencing revealed amino acid mutations in the s gene when compared with the a59 and jhm strains that initiated the co - infection .,"the mixed infection model resulted in variant c4 , again with extended host range to human , hamster , and primate cell lines ."
"isolated recombinants contained either the full length v51 or c4 s glycoproteins ( full s recombinant ) or specific domains of the the receptor binding domain consisting of the amino terminal residues ( rbd recombinant ) , the s1 cleavage subunit ( s1 recombinant ) , all residues but the receptor binding domain ( 3 ' region recombinant ) , and the s2 cleavage subunit ( s2 recombinant ) ( figure ) .","the emergence of new viruses is a poorly understood process , but one demanding a single overlap mutation with an additional persistent infection model characterized by to further characterize the impact of the identified mutations on the host range phenotype , we utilized the targeted rna recombination system and no see ' m restriction site technology to allow for precise insertion of s gene pieces from host range variants into the a59 genetic background ."
"growth curve analysis on human cell lines hepg2 and mcf7 indicates that the determinants for host range in both model systems are encoded in the s2 region , with the phenotype presenting most clearly in the v51 recombinants .","recombinants containing the s2 region alone from v51 or c4 are capable of productively replicating in hepg2 or mcf7 cell lines , respectively ."
"on dbt cells , the rbd and s1 recombinants are hampered by cc1 in a fashion similar to a59 while s2 and ' region recombinants are fairly resistant to cc1 blockade .","the c4 full s recombinant and original c4 isolate are unable to productively infect st - ceacam1a cells , suggesting they may have lost the ability to use this receptor to initiate infection ."
"the various populations of modern humans that ventured out of africa adapted to different environments and faced a large variety of infectious agents , resulting in local adaptations of the immune system for these populations .",the evolution of mankind has constantly been influenced by the pathogens encountered .
"as a result , infectious agents have caused the eansion of alleles behind the induction of either protection or tolerance to these diseases ; heritable variations , that increased the survival to deadly infectious agents , may have been naturally selected before the hosts had the opportunity to reproduce .","natural selection driven by pathogens is probably more remarkable for those infectious agents that have been among us for a longer time , namely the causative agents of well - known diseases such as leprosy , smallpox , malaria , or tuberculosis ."
in this review we offer a novel perspective on the role of infectious diseases as agents of natural selection and as forces behind the evolutionary pressure encountered by human ancestors and modern humans in their migrations around the globe .,"with the burst of next - generation sequencing and the development of cutting - edge technologies such as transcriptomics , proteomics , and systems biology , we are starting to witness the great impact of evolutionary processes on human immunity and how the interactions between microorganisms and humans that took place millennia ago might play a fundamental role not only in the response against modern pathogenic threats , but also in the emergence of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases observed in modern populations worldwide ."

european populations present a selective adaptation of the ifn gene that allows a high production of ifn - g in infectious scenarios due to the positive selection of ifng variants + 5 1 7 3 g and + 8 7 4 t ; this suggests the existence of strong environmental pressures linked to higher ifn - g concentrations in plasma during mtb infection in european individuals relative to other populations .,"in line with this , a database meta - analysis showed that individuals eressing the + 8 7 4 t / a variant of ifng presented higher susceptibility to tuberculosis mtb infection than individuals without it , which might be considered a putative prognostic factor for the development of tuberculosis , although this remains to be robustly demonstrated ."
asian human ancestors went through the frozen waters of the bering strait in two distinct waves to colonize the american continent approximately years before the present time .,"when humans ventured out of africa , they faced different types of pathogens than the communities that stayed in the african continent ."
"five centuries ago , european settlers disembarked on the american continent , bringing a large collection of pathogens such as those causing measles , pneumonic plague , and influenza infections , which the indigenous populations had never faced before .",the indigenous populations of south america are descendants of migrating populations of north - east asians that crossed the bering strait around years ago .
such scenarios were documented when dutch colonists migrated to surinam and encountered epidemics of yellow and typhoid fever that caused a % mortality rate among settlers .,"variations in the frequencies of c3 , glo , and hla - b genes among the descendants were not likely caused by genetic drift , but rather , it has been proposed that these populations were probably selected through genetic control of survival to the epidemics ( box ) ."
"in the absence of regular pathogen challenges that require maintained modulation of the balance between inflammation and suppression of the immune response , the organism can overreact to inflammatory stimuli and trigger exacerbated responses .","for instance , descendants of african populations generally present higher susceptibility to a variety of autoimmune syndromes such as inflammation - associated carcinomas , lupus , asthma , and multiple sclerosis ( ms ) , the overall prevalence of which is up to three times higher in individuals with african ancestry relative to individuals with european ancestry ."
there are extensive differences in immune cell gene eression between americans with african and european ancestry .,"the increased proinflammatory responses observed in american individuals relative to other populations might be beneficial to combatting infections , but might also increase the chances of developing inflammatory and autoimmune disorders , which warrants further investigation ."

"for example , in a cohort of individuals with chronic wounds , a report showed that the phage pf , which coexists with pseudomonas aeruginosa in infected wounds , triggered the production of type i ifn , the inhibition of tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) production , and the suppression of phagocytosis in human primary monocytes and mouse bone marrow - derived macrophages , dampening the antibacterial response and promoting the bacterial infection .","this is the case of parasites that infect other parasites , such as bacteriophage viruses , that can influence the outcome of bacterial infections ."

"moreover , reduced eure to infectious agents can have a much wider effect than initially believed .",lack of eure to microbes in childhood can cause aberrant responses to infection and potentiate the effects of etv6 - runx1 mutations in the pathogenesis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia .
"for example , the babies of pregnant women who suffered during the early stages of pregnancy ( the effects of the dutch hunger winter in ) , years later showed reduced dna methylation marks in several genes that control metabolism and cell differentiation during development , such as igf2 , pim3 , txnip , abcg1 , pfkfb3 , and mettl8 , compared with their siblings .","this was related with higher rates of obesity , heart disease , cancer , and depression in individuals whose pregnant mothers suffered the effects of the famine ."
human immune responses have been shaped by the evolutionary pressure exerted by microorganisms and viruses throughout history .,generating a broad range of genetic variations and immune functions in different populations favors the adaptation to new environments and increases the chance of survival of the human species against potential pandemics .
to assign changes in the genetic landscape of human populations to certain diseases is an extraordinary challenge .,"of note , it is very difficult to assign certain variants , a specific role in the protection or induction of autoimmunity ."
"as novel tools , the development and refinement of methods that study large sections of the human genome , epigenome , and microbiota , will help to obtain genome - wide data in diverse human populations , allowing us to follow the evolutionary trails left from the encounters with different organisms , further unveiling the roots of human immunity .",high - throughput biotechnology and an eanding computational capacity can enable the study of global population genomics and might contribute to decoding the origin and consequences of functional changes in adaptive alleles down to the single cell level .
"however , these processes may also accelerate the spread of new epidemics , as seen in the cases of hiv infection , or more recently , sars - cov , ebola , and chikungunya viruses ; as well as the emergence of multiresistant bacteria and fungi , such as methicillin - resistant s . aureus or candida auris .","this is just the starting point to unveil the evolutionary history of the relationships between pathogens , the immune system , and humans ."

patients with isolated graft involvement have a - year survival of % compared with those patients with ptld extending beyond the allograft whose survival varied between % and % ( weikert and blumberg ) .,outcomes with ptld in renal transplant patients vary according to the site involved .
hsv may cause primary infection following which the virus remains latent in the sensory nerve ganglia or more commonly causes reactivation infection .,hsv may be seen as early as in the first posttransplant month in the absence of prophylaxis .
"treatment includes reduction in immunosuppression and ganciclovir , but cidofovir and foscarnet have also been utilized ( green et al .",the diagnosis of hhv and hhv is made by tissue immunohistochemistry or nat testing of peripheral blood lymphocytes .
bk polyomavirus ( bkv ) and jc polyomavirus ( jcv ) belong to the family polyomaviridae .,bkv is responsible for causing polyomavirus associated nephropathy ( pvan ) in % of cases and jcv in less than % of the cases .
"diagnosis of bkv includes the use of viral load assays ( blood , urine ) , detection of viral cytopathic effect ( decoy cells ) , nat , bkv - specific antibody , or histopathology ( hariharan ) .","kdigo guidelines recommend screening all renal transplant recipients for bkv with quantitative plasma nat at least monthly for the first - 6 months after transplantation , then every months until the end of the first posttransplant year , whenever there is an unelained rise in serum creatinine , and after treatment for acute rejection ."
approximately - 10% of patients with a history of hbv prior to transplant will reactivate posttransplant ( weikert and blumberg ) .,serial monitoring of hbv dna every - 6 months is required after transplantation as liver enzyme levels do not reflect infection status and elevated viral loads suggest resistance to therapy ( levitsky et al .
patients with a sustained virologic response to pretransplant treatment have a reduced risk for hcv recurrence and decreased posttransplant gn ( dom nguez - gil and morales ) .,options for treatment include interferon / peginterferon alone or in combination with ribavirin .
influenza vaccination is recommended prior to transplant and yearly following transplant .,prevention involves hand hygiene and the use of droplet precautions for those suspected of having infection .
west nile virus has also been reported in transplant recipients with a high incidence of neuroinvasive disease and poor outcomes .,fatal cases of dengue have been reported within the first month following renal transplant ( waggoner and deresinski ) .
"common bacterial pathogens for these infections are gram - negative organisms , including multidrug resistant bacteria ; gram positive organisms , including methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) , and vancomycin - resistant entercococci ( vre ) , as well as organisms more typically seen in immunocompromised patients such as listeria .","bacterial pneumonia , postoperative wound infections , and bacteremia or sepsis , although less common , also prolong or lead to rehospitalizations after transplantation ( karuthu and blumberg ) ."
typically it is given at a dose of mg trimethoprim and mg of sulfamethoxazole daily for - 12 months ( kdigo ) .,trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole reduces the risk of uti and bacteremia ( karuthu and blumberg ; patel and paya ) .
treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in the renal transplant recipient is controversial and is not routinely recommended ( coussement and abramowicz ) .,"although not well studied , since utis in renal transplant patients are complicated , - 14 days of antibiotics is a typical duration ."
"hospital - acquired pneumonia due to resistant pathogens , such as mrsa , and extended spectrum beta lactamase ( esbl ) or carbapenemresistant ( cre ) gram - negative organisms are increasing in incidence and sometimes require nephrotoxic agents for treatment .","occurring early in the posttransplant period , cmv infection and rejection treatment with antilymphocyte preparations increase the pneumonia risk ."
"other sites of infection include bacteremia , pneumonia , endophthalmitis , and septic arthritis .",gram staining has a low sensitivity and may be negative or reveal gram positive bacilli which may be confused with diphtheroids .
"laryngeal , meningeal , skeletal , cutaneous , intestinal , and renal infections are examples of extra - pulmonary disease .",extra - pulmonary sites of infection and disseminated disease occur in about a third of cases ( karuthu and blumberg ) .
"prophylaxis with isoniazid or rifampin should be offered to patients prior to transplantation with a history of inadequately treated tb , an abnormal chest x - ray suggestive of prior tb eure , a positive ppd or ifn gamma assay , contact with someone with active tb , or a kidney from a ppd - positive donor in order to minimize reactivation disease after transplantation ( khoury and brennan ) .","screening prior to transplant should include a history regarding prior eures , and treatment for tb , as well as a chest x - ray and urine afb culture ."
"rifampin , in particular , decreases cyclosporine levels and increases the risk for rejection .",special attention to drug toxicities and interactions with immunosuppressive agents is required .
the treatment of choice is high dose trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole for days with corticosteroids in hypoxic patients ( partial pressure of oxygen of < 70 mmhg on room air ) tapered over days .,atovaquone or clindamycin plus pyrimethamine are alternative agents ( martin and fishman ) .
"for several decades , mouse monoclonal antibodies were isolated using the hybridoma technology .","however , the therapeutic application of these antibodies was limited by induction of anti - mouse antibodies and autoreactivity ."
implementation of this technique made possible the isolation of cells specific for the cd4binding sites that were used in eression cloning .,peripheral blood b cells were stained with both a resurfaced core env ( rsc3 ) and a rsc with a point mutation in the cd4 - binding site .
the genes encoding ig were then cloned from wells with neutralizing activity .,"in that study , memory b cells were sorted , plated at a density of cells per well , eanded in vitro with the addition of feeder cells and conditioned medium generated from mitogen - stimulated human t cells , and then the supernatants were screened for neutralization using a highthroughput technique ."
"this approach also enables the isolation of cells with low eression levels of surface igg , such as plasmablasts .","cells are then stimulated to proliferate and produce igg by culturing with cd40l - eressing feeder cells and il - 2 , as well as il - 21 , a potent inducer of antibodysecreting plasma cells ."
"at the end of this protocol , supernatants may be collected for their use in a microneutralization assay or screening for other desired functions .","for a robotic setup , - 80 plates may be used , depending on the yield of b cells from the pbmc sample ."

"critical step instead of positive selection of cd19 + igg + b cells , this protocol implements a negative selection method , and it isolates the cd19 + igm iga igd memory b cells .",staining b cells with anti - human igg antibody may result in some activation of b cells and a decrease in cell viability during the d of culture .
partial evaporation of medium in the inner wells can negatively affect b cell growth and survival .,critical step adding the sterile dh o in the outer wells will diminish evaporation from the inner culture wells .
"in contrast , after d , the cultures are eected to die off .","critical step the duration of the incubation is extremely important , as incubating the plates for less than d may result in insufficient accumulation of igg in the supernatants ."
"critical step to avoid disturbing the b cells , place the tips as far down into the wells as possible .","a suitable approach to this task is to touch the bottom lightly , move the tips up slightly and then pull up the supernatants slowly to avoid aspirating b cells before dispensing into new plates ."

critical step take care not to touch the wells with the pipette tips to avoid well - to - well b cell contamination ; change the tips when necessary .,"if robotics are being used , a ' blowout and tip touch ' command can be programmed after the dispense command ."
this protocol enables researchers to isolate peripheral blood b cells and study the b cell repertoire .,"figure shows an overview of the stages involved in the approach described herein , from b cell microculture to re - eression of igg genes ."
this report represents the third description of this bacterium and the first in an animal species other than the grey seal ( halichoerus grypus ) .,it also shows that s . halichoeri can be associated with a pathological process characterized by granulomatous inflammation and resembling tuberculosis .
"the badger plays a role in the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis ( tb ) in great britain , with a high percentage of badgers having tb lesions ( corner et al . , ) .","only canine distemper virus infection seems to be an important cause of death in this species ( origgi et al . , ) ."
"in the present study , we report the isolation and phylogenetic identification of streptococcus halichoeri from a badger with pyogranulomatous pleuropneumonia initially diagnosed as tb .","pyogranulomatous inflammation can be associated with several pathogens including mycobacterium spp . , nocardia spp . , actinomyces spp . , fungi or the pyogranulomatous form of coronavirus infection ( gallagher and clifton - hadley , ; caswell and williams , ; graham et al . , ) ."
a superficial abrasion in the back and eroded claws were the only external lesions observed .,"clinical examination revealed good body condition , with a body weight of 05 kg ."
"sequencing of the s rrna gene has become the new ' gold standard ' for defining species and genus ( clarridge , ) .",the identification of s . halichoeri was only achieved after molecular studies .
"the occurrence of s . halichoeri in the european badger and the grey seal , two species with a very different way of life , is an interesting finding .","s . halichoeri was first reported in uk grey seals ( halichoerus grypus ) with skin wounds ( lawson et al . , ) and , very recently , from a man with empyema ( foo and chan , ) ."
"s . halichoeri infection might be underdiagnosed due to difficulties in identification by traditional techniques ( foo and chan , ) .","in the present case sequencing of the s rrna gene permitted identification of this species , although routine techniques failed in the identification ."
"other routes include haematogenous spread and , less often , bite wounds and perforation of the oesophagus or reticulum ( caswell and williams , ) .","in the present case , no external injuries suggesting fighting or accidents during trapping were observed and the origin was suspected to be the aspiration of oropharyngeal flora ."
"interestingly , the isolation from a man with empyema suggests that this streptococcal species might be associated mainly with suppurative lesions of the respiratory system .",it also emphasizes that molecular techniques may be needed for a final identification of some bacterial species and that more studies are needed in wildlife to demonstrate their potential role as reservoirs of both known and unknown pathogens .
recent advances in understanding virion assembly have uncovered commonalities among distantly related members of this family .,"viruses of the flaviviridae family , including hepatitis c , dengue , and bovine viral diarrhoea , are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide ."
"the genus flavivirus includes vector - borne disease agents such as yellow fever virus ( yfv ) , dengue virus ( den ) , and west nile virus ( wnv ) .","these individuals are at risk of developing cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma and extrahepatic disease ."
"structural proteins , which comprise the virion , consist of core ( capsid in flaviviruses , c ) and the envelope glycoproteins .","most of the nonstructural proteins associate to form the replicase complex , which catalyzes rna accumulation in close association with modified cytoplasmic membranes , 3,4 ."
"in contrast , hcv genomes have been extremely difficult to propagate in culture .","emergent mutations and adapted cell lines were able to coax modest levels of rna replication , but failed to produce progeny virions , ."
the enveloped virions of the flaviviridae are thought to arise by budding of the c protein and associated genomic rna into endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) - derived membranes that are studded with virus envelope glycoproteins ( fig ) .,"although morphogenesis is eected to commence by binding of c to rna , a packaging signal has not been identified for any member of the flaviviridae ."
"despite undergoing low - ph dependent entry , hcv and bvdv particles are acid resistant , indicating that unknown factors during uptake , rather than during egress , prime the envelope proteins for fusion , .","although hcv virions are infectious soon after they are formed , they undergo physical modification during egress , decreasing in density as they pass through the secretory pathway ."
"most nonstructural proteins have essential roles in replication , and it was long thought that these replicase proteins were responsible solely for catalyzing the accumulation of genomic rna molecules that could subsequently be packaged by the structural proteins .","this canonical division of labour was initially supported by the ability of subgenomes that lack the structural region to efficiently undergo rna synthesis , , , ."
"incomplete processing of p7 by signal peptidase results in an accumulation of uncleaved e2 - p7 , an envelope protein precursor that might be incorporated into virions as a minor component , , , , .","this fusion protein , however , is not essential for bvdv or hcv infectivity , and neither p7 nor e2 - p7 has been detected in pestivirus particles ; studies of hcv virions are ongoing ."
"hcv and bvdv p7 proteins oligomerize into ion conductive pores in various artificial systems , , , .","similarities have been noted between p7 and viroporins , a class of small , hydrophobic , viral proteins that have ion channel activity in vitro , and are involved in enhancing infectivity ( box ) , , ."
viroporins are an eanding group of small ( 60 - 100 residue ) hydrophobic viral proteins that demonstrate oligomerization and membrane permeablization activities in vitro and in cell - based artificial systems .,"viroporins , which can be incorporated in or excluded from the virion , are important for the infectivity of many diverse viruses ( reviewed in ) ."
m2 is a homotetrameric integral membrane protein that is present in the virus envelope in small amounts .,"a strict correlation between ion channel activity and an in vivo mechanism of action has , however , been demonstrated for the influenza a virus viroporin , m2 ( reviewed in , , ) ."
"this concordance of evidence has established that ion conduction by m2 is essential for influenza a virus propagation , .","during virus entry , m2 in the virion acidifies the particle interior to facilitate genome uncoating ."
"vpu is an integral membrane protein that is excluded from virus particles and accomplishes two distinct roles in hiv - 1 infectivity by interactions with host factors ( reviewed in , , ) .","in contrast , the hiv - 1 viroporin vpu does not seem to invoke an in vivo ion channel activity ."
"it is not known whether these viroporins function by conducting ions , by interacting with host proteins , or by additional undefined mechanisms .","as more is uncovered about the roles of small hydrophobic proteins in virus assembly and infectivity , the focus will likely shift from their similar behaviour in vitro to their diverse mechanisms in vivo , and the classification of viroporin may diverge into functionally defined subsets ."
this small protein might therefore influence several steps of infectious virus production ; indeed multiple roles have been reported for other viroporins .,"deletion of p7 from either bvdv or hcv blocks an early event in virus assembly , before the formation of infectious intracellular particles , , , while mutations in the hcv p7 cytosolic loop seem to decrease virion release ."
"this function requires at least the protease domain of ns2 , but not its catalytic activity , nor the presence of the uncleaved ns2 - 3 precursor .","in contrast , pestivirus ns2 functions only within the context of uncleaved ns2 - 3 , 58 ; the post - cleavage form of ns2 does not appear to play any role for pestivirus growth in cell culture ."
"these results hint that ns2 might form multiple functional associations , including interactions with p7 , as well as possible independent connections with replicase proteins , such as ns3 , .","specifically , genotypic matching of the amino terminal helix of ns2 , p7 , and the structural proteins , coupled with pairing of the remainder of ns2 and the replicase proteins led to optimal infectivity , 63 ."
"mutation of k190 did not affect subviral particle secretion , suggesting that ns2a plays an important role in the incorporation of genomic rna into the budding virion .","residues in ns2a ( i59 and t149 ) have also been implicated in the production of infectious kunjin virus ( kun ) , ."
"these findings suggest that , similar to hcv and the pestiviruses , physical associations between the multifunctional ns3 enzyme and an upstream membrane associated protein are essential for infectious flavivirus morphogenesis .","interestingly , second - site changes in the helicase domain of ns3 were found to suppress the assembly defect caused by mutation of the ns2a cleavage site ."
"inspection of c protein sequences from the genera pestivirus and hepacivirus revealed the presence of conserved ns3 protease recognition sites in the corresponding membrane anchors , .","subsequently , however , it was found that a host enzyme , signal peptide peptidase , processed both proteins , ."
"for a minimally infectious intergenotypic chimaera , titres were specifically increased by the emergence of a point mutation in the ns3 helicase domain .","ns3 has also been implicated in the production of hcv progeny , as adaptive mutations in this region have been found to augment infectious titres of viruses passaged in cell culture , ."
it remains to be tested whether the emerging role for hcv ns3 in progeny virus production will include a requirement for ns4a .,"additional functions of ns3 in assembly and infectivity , however , do not require cis - encoded ns2b ."
"the finding that hyperphosphorylation inhibited the ability of ns5a to bind an essential cellular component of the replicase , hvap - a , suggested that this modification might serve as a switch to break apart the replication complex and allow infectious virus assembly to begin , .","a regulatory role for ns5a phosphorylation has long been suspected , and was supported by observations that adaptive mutations , engineered mutations , or kinase inhibitors that decrease hyperphosphorylation increase rna replication but abolish hcv infectivity in chimpanzees ."
"this evidence , along with the finding that the serine to aspartic acid change slightly decreased rna replication , suggested that ckii - dependent phosphorylation of ns5a s457 might mediate a switch between replication and assembly .","the aspartic acid mutant , but not the wild - type genome , produced normal levels of infectious virus in the presence of casein kinase ii ( ckii ) inhibitors ."
"hepatocytes are among the few cell types that secrete lipoproteins , suggesting that utilization of this pathway may dictate the highly restricted tropism of this virus .","coupling of replication and virion formation at membranous intracellular structures might be envisioned to limit the propagation of defective genomes , and may be essential in the context of the highly error - prone rdrp activities ."
"nonstructural factors might be eected to form transient physical interactions with virion components in order to orchestrate their assembly , indeed it is possible that replicase proteins are incorporated into virus particles at levels below the current limits of detection .","flavivirus ns3 is known to interact with c , as it cleaves the hydrophobic anchor from this structural protein ."
"while the formation of an infectious virus certainly requires concerted action by the structural proteins , evidence highlighted here underscores the importance of nonstructural proteins in this complex process .","all flaviviridae seem to share some common requirements for infectious virus production : coordination of the multifunctional ns3 protein with upstream hydrophobic sequences , and the coupling of replication to assembly through the functions of a replicase phosphoprotein and the rdrp ."
virions then transit from the er lumen to the cell surface via the secretory pathway .,"hepacivirus morphogenesis is believed to take place in association with membrane - apposed lipid droplets , fatty deposits at which replication complexes also accumulate ."
the blood supply is remarkably safe with the risk of major pathogens such as hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) and hiv now reduced to less than one transmission per to million eures .,"considerable effort and resources have been invested in this arena , but currently no single technique is effective for inactivation of both liquid and cellular blood products and toxicity issues have not been completely resolved ."
these agents traverse all tanomic classifications of infectious agents and cause a diverse constellation of illnesses .,table summarizes the major proven or suspected emerging transfusion - transmitted agents .
these numbers may underestimate true infections because some remain undetected and others remain unreported .,transfusiontransmitted malaria remains a risk because latent infection with p falciparum can persist on average for to years and considerably longer periods have been described .
"both antibody and nucleic acid detection strategies are feasible and under development , but they would have a very high cost - benefit ratio , and the former might have low specificity and sensitivity .",no blood donor screening assay for malaria is currently licensed in the united states .
"immigrants , refugees , and citizens or other residents of endemic countries are deferred for years from the time they departed the endemic area provided that they have been free of symptoms to suggest malarial infection ; persons with a history of malaria are deferred for years after symptoms are no longer present .",these deferral periods are based on cdc data indicating that % of malaria cases in travelers occur within year of leaving the risk area and that % of cases in permanent residents of endemic areas occur within years of leaving the endemic area .
"the primary mammalian reservoir is the white - footed mouse , but the tick may also be transported by deer .","b microti has a restricted , but eanding geographic range in the united states ; it is largely confined to northeastern coastal areas and parts of the upper midwest , including minnesota and wisconsin ."
"several reports of b microti in blood donors have been published , with rates as high as % ( five of positive ) on shelter island , ny .","in the northeast united states , the seroprevalence of b microti reportedly ranges from % in the general population of connecticut to % in patients with lyme disease ."
"however , conditions favoring natural transmission to humans are generally confined to parts of latin america , because of the high prevalence of infection among feral and domestic animals and the vector insect ' s tendency to live in cracks and fissures and roofs of substandard housing .",the parasite occurs in the continental americas between latitude s and n .
"acute disease is generally mild and treatable using the eerimental drugs nifurtimox and benznizadole ; however , both drugs have relatively serious side - effects .","efforts to identify transfusion transmission by lookback or by evaluation of transfused patients have not revealed additional cases , so the risk of infection may not be as high as is suggested by seroprevalence rates ."
parasites may be visualized in the blood or in infected tissue .,tests for antibodies to t cruzi are available commercially or from reference laboratories .
chagas blood screening assays will likely be employed once they are licensed .,a history of birth or prolonged travel in endemic areas is not adequately specific and would decimate the blood supply in some locations .
"wnv primarily infects numer - ous species of birds , which act as the amplifying host .","wnv is an enveloped , single - stranded rna flavivirus in the japanese encephalitis group ."
tests for igm antibodies to wnv are used to establish a laboratory diagnosis in the presence of symptoms .,"however , relatively high levels of viremia in the absence of antibody rarely last more than weeks , and this is the period during which an individual might be infectious via blood transfusion ."
"infection with one strain of the virus results in an effective immune response to that strain , but second infection with a differing strain can still occur .","second infections can result in dengue hemorrhagic fever , a more serious disease with more pronounced symptoms accompanied by hemorrhage ."
"there is a possible instance of dengue transmission to a bone marrow transplant recipient in puerto rico , but it is unclear if this case truly there are no obvious interventions to manage the potential for transfusion - transmitted dengue , but nat screening tests could be developed and implemented if such intervention were necessary .","such a strategy would be preferable to the prohibition of blood collection , as implemented in northern queensland , australia as a result of the introduction of dengue into that area ."
parvovirus b19 merits discussion not because it is a newly emerging agent but because its potentially severe pathologic effects have become more apparent in the past decade with widespread use of pooled plasma components that foster its spread by transfusion .,parvovirus b19 is not inactivated by the solvent detergent method that renders pooled plasma free of the major lipid - enveloped agents .
"parvoviridae infect many insect and animal species , but only b19 has been associated with significant human disease .","parvovirus b19 , now designated erythrovirus , is a member of the parvoviridae family of small ( 19 to nm ) , nonenveloped , single - stranded dna viruses ."
"parvovirus b19 is responsible for a common , benign exanthema of children known as erythema infectiosum or fifth disease .","more significantly , b19 infects erythropoietic progenitor cells and can cause a transient , but sometimes profound , aplastic crisis in patients with underlying hemolytic syndromes , particularly sickle cell anemia and hereditary spherocytosis ; indeed , an aplastic crisis occurring in a patient with a known hemolytic anemia is preponderantly due to parvovirus b19 and sometimes , a compensated hemolytic anemia is first recognized when there is a superimposed b19induced transient aplastic crisis ."
"although the prevalence of parvovirus b19 viremia in donors has been reported to range from 3% to %, only three cases of anemia associated with blood transfusion were reported in the united states and europe over a - year period .","in the absence of antibody , viral levels can be as high as copies / ml ."
"hhv - 8 is formally a gamma herpesvirus and is enveloped , with double - stranded dna .","hhv - 8 is the etiologic agent of kaposi ' s sarcoma , accounting for its other name , kaposi ' s sarcoma - associated herpes virus ( kshv ) ."
blood from hhv - 8 - infected individuals probably has been transfused for many years without documented obvious adverse outcomes .,"hhv - 8 is cell - associated , and any potential infectivity should be reduced or eliminated by leukoreduction ."
the difference in opinion hinges on recombinatorial events that would foster respiratory spread of h5n1 similar to that seen with the annual waves of seasonal flu .,"h5n1 is anticipated to be more deadly than seasonal flu strains as it has apparently caused fatal infection in % of the small number of humans so far infected ; death rates among infants and the young are particularly high , with one study in thailand reporting % mortality among hospitalized children ."
the larger problem will be blood delivery and not blood safety .,"there are no current blood screening measures available , and even if a practical h5n1 nucleic acid assay were developed , it would have little impact : the number of viremic donors will be small , while the number of donors ineligible because of illness and the number of staff unavailable because of infection will be large ."
"variant creutzfeld jakob disease vcjd is a new prion disease of man that was first described in the united kingdom in ; it results from consuming tissues from cattle affected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) , or "" mad cow disease . ""","the causative agent is generally accepted to be a prion , a conformational variant of a naturally occurring - to - kd protein specified by the prp gene ."
"progression to death is inevitable , usually months to a year after clinical onset .","the pathophysiology is spongiform degradation of the brain , with characteristic vacuoles and so - called florid plaques ."
definitive diagnosis depends on pathologic examination of the brain with immunohistochemistry to identify the presence of the protease - resistant prion .,"there is no definitive pre - mortem diagnostic test , and a preliminary diagnosis may be made on the basis of symptoms and age ."
"careful clinical and epidemiologic studies have shown that these agents do not cause human hepatitis and , at present , they are agents searching for a disease .","finally , there is continued attention to the possibility that the hemorrhagic fever viruses will be transmissible by transfusion , a concern also extended to additional agents that might be used in bioterrorist attacks ."
one answer to this escalating array of tests and risk factor exclusions is to develop and implement strategies for universal pathogen inactivation that would not only reduce or eliminate the risk of known pathogens but would preemptively destroy any significant pathogen that might emerge in the future .,"despite extensive donor testing and detailed donor histories , there remain blood - transmissible agents for which no intervention is in place and the lingering fear that a new agent with the devastating potential of hiv will emerge in the future ."
an alternative to psoralens for the inactivation of infectious agents in platelet products is the vitamin riboflavin ( b ) in the presence of ultraviolet a .,"in both plasma and platelet products , this combination inactivates all tested viruses and bacteria , whether dna or rna , enveloped or nonenveloped , to levels below the limits of detection , with acceptable maintenance of plasma protein levels and platelet function ( but with as much as % loss of platelet yield ) ."
"thus , the relative impracticality and high cost of existing techniques should not deter continued research towards the ideal method that would inactivate nucleic acids in all blood com - ponents in a single process and provide an unprecedented level of blood safety , there will never be zero - risk in the blood supply since problems extend beyond infectious disease transmission , but the removal of almost all infectious agents in a single inactivation process is a goal too attractive to abandon without intensive eloration .","economic issues can be ameliorated because very effective inactivation would obviate the need for some of our existing blood screening assays , the requirement to introduce new assays for emerging agents , and perhaps also avoid costly leukoreduction ."
"even though the risks of such transmission are almost invariably very much lower than the risks of adverse outcomes from other medical interventions , there is a pervasive pressure to minimize or even eliminate transfusion - transmitted infections .","additionally , as discussed above , emerging agents present new threats to blood safety ."
"although there are more than candidate zikv vaccines and antibodies being developed , their use in pregnant women is still pending completion of clinical trials and fda approval .","moreover , the preventive and therapeutic strategies are virus specific , and targeted toward the virus itself , and in some cases still do not mitigate adverse perinatal outcomes ."
". increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines , including il - 1 and il - 1 , from zikv - infected cells might contribute to cell death .","our studies distinguish the role of placental inflammation during zikv - infected pregnancies , and demonstrate that maternal ira may attenuate fetal neuroinflammation and improve perinatal outcomes ."
these observations provided the foundation for our investigation of the role of il - 1 signaling in maternal zikv - induced fetal brain injury and its potential as a therapeutic target to prevent or attenuate congenital zika syndrome .,"we hypothesized that therapeutic agents that target inflammation , e . g . , through antagonism of il - 1 signaling , could mitigate placental inflammation and long - term adverse perinatal outcomes ."
"collectively , we show that ira treatment inhibits microglial activation in the perinatal brain both directly and indirectly through preservation of trophoblast invasion and vascular remodeling in the placenta .","finally , we tested the direct effects of egenous ira on perinatal microglial infection and proliferation in vitro ."
"consistent with previous studies , intrauterine zikv inoculation of immunocompetent pregnant mice at e10 ( i . e . , during the critical period of placental completion ; ref .",) caused detectable placental infection hours after inoculation ( 48 hpi ) that was similar across distinct strains of zikv ( figure a ) .
"collectively , the occurrence of these developmental abnormalities in zikv - eed pups was calculated to be % ( table ) .","these data suggest an association between placental dysfunction and adverse perinatal outcomes following in utero zikv eure , regardless of placental viral load ."
"to examine whether the placental dysregulation ( figure , b - e ) was caused by the upregulation of il - 1 ( figure b ) , we treated dams with ira hours after mock or zikv infection .","blocking il - 1 receptor signaling with ira increased zikv copies in the placenta ( p < 5 , student ' s t test , figure c ) , but not in the maternal spleen or fetal head ( figure c ) ."
"similarly , placental vascularity , as measured by the density of vimentin staining , was increased by ira administration to zikv - infected dams ( p < 5 , - way anova , figure , d and e ) .","the density of trophoblasts within the placental labyrinth was also markedly increased following ira treatment of zikv - infected dams ( p < 5 , - way anova , figure , a and b ) ."
"to determine the effects of ira on restoring neurocognitive function in neonates born to zikv - infected dams , neurological behavioral tests were performed at p5 and p9 , as previously described .","at p5 , pups born to zikv - infected dams took significantly longer to complete tasks , including negative geotaxis , cliff aversion , and surface righting , as compared with pups from mock - inoculated dams ( p < 5 , - way anova , figure a ) ."
"consistent with previous reports , iba - 1 eression was significantly greater in the brains of pups born to zikv - infected dams ( p < 5 , - way anova , figure , b and c ) , and ira administration significantly decreased the eression of iba - 1 to levels comparable to brains from pups born to uninfected dams ( p < 5 , - way anova , figure , b and c ) .","ira treatment reduced neonatal neuroinflammation as well as placental inflammation ; thus , the reduced neuroinflammation in pups might be caused by direct effects of ira treatment on the cns or indirect effects on placental inflammation and growth restriction ."
"in our murine model , intrauterine infection with live , replicating zikv caused an acute increase in placental concentrations of il - 1 , but not of other proinflammatory cytokines , that was associated with fetal demise .","although zikv infection has direct effects on fetal tissues , we show that placental inflammation is also a major contributor to adverse perinatal outcomes following in utero zikv infection ."
"in the present study , maternal zikv infection significantly delayed the invasion of trophoblasts into the mesometrial triangle of the placenta at a critical time during placental development ( i . e . , e10 . 5 ) .","insufficient trophoblast invasion and vascular remodeling are associated with many pregnancy disorders , including preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction ."
"regardless of the cell type that produces il - 1 , studies have further shown that inflammatory responses , including il - 1 secretion , are involved in placental dysregulation ( i . e . , the delay of trophoblast invasion and vascular remodeling ) .","while maternal treatment with ira did not reduce zikv replication in the placenta , it significantly preserved placental function by increasing trophoblast invasion and improving vascularity , which is necessary for maternal - fetal communication ."
we hypothesize that the continuous activation of microglia after birth may contribute to long - term neurodevelopmental deficits in the offspring .,"our data support that placental inflammation , in particular il - 1 activity , during pregnancy underlies prolonged microglia activation because maternal ira treatment reduced microglia activation in the brains of zikv - eed offspring ; therefore , neurobehavioral abnormalities in pups that were observed following placental inflammation may have been caused either by replicating viruses or nonreplicating inflammatory stimuli ."
"a significant benefit of our murine model of in utero zikv infection is that we are utilizing immunocompetent , outbred mice that mimic the genetic and immunological diversity observed in humans .",most murine models of adverse perinatal outcomes following zikv infection involve direct inoculation of neonatal mice or infection in type i ifn - deficient dams .
"these translational studies will have a significant impact on perinatal medicine by enhancing the current understanding of the role of placental inflammation in the pathogenesis of fetal congenital diseases , and by testing the feasibility and implications for in utero immunomodulatory agents .","in addition to zikv , other neurotrophic flaviviruses , including west nile virus and powassan virus , cause adverse placental and fetal outcomes when infection occurs during pregnancy ."
"stocks of zikv were generated by infecting vero cells at an moi of 1 % tissue culture infectious doses ( tcid ) per cell in dmem supplemented with % fbs , mm sodium pyruvate , u / ml penicillin , g / ml streptomycin and mm l - glutamine ( infection media [ im ] ) .","approximately hpi , the infected cell supernatant fluids were collected , clarified by centrifugation at g for minutes , and stored in aliquots at c ."
"no infectivity was detected by tcid assay after bpa treatment , verifying complete virus inactivation .",the supernatant was then incubated at c for hours to inactivate the bpa .
timed - pregnant adult ( 2 - 3 months of age ) cd - 1 mice were purchased from charles river laboratories .,animals arrived at e9 and were housed in a specific pathogen - free facility at johns hopkins university with ad libitum access to food and water .
"the injections were repeated every hours after the first treatment until tissue harvest ( half - life , - 6 hours ; ref .","beginning , , or hpi , dams were injected intraperitoneally with either ira ( kineret , or anakinra , amgen ) at mg / kg in l pbs or with the same volume of pbs ( vehicle control ) ."
"microglial cultures were infected with either zikv ( brazil strain , ) or media with or without ira .","after hours , cells were fresh frozen or fixed in % paraformaldehyde ( pfa ) for minutes and stored in pbs ."
"using a leica cm1950 cryostat , the specimens were cut at - m thickness and mounted on positively charged slides ( fischer scientific ) , followed by ihc .","the following day , the brains and placentas were washed extensively with pbs and immersed in % sucrose until saturation ."
"the cliff aversion test prompts pups to change position , escaping away from the edge .",surface righting is to test the reflex that corrects the orientation of the body when pups are taken out of its normal upright position .
the downstream sequence is read in wrong frame and translated into the wrong amino acid sequence .,"it also leads to premature termination of the process , with an encounter of a stop - codon ."
several years ago one particular frame - monitoring mechanism was suggested based on the analysis of mrna and rrna sequences .,"the mrna sequences have been shown to carry , well pronounced - base periodical motif ( ghn ) n where h stands for non - g and n for any base ."
"in what follows some new eerimental and theoretical evidence is reviewed , which provides also new details of the frame - monitoring mechanism .",this model of involvement of both mrna and rrna in the frame keeping gained substantial support recently .
"recent observation on the tertiary interaction of the bases - - 526 of the loop with the bases - 507 of the nearby bulge indicates that , perhaps , a conformational ' switch ' occurs in this region of the s rrna structure .","a - base long mrna fragment has been cross - linked to the site , as well as to the site ."
"the ' - end of the s rrna is known to be involved at the translation initiation stage , by making complementary contact with the shine - dalgarno sequence upstream from aug initiation triplet .",its involvement in elongation was first indicated by mrna sequence analysis .
"indeed , the minimal estimate of this size is given by total length of the ( nnc ) , rack with its x = bases .",this coincides with the estimated length of mrna involved in the contact with the ribosome .
"the site was found on the right side of the neck , which is close enough to the decoding site , in the base of the cleft , to be considered as its immediate neighbor .","dna hybridization electron microscopy of the small ribosomal subunits , with biotinylated dna probes , locates the two sites close to one another as well , but in different p . ositions : site on the back of the neck and site on the left side of it , rather than in the cleft ."
"the site is found in contact with mrna , several bases downstream from the triplet interacting with the decoding site .","by the same technique but with several thio - u residues in one mrn , a fragment , the cross - linking was detected of the - end of rrna to mrna few bases upstream from aug triplet in the initiation s complex [ 251 ."
the site is known as one of the key elements of the translation initiation process .,"the idea that the site , the anti - shine - dalgamo sequence , would be involved in the frame - keeping process was the most vulnerable part of the hypothesized frame - monitoring scheme ."
"remarkably , in that complementary position the framing cytosines of the site ( gaucaccuccuua ) were found in register with the first triplet positions of the new frame .",complementarity of the site to the sequence bases upstream from the translation shift site in a certain mrna construct was found crucial for the efficiency of the translational frameshifting .
"that is , there are many structural elements in the ribosome and in mrna as well as additional factors securing all together the reading frame or its change when required .",individual contributions of these ' signal ' components are different in every particular case .
"the distributional nature of the framekeeping function elains why , for example , the g - periodicity sometimes is not present .","thus , there is no necessity for the simultaneous presence of all of these ' signal ' components together in every case of the frameshifting ."
"last , but also essential , is the destabilizing contribution of non - complementary base oppositions , especially of the similar - named ones : a . a , c . c , g . g and u . u .","for the mrna - rrna contacts to be sufficiently stable in the correct frame at every stage of the - base translocations , the number of the single complementary contacts should be higher and / or the number of complementary dinucleotides should be higher and / or the number of the bad mismatches should be lower than in the other two frames ."
"indeed , if in a given set of recognition sites the normally , present signal features are underrepresented , it shoula be compensated by overrepresentation of other signa ~ elements , undetected earlier .","the compensation effects of the distributional recognition can be generally utilized for consecutive extraction of unknown signal elements from the sequence , as a signal detection and purification technique ."
for this purpose probes could be synthesized carrying simultaneously sequences complementary to two different framing sites .,"by varying positions of the complementary sequences along the probe one could , thus , determine the spatial relationships between the sb ' es in the ribosome ."
"the best designs , presumably , would be the ones that carry several such non - complementary sequences reflecting the spatial relationships between the contact sites .","the frameshifting at these loci is eected to be even more efficient if the sequences immediately downstream would contain a strong ( gcu ) , motif in a new frame ."
analysis of mrna sequences and detection of the universal pattern complementary to the site makes this site a good candidate as well .,it remains to be demonstrated directly that the two other sites make as well the complementary contacts with mrna .
"in the developing world , most of these clinical problems were either neglected or undertreated by the clinicians , perhaps due to lack of interest , understanding and knowledge and lack of appropriate training .","although the foot and ankle disorders and injuries are quite a common occurrence , these have seen a ' willful neglect ' until the recent past ."
"in the last couple of decades , the sub - specialty of foot and ankle has been growing both in the developed and developing worlds .","the recent interest in this subspeciality is reflected by an increasing number of practicing foot and ankle specialists , focused , national and international conferences , workshops , courses , regional networks and publications related to the foot and ankle conditions ."
we sincerely hope that our readership is keeping well and staying safe in these very difficult times .,we are hopeful that this special issue would provide insight into the current practice of foot and ankle problems to our readers and would also act as a useful reference for the future researchers .
"besides knowledge about the patients ' immune status , the local resistance pattern , such as the frequencies of extended spectrum betalactamase ( esbl ) - producing enterobacteriaceae and methillicin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) , is important when deciding on empirical antimicrobial therapies .","an important diagnostic principle in immunosuppressed patients is to "" go for the bug "" at the place of infection using invasive procedures , most often bronchoalveolar lavage ( bal ) and biopsies ."
"although the risk for neutropenic fever can be reduced , the effects on outcome have been variable , and its use is controversial due to the increased rates of resistance .","if antibacterial prophylaxis is to be used , it should be reserved only to high - risk patients ."

pbl influenced both the way the curriculum was developed and the process by which students ( n = ) investigated topics related to the integration of ict in business studies classrooms .,"this article reports on the design , implementation and evaluation of a module in the med ( business ) in the faculty of education at the university of hong kong in which an elicit problem - based learning ( pbl ) approach was used to investigate the challenges associated with the adoption and use of information and communication technologies ( ict ) in hong kong secondary school classrooms ."
"when investigating real - life problems , students work co - operatively in a small group , usually with the assistance of a tutor and with access to other resources to : ( a ) clarify the problem ; ( b ) identify learning needs to address the problem ; ( c ) undertake individual reading / study ; and , ( d ) apply newly acquired insights and understandings to re - address the problem .","while different models have been used , the basic premise is that pbl is a way of constructing and teaching courses using problems as the stimulus and focus for student activity ( boud & feletti , , p . ) ."
"by framing courses around real problems in the context of real practice , pbl has presented a coherent and practical approach to learning which incorporates active rather than passive approaches to the development of critical thinking skills , eeriential and social learning in the form of collaborative inquiry based on engaging with authentic problems , and more dynamic interactions between teachers and learners based on respect for students prior learning and eerience ( hendry , frommer , & walker , ; mcphee , ) .","and , in conceptualising problems in terms of real practice , pbl has also incorporated notions of reflective practice and life long learning into a coherent view of professional education and training for both novice and eerienced practitioners ."
"in the studies identified , the adoption of pbl in specific modules ( subjects ) in educational psychology , science education and social studies education in initial ( pre - service ) primary and secondary teacher education programmes ( courses ) has been considered to be successful ( casey & howson , ; gibson , ; mcphee , ; murray - harvey & slee , ; steinkuehler , derry , hmelo - silver , & delmarcelle ; pearson , kwan , & wong , ; peterson , peterson & treagust , ) , although caveats about the difficulties of writing educational problems , the need for tutors in teacher education programmes to model interactive approaches , and issues to do with assessment in collaborative learning settings have been noted .","while pbl has been widely adopted , there are relatively few published case studies of pbl in teacher education and , specifically about the use of pbl to investigate the challenges associated with the integration of new technology in schools ."
"at the university of southern queensland , an interactive multimedia package based on pbl principles was developed to assist pre - service teachers investigate problems related to the integration of technology into teaching ( albion & gibson , ; gibson & albion , ) .",pbl has also been used in modules in teacher education programmes which focus on ict in schools .
"the design and implementation of the module is briefly described , and data about students in the module are presented .",this article is a contribution to the limited case study literature about the use of pbl in the professional education of teachers in the context of a graduate studies module about the integration of ict in teaching / learning activities in hong kong schools .
"it was also thought that new technology could play a catalyst role in the transformation of school education , helping to turn schools into dynamic and innovative learning institutions where students can become motivated , inquisitive and creative learners ( education & manpower bureau , , p . ) .",the five year strategy also presented a vision for ite which involved a paradigm shift in schools - teaching / learning activities were eected to change from a largely textbook - based teacher - centred approach to a more interactive and learner - centred approach .
"a curriculum development council report , which advocated school - based curriculum development based around eight key learning areas , also promoted changes in the culture of teaching and learning by infusing generic skills such as information technology in teaching and learning activities ( curriculum development council , , p . ) .",- 62 ) recommended a new culture of learning and teaching in schools including inter alia shifting from the transmission of knowledge to learning how to learn ; from compartmentalised subjects to integrated learning ; from textbooks to diversified learning to teaching materials ; and from traditional time - tabling to an integrated and flexible arrangement of learning time .
"there are many reasons , including the difficulties imposed by building designs ( multi - story buildings and small classrooms ) , the general conditions of teachers ( large classes , heavy teaching loads ) , and the eectations held by teachers , students and parents about the need to cover the content if students are to be prepared for examinations designed to assess knowledge of content ( dimmock , ) .","however , there has not been widespread adoption of the proposals presented in the five year strategy ( cite , ; coniam , ) ."
presenting the mature age teachers enrolled in this med module with an opportunity to discuss ict in a structured way also raised the possibility that new knowledge / insights about using ict in schools might be generated which was considered to be less likely to occur when only a tutor s perspective was under consideration and evaluation .,"given these challenges , it was considered that the adoption of an elicit pbl pedagogy would be an appropriate way in which students could critically examine recent policy initiatives in ict ( and curriculum reforms outlined in other policy documents ) and , at the same time grapple with the difficulties which often arise when attempts are made to translate new initiatives into practice in the school setting ."
"many models of pbl appear in the literature ( barrows & tamblyn , ; boud & feletti , ; charlin , mann & hansen , ; hendry et al . , ; margetson , ) .","however , the following definition encapsulated two key ideas that influenced the curriculum design of the module ."
"( attributed to barrows & kelson in ayres , , p . ) the design and implementation of the model was an adaptation of other models - presented by the faculty of medicine at the university of lindberg ( nd ) and ayres - that had been used successfully in another programme with a group of mature age students in the preceding semester .",the process replicates the commonly used systemic approaches to resolving problems or meeting challenges that are encountered in life and career .
"based on these ideas about pbl as curriculum and process , a number of objectives relating to the content of the module were developed .",these focused on the : ( a ) aims and rationale ( s ) for using ict in secondary schools ; ( b ) the use of ict to enhance learning activities in business classes ; and ( c ) practical issues to do with access to and management of ict resources .
the case study presented a scenario in which the head of the business panel encouraged teachers to do more to support student learning activities with ict by investigating and discussing three topics ( problems ) based on the objectives developed for the module .,"this case study described the ict resources and personal skills of teachers , the ways in which ict was currently used , and the impediments that might impact on the wider adoption of ict in classroom learning activities in a typical government secondary school in hong kong ."
most ( n = ) had - 10 years teaching eerience ( range - 20 years ) .,the students ( n = ) undertaking the programme were teachers in secondary schools ( n = ) or with the vocational training council .
"for each topic , students were asked to nominate a leader ( to ensure investigations kept on task and on time ) , a recorder ( to summarise and record discussions ) and presenters ( to prepare face - to - face and online presentations ) .","at the beginning of the module , students self - selected into three groups ."
students were eected to investigate the content of the module by examining the case study ( as three topics ) in on - campus classes and online discussion forums .,"for each problem , students were referred to the case study , given printed copies of required readings , and suggestions for further reading about the topic ."
"since an elicit pbl strategy had been adopted in the design of the module , it was decided to evaluate the extent to which the adoption of pbl as curriculum and process had been implemented successfully .",four evaluative questions ( eqs ) were initially framed to guide this evaluation .
"the question was initially posed to focus on the adoption of pbl in face - to - face classes , and then extended to online discussions following the decision to investigate topic totally online following the suspension of classes due to sars .","the question was examined to determine the extent to which an elicit pbl strategy had actually been followed in face - to - face classes , and whether the same strategy was transferable to an online learning environment ."
eq2 : did an academic discourse develop when topics ( problems ) were investigated ?,this question was designed to focus attention on the nature of the discussions in face - to - face and online activities .
"was new knowledgesuch as the clarification of current policies and practices , and the development of well - supported practical solutions to perceived problems - an outcome of students discussions about each topic ( problem ) ?","it was considered to be important to address this question to ensure that content acquired was significant and relevant , and that the processes by which that knowledge had been acquired was not the only thing which was considered important in the adoption of a pbl strategy ."
"tutors must adopt a position on the margin of the group ( s ) as problems are investigated , yet intervene decisively as needed when problems have not been appropriately addressed and procedures need to be clarified .",the extent to which the tutor could accomplish these roles when the face - to - face discussions in three groups could not be constantly monitored added to the importance of investigating this question .
"hence , it was decided that student s preferences for a mode of learning that differed from previous practice in this , and other modules in the programme , should be investigated more fully .",the decision ( by the tutor ) to use online discussions to investigate topic meant that one - third of the module would involve working totally online .
a variety of data were collected to evaluate the use of pbl on this med module ( see table ) .,"while the intention had been to video record discussions of one group per topic , technical problems with the video recording , and the suspension of classes due to sars meant that discussions ( two sessions in topic ) for only one group ( n = ) were available for analysis ."
the analysis of face - to - face and online discussions was based on a close reading of the transcripts in terms of the evaluative questions ( eq1 - eq4 ) that had been framed to guide the evaluation .,this enabled campus - based and online discussions and events to be interpreted in light of the ideas about curriculum and process that had been influential in the design of the module .
this is evident in comments at various times during the discussion :,"an analysis ( table ) of the transcripts of face - to - face discussions for one group ( topic , weeks and ) revealed that this group followed closely the suggested model ( tables and ) introduced at the beginning of the module ."
"the steps provided the leader and other members of the group with specific guidance about how the investigation of a topic should proceed , and how discussions could be brought back on track when comments were not relevant to the topic .","once they had moved to another step , they did not return to a previous step to reexamine issues discussed or decisions taken ."
"while the differences in participation did not appear to impact on the outcomes of the group on these occasions , their existence suggests that there is a need to outline the eectations of leaders rather than assume - as in this case - that leaders have sufficient knowledge and eerience to manage groups efficiently .",an analysis was also completed of the online discussion to examine the extent to which participants contributed messages and worked collaboratively to investigate topic .
this may have resulted because messages were always available and could be re - examined at any stage throughout the discussion .,"variation is also evident ( as in face - toface discussions ) in the extent to which members contributed to the online discussion , with assigned roles ( student f as leader , and student e as recorder / presenter ) again appearing to be influential in participation ."
"tables and reveal that participants followed an elicit pbl strategy when investigating topics , following the steps in the model presented ( table ) and working collaboratively ( sharing ideas ) when topics were investigated .","hence , pbl provided a practical strategy by which topics in the module could be examined in both face - to - face and online discussions ."
"table contributions of students and tutor to the online discussion in the face - to - face discussions , these comments were typically short , made in the flow of conversation .","i think your ideas are very interesting , because we can see the differences in using ict with different groups of students ."
provides / seeks clarification i would like to answer your second question first .,"our school does not have any computers that can be borrowed by students for home use as we are not part of the digital bridge programme , but there are laptops that can be borrowed by students for use on campus ."
"in order to achieve this target , many teachers just use computers as an electronic blackboard ( as emily has mentioned ) .","in the it policy proposed by government , it sets a standard for teachers to achieve at least % of class time in using ict ."
the responses to two specific questions in the reflective statements students were asked to complete at the end of each problem also contributed interesting data on academic discourse .,"many students commented on the active participation of others , and the active sharing of ideas in group discussions ."
"my peers have actively participated in the group discussions , evaluating alternatives and choosing the best solutions .",it was better for each of us to contribute a little rather than one person prepare the whole response .
i logged into webct regularly and participated in group discussions trying to figure out suggestions to the questions .,"also , eva and i summed up all the points in the discussion and prepared the summary ."
i appreciate that they finished things very efficiently and contributed some useful ideas to the group .,they were actively involved in the discussions in class and on webct .
these data illustrate academic discourse in both face - to - face and online discussions .,"in online discussions , responses were more detailed reflecting , perhaps , more time to research and think about responses than in the face - to - face discussions ."
"hence , the strategy was instrumental in helping students acquire critical knowledge about the use of ict in the business curriculum .","each topic in the case study became a problem to investigate which , given the absence of any readily available solutions , could only be dealt with by considering original insights and solu - tions ."
"in the first face - to - face session , the tutor intervened on five occasions with comments on : ( a ) designing learning activities involving ict ; ( b ) clarifying the focus of the topic ; ( c ) the role of the teacher in learning activities ; ( d ) pbl strategy ; and ( e ) a minor clarification regarding procedure .","hence , the time available to contribute to discussions , especially in face - to - face classes , was limited ."
"importantly , they were also considered to be appropriate by students who supported - in reflective comments - the idea of the tutor as facilitator , someone who observed , listened and questioned , clarified concepts , clarified what we needed to do , and helped us to focus on important issues in the topic .","after reading and reflecting on the transcripts , these interventions were considered to be consistent with the role of the tutor outlined earlier in this article ."
"other studies have found that learners would prefer a learning environment more favourable than the one perceived as being present ( fraser , ( fraser , , but in this case , the stu - dents actual and perceived environments were closely related showing student s satisfaction with the learning environment eerienced .","using manova for repeated measures , it was found that differences between actual and preferred scores on the nine oles scales were not statistically significant ( p < 1 ) ."
these outcomes indicate that pbl can be a viable strategy to investigate the challenges associated with the use of ict in schools in both face - to - face and online learning situations in teacher education programmes .,"in relation to the definition of pbl as curriculum and process which influenced the design and implementation of this module , and the questions ( eqs ) which shaped the evaluation of the work of one group of students , this module can be regarded as successful : an elicit pbl strategy was followed when topics were investigated ; an academic discourse developed as these topics were analysed , researched and discussed ; new knowledge was evident in relation to issues , concerns and solutions about perceived problems ; the role adopted by the tutor facilitated group participation and outcomes ; and the online learning context was consistent with features of stu - dents preferred learning environment ."
"rather than casting a student professional into the role of the omniscient solver in these cases , they might serve a better purpose as stories of how a particular person or group of people defined a situation and responded to it .","but when descriptive situations are presented to students , they require a great deal of narrative and contextual detail , providing as many perspectives as possible ."
the challenge in introducing new technology in schools is to take account of all perspectives on the adoption and use of ict .,this needs to be recognised when pbl is adopted and problems are written .
"however , the constitution also stipulates that the prc was founded by the chinese communist party ( ccp ) which is the leader of the chinese people .","according to the constitution of the people ' s republic of china ( prc ) , all the power in the country belongs to the people who exercise their power through the npc and local people ' s congresses at all levels ; and the people manage the state , economy , culture , and other social affairs through a multitude of means and forms ."
"the standing committee of the npc , which is further composed of a series of special committees and working and administrative bodies ( see figure . 1 ) is empowered to modify legislation between plenary sessions of , and carry out the daily work of , the npc on a more permanent basis .","in addition to indirectly electing the state council , the npc can also dismiss the holders of the top offices of state ."
"some , 000 ccp delegates are elected to the national congress of the ccp , which is held every five years .","although there are other political organizations in china , the only organization that matters is the chinese communist party ( ccp ) ."
the overwhelming majority of delegates to the npc are party members .,at the bottom of this pyramid are ' primary party organizations ' in workplaces and villages .
"the term ' baiping ' is composed of two chinese characters - ' bai ' ( to place , to put , to arrange , etc . )","since the late s , a new chinese terminology - baipinghas been popularized in mainland china ."
"moreover , a large number of non - communist party and non - party individuals were selected as state leaders with the titles of vice chairpersons of the npc and of the chinese people ' s political consultative congress ( cppcc ) in exchange for their support of the ccp as the permanent ruler of the state .","for example , during the - 08 and the - 13 tenures , china ' s state - level leaders included nine standing members of the ccpcc politburo ( some of whom also held the posts of president , premier , the npc and cppcc chairmen ) and dozens of vice chairpersons of the npc and of the cppcc ."

these are the village committees ( cunweihui ) in rural areas and the resident committees ( juweihui ) in urban areas .,"in addition , there are also systems of governance that operate beneath the various levels of state administration described above ."
these innovations were part of wider efforts to restore some form of governance at village level .,"urban residents ' committees usually cover anywhere between and over , 000 households ."
"amendments were made to the constitution at the st session of the th npc on april , , the st session of the th npc on march , , and the nd session of the th npc on march , , respectively .",it is clear that the leadership of the cpc is stressed in the constitution .
"china ' s legislation is also created at more local levels by the people ' s congresses of provinces , autonomous regions , municipalities , prefectures , and cities .","the constitution notes : the party branch office tablet is written in red and located on the right side , denoting that the ccp is always in a superior position in china ."

article refers to the people ' s procuratorates as ' state organs for legal supervision ' .,"the judicial system of the prc is established in articles - 135 , and consists of the people ' s courts , the supreme people ' s court , the people ' s procuratorates , the supreme people ' s procuratorate , military procuratorates and other special people ' s procuratorates ."
"the duties of each of these courts are as follows : at present , the basic people ' s courts are comprised of thousands of courts at county level .",there are hundreds of intermediate people ' s courts at prefectural or municipal level and higher people ' s courts located in the provinces .
"in civil cases the procuratorate does not possess a right to file a direct protest , but it can initiate adjudication supervision via a protest .","protests are filed by the procuratorate in criminal cases , when it is believed that an error has occurred in the law , or facts , as determined by the judgment or order of the court of first instance ."
"for example , there is one lawyer per , 000 people in china ( the ratio is one lawyer per people in the united states ) .","and finally , in many western democracies , the ultimate arbiter of a law ' s constitutionality is the court system ."
"with the current system skewed toward resolving businessbusiness and state - business disputes , the individual plaintiff is often at a significant disadvantage .","since , prompted by the need to provide a safe environment for foreign capital , the ccp has increasingly codified business laws and sought to train its lawyers and judges to deal effectively and efficiently with the growing civil and commercial caseload ."
"the petition system auspiciously provides an avenue by which individuals can lodge complaints about treatment they have received from the government , other individuals , or private companies .","remember , in china the hand of the state is involved everywhere , visibly and invisibly , even when disputes seem to involve private companies ."

"abuses exist within these systems , but the underpinnings favor the individual defendant against the state until guilt is proven .","when a suspect does go to trial , it is the duty of the prosecution to prove his / her guilt beyond reasonable doubt ."
"however , many of the abuses occur at the hands of local and provincial officials among whom corruption is rampant and over whom the central ccp is able to exercise little control .",the ccp aims to build the legal infrastructure of the country and has embarked on this in its technocratic manner of studying the laws of other countries and carefully codifying its ' chinese characteristics ' .
"as in other areas , reform in the legal system has often served only a safety valve function - more cases processed , more complaints heard , yet the outcomes remain largely unchanged .","whether these small steps forward ultimately add up to momentum remains to be seen , but many believe that an eanding legal system could bring about true democratic progress in the prc ."
"as of , china ' s per capita gdp was already twelve times greater than it was three decades ago .","since china undertook its reforms in , the chinese economy has grown at an average rate of nearly ten percent a year ."
"it is sometimes used in a narrower sense to refer to economic reforms that were prescribed just for developing nations , which included advice to reduce government deficits , to liberalize and deregulate international trade and cross border investment , and to pursue ert led growth ( williamson , ) .","the term ' washington consensus ' was initially coined in by john williamson to describe a set of ten specific economic policy prescriptions that he considered should constitute the ' standard ' reform package promoted for crisis - wracked developing countries by washington - based institutions such as the imf , the world bank , and the us treasury department ."
"this new approach to foreign aid , combined with admiration for china ' s economic success , is boosting its world influence , as well as access to energy and other natural resources .","meanwhile , china ' s autocratic leadership , which shows no sign of liberalizing , has set the foundation for future economic successes ; by contrast , us economic progress seems hindered by its democratic processes ( halper , ( song , ) ."

"in many western nations , presidents and governors are elected ; but in china only those who have rich and successful working eeriences at the lower or local levels can be selected to be higher - ranked officials .","therefore , the author argues that china ' s selection of cadres from the lower to a higher level and conscious personnel training is superior to the west ' s election system ."
"under the western multiparty system , each party represents different interest groups .","but in china , since the reform and opening up , economic policies have been made by the ccp without special bias in favor of any interest groups ."
"in fact , over the last years , the chinese economy has moved unmistakably toward the market doctrines of neoclassical economics , with an emphasis on prudent fiscal policy , economic openness , privatization , market liberalization , and the protection of private property ( yao , ) .","since the beginning of its open - door policies , china has benefited increasingly from global interdependence and the modern world ' s free flow of goods , capital , and people ."
"however , this also resulted in declining health care ( hospitals , like schools , also became money - making centers for local bureaucrats ) , illegal eropriation of farmers ' land , and more corruption , all of which have led to increasing social disorder among peasants who are finding themselves worse off ( huang , ) .","and there was a proliferation of high - rise buildings and massive construction projects ( the three gorges dam , the olympics complex , the high - speed rail system , and so on ) ."
"besides hong kong , which was among the worst hit , gdp growth rates in taiwan , singapore , and thailand were also lower in .","in addition to the human toll , it was inflicting significant economic damage across asia ."
"as the chinese people demand more than economic gains as their income increases , it will become increasingly difficult for the ccp to contain or discourage social discontent .","in addition , china also has the highest urban - rural income gap in the world ."
"other developing countries have suffered from the so - called middle - income trap - a situation that often arises when a country ' s per capita gdp reaches the range of $3,000 to $8,000 , the economy stops growing , income inequality increases , and social conflicts erupt .","china has now entered this stage , and it still remains unclear how this will affect the chinese economy and society in the long term ."
"while china ' s current political system has been driving its economic growth strongly ( to be discussed in chapter ) , it has also led to the development of a series of socioeconomic problems .","however , the large surge in income inequalities was not the only unwanted result of the chinese - style reform ."
this is the so - called socialism with chinese characteristics and the one that distinguishes china from western democracies in which the court system is a critical component of the checks and balances placed on the other branches of government .,"in fact , china ' s lack of an independent judicial system exacerbates all the other fault lines running through the authoritarian state ; there simply is no effective recourse available to individuals whose interests are harmed by the excesses of ccp officials , laws , and institutions ."

the results will also enable them to review and adjust policies in order to better accommodate changes according to the trends of society .,"the resulting measurement gives very important information for decision - makers , in the government and in the private sector , to examine the magnitude of changes that have taken place in a given period of time ."
"this paper provides a method - the t - model , to investigate and measure the extent of change of sustainable culture through two extensive surveys among participants of the construction industry of hong kong .","the change in sustainable culture is reflected by the change in attitude and practice among construction participants , this can be found in their performance in project development , design and construction operations ."
item of the principles calls for ' ' change of attitudes and practices ' ' .,change of attitudes and practices meant a transformation of mind - set and actions .
"in , the chief executive of the government of hong kong special administrative region ( hksar ) introduced the sustainable development concept to hong kong .",his policy address outlined a plan for implementing sustainable development .
"stakeholders of the construction industry might have performed voluntarily and involuntarily in the implementation of sustainable rules and regulations , however , through the years of practice may have changed their mind - set subconsciously towards sustainability .","such change is considered as a change in sustainable culture which is considered as one of the fundamental drivers for sustainability ( rethinking construction , ) ."
"according to a report by the environmental protection department ( epd , ) , construction waste amounted to , 884 tonnes per day in , % ( 4,125 tonnes per day ) of the total construction waste were disposed of at landfill sites in hong kong .","it is obvious that the construction industry fundamentally encompasses on issues related to economic , social and environmental attributes which are important to the sustainable development of hong kong ."
"sustainable culture is not static , but changes with time according to social demands for sustainability and global tendency in sustainable development .",the answers to these questions are directly related to the developments in sustainable culture among stakeholders via implementation of these rules and regulations .
sustainable culture is the driving force for sustainability among stakeholders in the construction industry .,"it constitutes attitudinal and behavioural components and is categorized into awareness , concern , motivation and implementation ( blank , ; poon and yip , ) ."
"when construction industry stakeholders are aware of the negative impacts , e . g .",it is an inner vision in a state of mind to provoke change to rectify the unsatisfied condition .
"the attitude of concern would be constructed from cognitions , affective responses and behaviour .",concern of sustainability is an emotion of care developed on the judgments according to negative impacts and consequences .
the eagerness to change is the intention that tries to modify the status quo of the construction industry .,the promotion of sustainability in the circ report is a good example that showed motivation with a defined direction for improvement .
"it is the willingness of construction industry participants to spend time , energy , effort and money to initiate changes in order to achieve sustainable construction .","unlike the attitudinal attributes of awareness and concern , implementation is dynamic rather than static in the construction industry ."
measuring individually the movement of these attitudinal and behavioral components over a period of time will provide a picture on the change in essence and not available magnitude within the measured time frame .,"the former is represented by the change of cognitive attitudes in awareness and concern , whereas the latter is exhibited through behavioral actions in motivation and implementation ."
"most importantly , the measurement provides reliable references for decision - makers both in government and private sectors to understand the effectiveness of the current rules and regulations , so that areas of deficiency and mismatch can be identified , improvement considerations and follow up actions can be carried out accordingly .",it would be very interesting and indeed necessary to assess how the enforcement of rules and regulations designed for sustainability in hong kong has changed the culture of construction industry practitioners .
these can be categorized into five groups according to their functional roles and professional disciplines :,stakeholders of the construction industry of hong kong perform professional and supervisory works are responsible for various duties at different levels .
certain stakeholder groups create more sustainable output ; while others yield less sustainable results .,stakeholders from different disciplines perform different roles and discharge different functions and duties .
"the hierarchical order of influence is generally established , however , the magnitude of influence of each stakeholder group that affects the sustainable effect of the built assets , however , is to be elored in this study by means of questionnaire surveys and the t - model .","the developers , who invest on development projects and employ consultants and contractors to design and construct according to development schemes , influence the outputs and performances of the consultants and contractors as well as the npps ."
formulae and of the t - model which are demonstrated below eress how the data are handled .,"similar approaches are applied to other cultural components to obtain the total concern , total motivation and total implementation of construction participants ."
"therefore , the score of cultural component of a specific stakeholder group in any year is","to evaluate the cultural shift of each stakeholder group , the influential factor ( a i ) of each group must be taken into account ."
"since cultural shift is a continuous process , measurements should be conducted regularly .",consecutive investigations that take place at suitable intervals would uniformly provide a series of cultural values reflecting the tendency of the cultural shift .
theories of human behaviour and behavioural changes developed by allport and ajzen were used as the basis .,the design of the questionnaire was based on recent research studies on changes in attitudes and behaviours for sustainability within the construction industry .
one of the questions seeks the views of the respondents on the influential power of each stakeholder group and how this power may affect the sustainability of the construction industry in hong kong .,these included key sustainable indicators established by the government and how these indicators affect the sustainability of hong kong .
part of the questionnaire addresses the respondent ' s ' ' concern ' ' about sustainability .,the new environmental paradigm ( nep ) developed by dunlap and van liere in their - nep scales that measure ' ' paradigmatic ' ' shift was adopted .
autonomous ' ' motivation ' ' for sustainability will start to take place when they perform their duties in their respective disciplines .,part of the questionnaire was designed on the ground that concern of sustainability is built up among the construction participants and the extent of acquiescence and mentality of acceptance of sustainability is sufficiently mature .
what were the physical works that the respondents have implemented might have helped to realize sustainable construction ?,part of the questionnaire investigates the magnitude of ' ' implementation ' ' of sustainability .
"to measure the cultural shift achieved in the researched years with respect to the base year , part of the questionnaire provided a selection scale for the respondents to review retrospectively their changes in attitudes and behaviours .",the respondents are requested to revisit their performances over the years in discharging their duties within the research period .
"the questionnaires were sent by emails , post and personal contacts to government departments responsible for construction project development , as well as private sector organizations such as developers , consultant firms , general and specialist contractors .",samples in these two separate surveys were randomly selected from construction participants in hong kong at both professional and supervisory levels .
"most of them had over years of practical working eerience in the construction industry in hong kong , and some of them had over years of eerience .","demographic information of these random respondents displayed in table showed that the majority of the respondents were affiliated to professional bodies of hong kong including the hong kong institution of architects ( hkia ) , the hong kong institution of engineers ( hkie ) , the hong kong institution of surveyors ( hkis ) and the hong kong institute of construction managers ( hkicm ) ."
"although alpha obtained from the awareness aspect might not be satisfactory ( a < ) , results of f - tests indicated that all the scales used for measuring the sustainability in construction are reliable at the % significance level ( sig .",table is a summary of the cronbach ' s alpha reliability test for the questionnaire surveys in the years and .
the values of a i for various stakeholder group obtained from both surveys are suitable for use as multipliers for the respective cultural scores .,the small variation in influential factor shown in table demonstrates that the respondents from each stakeholder group shared equal perception about their influential power .
"the cultural values of the government group and the contractor group positively increased in all the cultural components , the former is the policy making party which promotes sustainability and the latter is the execution party which is obliged to perform according to statutory requirements and regulations .","these negative shifts represent deteriorations within these groups , proper corrective actions that may transform attitudes and behaviours of the respective stakeholder groups could yield significant and persistent improvements to sustainability in the construction industry ."
"similar results are obtained from the government group in ' ' concern ' ' and ' ' implementation ' ' between years and , reflecting the fact that the government and the developer groups in hong kong were not aggressive in the early years of the promotion of sustainable development in construction .","in contrast , the consultant , the contractor and the npp groups exhibited significant cultural shift throughout the research period ."
"both of the surveys were conducted in hong kong with random samples in two separate timeframes , namely , years and .",new rules and regulations for sustainable construction were progressively enforced within this period and examples of achievements in sustainable construction are shown in tables - 3 in parallel with the cultural shift in fig .
"although there was no improvement in economic conditions , the change became significant between the years and .","in this period , economic growth in hong kong was retarded and high unemployment rate was recorded due to an economic recession ."
the influential power of various stakeholder groups is a crucial factor that may change the sustainable outcome of the built assets .,the magnitude of influential factor ( a i ) of each group spelled out the differences in influential power of each stakeholder group that controlled the sustainable outcomes of the construction projects .
this study focused only on construction participants performing supervisory and managerial tasks at various levels .,construction workers who form a crucial part of construction participants were not included in the surveys .
the economy of hong kong started to pick up in and a steady growth in cultural shift is reflected in the investigation between the years and .,a sluggish cultural shift was eerienced in the economic recession period and a significant increase was recorded shortly after the sars outbreak in which uplifted the consensus of the public on improvement of hygienic condition and environmental protection .
the result of the measurement provided important information in finer details including the shift of cultural components within each stakeholder group .,the result of the study in two separate surveys provided important information for decision - makers of the construction industry in government and private sectors to review their policy .
the cases were distributed as sporadic cases and small clusters .,"in late june ( 3.5 months from the last recognized mers - cov case in our hospital ) , the emergency department ( ed ) evaluated the first case of the current outbreak , which was ongoing through early september ."
"the ed is a - bed multisection complex area that serves more than , 000 visits a year .","there are different intensive care units ( icus ) in the institution with a bed capacity of serving approximately , 000 admissions and , 000 patient - days of care every year ."
the population screened in the current study was suspected patients either admitted or evaluated at the ed as well as eed hcws .,the case definition used was based on the definition update released by the saudi ministry of health in june .
nasopharyngeal swab samples were obtained from all eed hcws and nasopharyngeal swab samples or other appropriate types of specimens were obtained from all eed / suspected patients .,"once a case was classified as probable or confirmed , a list of all eed hcws and / or patients was generated ( by respective department and / or hcws ) and contact tracing was started ."
"with shutdown of the hospital services and engineering modifications , more locations ( icus and wards ) were dedicated for isolation and more rooms were converted to negative pressure rooms .","complete evacuation of the ed was achieved on august , ."
"because the screening and the behavior of the mers - cov infection was considerably different in patients and hcws , we compared demographic information , symptoms , medical history , and outcome measures between both groups .","the or fisher exact test , as appropriate , was used to test significant differences of categorical variables between the study groups ."
"whereas all hcw infections ( n = ) were classified as healthcare - acquired , one - third ( n = ) of patients had community - acquired infection and two - thirds ( n = ) had healthcare - acquired infection .",the majority ( 77% ) of patients were classified as confirmed cases whereas the majority ( 67% ) of hcws were classified as probable ( p < . 001 ) .
"a ) , the frequency of probable diagnosis ( and asymptomatic cases ) relatively increased towards the end of the outbreak ( fig .",as the frequency of hcws relatively increased towards the end of the outbreak ( fig .
"overall , respiratory symptoms ( 95% ) , especially shortness of breath ( 73% ) and / or cough ( 68% ) , were the most common symptoms reported , followed by fever ( 81% ) , other constitutional symptoms ( 61% ) , and gastrointestinal symptoms ( 39% ) .","for respiratory symptoms , patients reported more shortness of breath ( p < . 01 ) but less sore throat ( p = . 03 ) compared with hcws ."
"as shown in table , patients had clearly more comorbidity than hcws in terms of its presence ( 99% vs %, p < . 001 ) or the number of comorbid diseases ( 5.6 [ 2.3 ] vs [ 1.1 ] , p < . 001 ) .","the most common diseases among patients were hypertension ( 81% ) , diabetes ( 78% ) , heart disease ( 52% ) , chronic kidney disease ( 44% ) , immunosuppressive disease ( 41% ) , neurologic disease including stroke ( 28% ) , respiratory disease ( 25% ) , cancer ( 22% ) , and dyslipidemia ( 20% ) ."
this was closely similar to the conditions believed to have contributed to the rapid spread of mers - cov in several hospitals in saudi arabia and south korea .,", for example , combinations of several contributing factors , such as crowded ed environment , close and unprotected contacts with a symptomatic case , and possibly fomite transmission , have been suggested as causes in the korean outbreak ."
"one of the most striking finding of the current study , yet previously reported , is the high mortality among patients and lack of such mortality among hcws .",this elanation was supported by the lack of major differences in the frequency of fever and respiratory symptoms among symptomatic cases of both patients and hcws .
"in the united states , acute bronchitis and tracheitis is the ninth most common illness in outpatients as reported by physicians .",observed in the winter and fall than in the summer and spring .
"nevertheless , at least % of patients with acute bronchitis and tracheitis in the united states receive antibacterial antibiotics after visiting a physician .","thus , the true causes of the illness are unknown in most cases ."
infections of the epithelium of the bronchi and trachea are thought to incite an inflammatory response .,"pathologically , there is an accompanying microscopic thickening of bronchial and tracheal mucosa corresponding to the inflamed areas ."
"the viruses implicated in acute bronchitis and tracheitis include influenza a and b ( chapter ) , parainfluenza ( chapter ) , respiratory syncytial virus ( chapter ) , coronavirus ( chapter ) , adenovirus ( chapter ) , and rhinoviruses ( chapter ) , usually in this order from the most to the least common .","furthermore , pathologic islands of inflammation have been found in the trachea with rhinovirus infection , thus supporting the idea of a patchy distribution ."
"among patients with primarily small airways disease , some might be eected to have prominently decreased breath sounds in the areas involved .","the definition of acute bronchitis and tracheitis also seeks to differentiate the illness from acute inflammation of the small airways ( bronchiolitis ) , even though the accompanying symptoms with the former may include sputum production , wheezing , and shortness of breath ."
"occurring at a rate of per adults per year , acute bronchitis and tracheitis affects approximately % of adults annually .","a higher incidence is season of the year , and the population ' s influenza vaccination status ."
"in children , bronchiolitis has been associated with respiratory syncytial virus , influenza virus , parainfluenza virus , and metapneumovirus ( chapter ) .","thus , there are probably wide variations in the anatomic distribution of all pathogens causing acute bronchitis and tracheitis , extending from the nasal mucosa to the bronchiolar epithelium ."
"associated symptoms vary and include sputum production , fever , malaise , wheezing , and dyspnea .","with acute bronchitis , there is often a continued cough and sometimes a worsened cough that lasts an initial to weeks ."
acutely ill patients may not be able to distinguish their early symptoms from those accompanying very mild upper respiratory infections .,"however , with acute bronchitis and tracheitis , a protracted phase of coughing persists beyond to days , during which time pulmonary function tests may become abnormal ."
"however , their value lies in identifying a virus for which there is therapy or avoiding antibacterial antibiotics if any virus is identified .",rapid diagnostic tests exist for most viruses linked to acute bronchitis and tracheitis .
"in some studies , to % of patients with coughing that persists for longer than week had pertussis .","when "" atypical "" bacteria are identified by culture or serology , patients tend to be seen later in the course of their illness than patients with viral causes and more often have wheezing ."
"however , if the clinician suspects an outbreak in the community or the likelihood of pertussis , rapid testing with pcr may be quite beneficial .","in general , testing for atypical organisms should not be done because of the cost of pcr and both the insensitivity and slowness of cultures ."
limited data on short - and long - term outcomes show that up to % of patients have persistent or recurrent symptoms for a month .,"coughing usually lasts to days , during which time the illness causes significant transient decrements in vitality and social functioning ."
a large clinical trial in a population with a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infection found that amoxicillin for days was no better than placebo .,"these results are not surprising because , at most , about % of cases are probably caused by bacterial pathogens ."
"however , many patients cannot tolerate erythromycin , and either doxycycline , mg every hours , or a newer macrolide such as treatment azithromycin , mg on day and mg / day thereafter , is effective .","the latter two drugs are also active against c . pneumoniae and m . pneumoniae , although the optimal duration of therapy for acute bronchitis is unknown ."
the first - generation drugs amantadine and rimantadine are ineffective against h3n2 influenza a viruses and are not recommended .,"during influenza season , anti - influenza agents may be useful in decreasing symptoms by approximately day and may lead to a - day earlier return to normal activity in patients with influenza ."
"however , the widespread use of either type of drug alone or as a combination in naturally occurring , community - acquired bronchitis and tracheitis has not been evaluated .","in eerimental rhinovirus colds , nonsteroidal drugs , alone or in combination with antihistamines , reduce the severity of symptoms , including cough ."
"the importance of agriculture and the threat of emerging diseases have given rise to the emergence of biosecurity systems and containment strategies that serve to protect crops , livestock , and human populations from the threat of foreign disease agents .",sophisticated biodefense programs have grown beyond protecting deployed military forces and have become part of homeland defense .
"indeed , the technological advances in biowarfare from the cold war era have already been used against us ( miller et al . , ) .","when looking back on the topic of biosecurity , we appreciate that many of the concerns we had came from the possibility that harmful biological agents had fallen into the wrong hands ."
"the pathogen emerged in and , in a - year period , was responsible for the culling of nearly million birds and more than associated human deaths .","the disease emerged in hong kong but , in the course of years , spread across asia and into africa and europe ."
an outbreak of a biologically engineered pathogen might have greater disease potential than recently discovered naturally emerging diseases .,"as such , science that can be used to save lives may also be used to take lives ( ainscough , ) ."
"there are those who say : "" the first world war was chemical ; the second world war was nuclear ; and that the third world war - god forbid - will be biological . ""","the th century was dominated by physics , but recent breakthroughs indicate that the next years likely will be "" the biological century . """
"in fact , technology over the past years enabled scientists to engineer pathogens to be qualitatively different from conventional bioweapon agents .","the prospects for future bioweaponry advanced by technology are sobering ( block , ) ."
"as discussed in chapter seeds of destruction , while the united states and her allies were dismantling their bioweapons programs in the s , the soviets , under biopreparat , were assembling a huge bioweapons production capacity , comprising dozens of production facilities and as many as , 000 personnel .",this massive program aimed to build offensive capabilities by mass producing many of the category a and b agents .
"it is important to note that , in the soviet ' s view , the best biological agents were those for which there was no prevention and no cure .","for those agents for which vaccines or treatment existedsuch as plague , which can be treated with antibiotics - antibiotic - resistant or immunosuppressive variants were to be developed ."
"he briefly described the goal of project bonfire , which dealt with the creation and potential eloitation of antibiotic - resistant strains of bacteria .","by his own admonition , the goal of his research program was to create a more deadly biological weapon ."
the concept sounds reminiscent of the legend of the trojan horse .,popov elained the idea was to create a bacterial agent that harbored a virus .
some genetically engineered agents may have already been produced and stockpiled by bioweapons eerts in the former soviet union .,biotechnology today is capable of most of the possibilities about which the jason group warned us .
how long would it take public health officials to develop a new diagnostic test and write a case definition ?,what if a highly lethal pathogen with a short incubation period had never even been encountered before ?
"this has been enhanced by some recent developments in what has become known as "" synthetic biology . """,synthetic biology means different things to different people and groups of technical professionals .
"it seems that the "" genie is already out of the bottle . """,what can be done to mitigate the threat of unregulated laboratories conducting research using synthetic biology procedures and services ?
"regardless of what whether or not you believe that synthetic biology will be used by persons of groups with ill intent , we can be certain that synthetic biology has great potential .","in fact , between and the us government invested more than $800 million dollars in synthetic biology research ( hhs , ) ."
the office of the secretary of defense identified countries that maintain various levels of offensive biological warfare capabilities or research facilities .,"china , iran , israel , libya , north korea , syria , and taiwan are believed to have produced operational quantities of biological weapons ( u . s . congress , office of technology assessment , ) ."
"the technology required to mass produce biological agents ( eg , yeast , bacteria , and viruses ) is relatively ineensive .","beer , cosmetics , pharmaceuticals , and vaccine production facilities alike use much of the same equipment , making it relatively easy to acquire ."
it is possible that that this may change with the capabilities of biological engineering and a new generation of weapons .,"stabilizing biological agents and deploying them , either overtly with sophisticated weaponry or covertly without endangering the perpetrator or friendly forces , requires eertise not widely held ( ainscough , ) ."
what has changed since to make these three scenarios more or less likely ?,"on the basis of what you know now and the current world situation , are these three possibilities still valid ?"
"if the intent of terrorists is to inflict mass casualties , then biological agents are likely to be used ( ainscough , ) .","they think big , seeking to go beyond "" conventional "" terrorism , and unlike most terrorists , they could be willing to use weapons of mass destruction ."
"these reasons , which he characterizes as myths and false assumptions , are as follows :","bioweapons counterproliferation eert dr . jim davis stated there are at least six reasons why senior officials and skeptics believe a significant bioweapons attack will not occur ( davis , ) ."
"a long incubation period may work to someone ' s advantage , especially if the act is covert and the perpetrator is looking to disseminate the agent along a broad front or from numerous points of release to make containment more difficult .",counter : do not make the mistake of questioning the motives or means of a terrorist .
hospitals will bear the brunt of caring for the sick and dying should a biological weapon be used .,"however , few hospitals are prepared to cope with even a handful of cases of a highly contagious , life - threatening disease , and few hospitals are prepared to manage even a modest surge in the numbers of seriously ill patients ."
"that agenda was successfully outlined in by dr . anthony fauci , director of the national institutes of health ( fauci , ) .","commensurate with this , the infectious diseases community might elect to encourage and reward basic science research efforts that seek to produce novel diagnostic technologies and preventive or therapeutic interventions for the diseases caused by biological weapons ."
"however , responding to enhanced , emerging , and advanced agents demands new paradigms , which allow for more rapid and cost - effective development of countermeasures .","the national institutes of health , in collaboration with other agencies , established a solid framework of research and product development resources for biodefense ."
the chip allows the processing unit to test for dozens of possibilities simultaneously based on dna - or rna - hybridization modalities .,"consider the lab - on - a - chip concept , in which a clinical specimen is placed on a microchip - like device , which has a complex microarray of dna - or ribonucleic acid ( rna ) - based diagnostics ."
a universal influenza vaccine is an example of a cross - protective vaccine .,"multiplecomponent vaccines include , within a single vaccine , elements that protect against viruses or microbes that are different but usually closely related ."
this approach would allow a small number of drugs to replace dozens of pathogen - specific drugs .,"a limited number of antiinfectives with broad - spectrum activity directed at common , invariable , and essential components of different classes of microbes could be effective against traditional and nontraditional threats ."
"broad - spectrum technology refers to capabilities , such as temperature stabilization or delivery method , that can be engineered into a wide array of existing and candidate products .",developing countermeasures that will be useful in responding to future threats represents a major challenge given the capabilities that these products must possess .
"other examples of platform technologies include screening systems , in vitro safety testing , eression modules , manufacturing technologies , and chemical synthesis designs .","for example , a proven monoclonal antibody fermentation and purification method can be applied to rapidly develop any therapeutic monoclonal antibody , avoiding lengthy development work ."
moral pressure costs nothing and can help ; silence is unacceptable now .,"the time has come for top biologists to assert their leadership and speak out , to take responsibility on behalf of their profession for the existence of these weapons and the means of protecting the population against them , just as leading physicists did a generation ago when nuclear weapons came along ."

"in this chapter , a microbiological classification of the organisms affecting the kidney is adopted .","although individual infectious processes may have a predilection to involve the renal vasculature , glomeruli , interstitium , or collecting systems , a purely anatomic approach to the classification of infectious diseases affecting the kidney is rarely helpful because most infections may involve several different aspects of renal function ."
elucidation of the cause of renal involvement in a child with evidence of infection must be based on a careful consideration of the geographic distribution of infectious diseases in different countries .,"a history of foreign travel ; eure to animals , insects , or unusual foods or drinks ; outdoor activities such as swimming or hiking ; and contact with infectious diseases must be sought in every case ."
"this difference might be elained by a complex interaction of several different factors , including nutrition , racial and genetically determined differences in immune responses , and eure to infectious diseases .","in several tropical countries , glomerulonephritis ( gn ) accounts for up to % of pediatric hospital admissions ; the incidence in temperate climates is - to - fold less ."
the organisms causing aki as part of systemic sepsis vary with age and geographic location and also differ in normal and immunocompromised children .,"depending on the severity of the infection and the organism responsible , the renal involvement may vary from insignificant proteinuria to aki requiring dialysis ."
leukocyte - endothelial interactions result in physical congestion of the medullary vasculature and further decrease regional blood flow .,"other mechanisms of renal damage in systemic sepsis include direct effects of endotoxin and other toxins on the kidney and release of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) and other cytokines , arachidonic acid metabolites , and proteolytic enzymes ."
"once established , renal failure supervenes , and the urine is of poor quality with low urine / plasma urea and creatinine ratios , elevated urine sodium concentration , and low urine osmolarity .","the renal findings early in septic shock are oliguria , with high urine / plasma urea and creatinine ratios , low urine sodium concentration , and a high urine / plasma osmolarity ratio ."
"occasionally , renal cortical necrosis or infarction of the kidney may result in prolonged or permanent loss of renal function .","in most children who develop aki as part of systemic sepsis or septic shock , the renal failure is of short duration , and recovery can be eected within a few days of achieving cardiovascular stability and eradication of the underlying infection ."
"in , a meningococcal b vaccine was approved for use in europe , canada , and australia , and it has been used in the united states to help control outbreaks ( see www .","in developed countries , most cases are caused by group b and y strains , particularly after introduction of meningococcal c vaccination , whereas epidemics of meningococcal groups a , c , and w135 continue to occur in many underdeveloped regions of the world ."
meningococcemia with purpuric rash and shock is the second and more devastating form of the illness .,"affected patients present with nonspecific symptoms of fever , vomiting , abdominal pain , and muscle ache ."
"children with fulminant sepsis , particularly with gram - negative organisms including n . meningitidis , can develop renal failure in association with rhabdomyolysis .","with advances in intensive care , however , more children are surviving the initial period of profound hemodynamic derangement , and renal failure is more often seen as a major management problem ."
"intense vasoconstriction further impairs tissue and organ perfusion , and vasculitis with intravascular thrombosis and consumption of platelets and coagulation factors is also present .","a loss of plasma proteins from the intravascular space is probably the major cause of shock , but myocardial suppression secondary to il6 production is also important ."
"children with meningococcemia should be aggressively managed in a pediatric intensive care unit , with early administration of antibiotics ( penicillin or a thirdgeneration cephalosporin ) , volume replacement , hemodynamic monitoring , and the use of inotropic agents and vasodilators .","if oliguria persists despite measures to improve cardiac output , elective ventilation and dialysis should be instituted early ."
"response to antibiotic treatment is good , but some patients may have persistent symptoms for many days resulting from an immune - complex vasculitis .","the features may overlap those of henoch - schonlein purpura or subacute bacterial endocarditis ( sbe ) , and the diagnosis must be considered in patients presenting with fever , arthritis , and vasculitic rash , often accompanied by proteinuria or hematuria ."
"during the s , thousands of cases were reported in the united states .",most cases were in menstruating women in association with tampon use .
"mucous membrane involvement with hyperemia and ulceration of the lips and oral mucosa or vaginal mucosa , strawberry tongue , and conjunctival injection are usually seen .","the illness usually begins suddenly with high fever , diarrhea , confusion , and hypotension , together with a diffuse erythroderma ."
"other disorders causing a similar picture , such as rocky mountain spotted fever , leptospirosis , measles , and streptococcal infection , must be excluded .","according to cdc criteria , the diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical features of fever , rash , hypotension , and subsequent desquamation along with deranged function of three or more of the following organ systems : the gastrointestinal ( gi ) , mucous membranes , renal , hepatic , hematologic , central nervous system , and muscle ."
"the staphylococcal enterotoxins induce disease by acting as superantigens , which activate t cells bearing specific v beta regions of the t - cell receptor ; this causes proliferation and cytokine release .",the systemic illness and toxicity are believed to result largely from an intense inflammatory response induced by the toxin .
"in addition to underperfusion , direct effects of the toxin or inflammatory mediators may also contribute to the renal damage .","recovery of renal function usually occurs , but in severe cases with cortical necrosis or intense renal vasculitis , prolonged dialysis may be required ."
"if oliguria persists despite optimization of intravascular volume and administration of inotropic agents , dialysis should be commenced early .","the management of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome depends on early diagnosis and aggressive cardiovascular support with volume replacement , inotropic support , and , in severe cases , elective ventilation ."
"if there is a focus of infection such as a vaginal tampon , surgical wound , or infected sinuses , the site should be drained early to prevent continued toxin release into the circulation .","the intravenous administration of immunoglobulins may be considered when infection is refractory to several hours of aggressive therapy , an undrainable focus is present , or persistent oliguria with pulmonary edema occurs ."
detection of gas in patients with apsgn may be possible by culture from the skin or the throat in some patients .,"other evidence of infection with a gas can be obtained through the antistreptolysin - o titer ( asot ) , which is increased in - 80 % of cases ."
"erythromycin , clindamycin , or a firstgeneration cephalosporin can be given to patients allergic to penicillin .",early antibiotic therapy can help to prevent the immune response against the streptococcal antigens and thus the progression to glomerulonephritis and other rheumatic fever sequelae .
"however , % of cases may have a prolonged and more serious course with long - term chronic renal failure .","most studies suggest that the prognosis for children with apsgn is good , with more than % making a complete recovery ."
"in addition , strains of group g streptococci have been implicated in occasional cases of apsgn .",isolates possessed the type m12 protein antigen identical to the nephritogenic type m12 antigen of some group a streptococcal strains .
il8 serves as a molecular bridge between receptors on neutrophils and the vascular endothelium .,cleavage of this protein prevents neutrophil attachment to the endothelium and results in uncontrolled spread of the bacteria through the tissues .
"surgical intervention to drain the infective focus in the muscle , bone , joint , or body cavities is often required .","antibiotic therapy with beta - lactams should be supplemented by treatment with a protein synthesis - inhibiting antibiotic , such as clindamycin , and it is suggested that this limits new toxin production ."
prospective observational studies have suggested that the concomitant use of immunoglobulin with clindamycin has a positive synergistic effect on mortality .,"the role of steroids remains unclear , with their hemodynamic benefit set against the detrimental effects of hyperglycemia secondary to gluconeogenesis ."
"the mortality from pneumococcal sepsis in asplenic patients is high , even with early antibiotic treatment and intensive support .","despite the prevalence of the organism , a significant renal involvement is relatively rare but is seen in two situations : pneumococcal septicemia in asplenic individuals or in those with other immunodeficiencies presents with fulminant septic shock in which renal failure may occur as part of a multisystem derangement ."
"neuraminidase causes desialation of red blood cells , and possibly other blood cells and endothelium , by the removal of terminal neuraminic acid , which leads to unmasking of the thomsen - friedenreich antigen ( t antigen ) which is present on the surface of red blood cells , platelets , and glomerular capillary endothelia .",s . pneumoniae ( as well as influenza and clostridia species ) produce the enzyme neuraminidase which cleaves sialic acid from the surfaces of eed cells .
"clues to a pneumococcal cause , in addition to culture results , include severe clinical disease , especially pneumonia , empyema , pleural effusion , or meningitis ; hemolytic anemia ; positive results on a direct coombs test ; and difficulties in abo crossmatching or a positive minor crossmatch incompatibility .",association of hus with s . pneumoniae is defined by culture of pneumococci from a normally sterile site within a week before or after onset of signs of hus .
"because normal serum contains antibodies against the thomsen - friedenreich antigen , blood transfusion should be undertaken with washed red blood cells resuspended in albumin rather than plasma .","exchange transfusion and plasmapheresis have been used in some patients , with the rationale that these procedures may improve outcome by eliminating circulating neuraminidase ."
"it is primarily a disease of wild and domestic animals , and humans are infected only occasionally through contact with animals .",most human cases occur in summer or autumn and are associated with eure to leptospira - contaminated water or soil during recreational activities such as swimming or camping .
renal functional abnormalities may be profound and out of proportion to the histologic changes in the kidney .,"renal involvement is predominantly a result of tubular damage , and spirochetes are commonly seen in the tubular lesions ."
"during this phase , the fever is low grade , and there may be headache and delirium caused by meningeal involvement , as well as intense muscular aching .","the fever then subsides , only to recur for the second , "" immune , "" phase of the illness ."
"cardiovascular ( 31 %) , pulmonary ( 26 %) , neurologic ( 5 %) , and hematologic ( 21 %) involvements were less common .","in one series , the most common organs involved were the liver ( 71 %) and kidney ( 63 %) ."
"supportive treatment with volume replacement to correct hypovolemia , administration of inotropes , and correction of coagulopathy is essential in severe cases .","the severity of leptospirosis is reduced by antibiotic treatment , even if started late in the course of the illness ."
renal involvement in the enteric infections may result from any of four possible mechanisms .,"although improvements in hygiene and living conditions have reduced the incidence of bacterial gastroenteritis in developed countries , these infections remain common in underdeveloped areas of the world , and outbreaks and epidemics continue to occur in both developed and underdeveloped countries ."
"immunofluorescent studies show igm , igg , and c3 deposition in the glomeruli , with salmonella antigens detected within the granular deposits in the mesangial areas .","renal biopsy findings show focal proliferation of mesangial cells , hypertrophy of endothelial cells , and congested capillary lumina ."
"yersinia antigens , immunoglobulin , and complement have been detected in the glomeruli .","yersinia pseudotuberculosis is well recognized as one of the causes of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis causing aki , especially in children ; patients have histories of drinking untreated water in endemic areas ."
the possibility of mycobacterial disease must be considered in patients with fever of unknown origin or unelained disease in the lungs or other organs .,"mycobacteria , both m . tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria , have also emerged as important causes of opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients undergoing dialysis and in patients undergoing renal transplantation ."
tubercle bacilli can be recovered from the urine in many cases of miliary tb .,"although most infected children successfully contain the infection and enter a state of latency , about % develop progressive primary or postprimary infection , with mycobacteria disseminating to many organs of the body during the lymphohematogenous phase of the disease ."
adult studies have shown that - 75 % of renal tb coexists with active pulmonary tb and - 10 % of screened sputum - positive pulmonary tb patients have renal involvement .,"the average latency period between pulmonary infection with bacillemia and clinical urogenital tuberculosis is years , and renal tb is more commonly seen in adults ."
"renal tb is treated with drug regimens similar to those used for other forms of tb , with isoniazid , rifampicin , pyrazinamide , and ethambutol administered initially for months and isoniazid and rifampicin then continued for a further - 10 months .","late scarring and urinary obstruction may occur in cases with extensive renal involvement , and such patients should be followed by ultrasonography or intravenous urogram ."
histologic findings are a diffuse proliferative gn or a membranous nephropathy .,"nephritis in congenital syphilis is usually associated with evidence of complement activation , with depressed levels of clq , c4 , c3 , and c5 ."
treatment of both congenital and acquired syphilis with antibiotics results in rapid improvement in the renal manifestations .,"antibodies reactive against treponemal antigens can be eluted from the glomerular deposits , and treponemal antigens are present in the immune deposits ."
a few cases of iga nephropathy have been reported following mycoplasma infection .,acute nephritis associated with mycoplasma infection may occur - 40 days after the respiratory tract infection .
"they are usually severely ill , with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates , fever , and leukocytosis .","shock may be present , and the renal impairment has been associated with acute rhabdomyolysis with high levels of creatine phosphokinase and myoglobinuria ."
the rickettsial diseases are caused by a family of microorganisms that have characteristics common to both bacteria and viruses and that cause acute febrile illnesses associated with widespread vasculitis .,"with the exception of q fever , all are associated with erythematous rashes ."
"rickettsial diseases have a worldwide distribution and vary widely in severity , from self - limited infections to fulminant and often fatal illnesses .","in view of the widespread vasculitis associated with these infections , subclinical renal involvement probably occurs in many of the rickettsial diseases ."
"the onset occurs - 8 days after the bite of an infected tick , and the majority of cases occur during the summer months .","high fever develops initially , followed by the pathognomonic rash , which occurs between the second and sixth days of the illness ."
"the renal lesions involve both blood vessels and interstitium , and acute tubular necrosis may occur .","acute gn with immune - complex deposition has been reported , but in most cases the pathology appears to be a direct consequence of the invading organism on the renal vasculature ."
"factors at presentation that have been associated with increased risk of developing renal impairment in adults are increasing age , rising bilirubin , thrombocytopenia , and neurological involvement .",aki was associated with increased mortality % in a recent mexican cohort .
"the incidence of renal complications in q fever is unknown due to the small numbers of case reports , but a recent case series of patients demonstrated that % had renal failure .","renal manifestations range from asymptomatic proteinuria and hematuria to aki , hypertension , and nephrotic syndrome ."
co - trimoxazole has been used as a safe alternative ( deemed safe in pregnant women ) as has clarithromycin .,"in the acute setting , treatment should continue until days after the fever has subsided ( usual duration is - 3 weeks ) ."
"nephritis is most commonly seen in association with intravascular infections such as sbe or infected ventriculoatrial shunts , but it is also seen after focal extravascular infections ; ear , nose , and throat infections ; and abscesses .","it is likely that any infectious agent that releases foreign antigens into the circulation , including those of very low virulence , can cause renal injury either by deposition of foreign antigens in the kidney or by the formation of immune complexes in the circulation , which are then deposited within the kidney ."
renal involvement is one of the diagnostic features of bacterial endocarditis .,virtually all organisms that cause endocarditis also produce renal involvement ( table ) .
"the usual renal manifestations of sbe are asymptomatic proteinuria , hematuria , and pyuria .","loin pain , hypertension , nephrotic syndrome , and renal failure may occur in more severe cases ."
electron microscopy reveals typical electron - dense deposits along the gbm and within the mesangium .,"immunofluorescent studies show glomerular deposits of igg , igm , iga , and c3 along the gbm and within the mesangium ."
"serum c3 level is usually low , and complement can be found within both the circulating and the deposited immune complexes .",these features all support an immune - complex - mediated pathogenesis of the renal injury .
treatment of the endocarditis with antibiotics usually results in resolution of the gn and is associated with the disappearance of immune complexes from the circulation and return of c3 levels to normal .,"the prognosis of the renal lesions in sbe generally depends on the response of the underlying endocarditis to antibiotics or , in cases of antibiotic failure , to surgical removal of the infective vegetations ."
the prognosis for the renal lesion is good if the infection is treated early .,"this usually involves removal of the infected shunt or replacement of a va with a vp shunt and administration of appropriate antibiotics , though possible progression to end - stage renal disease requires frequent renal monitoring of patients with ventriculoatrial shunts ."
"with increasing application of molecular techniques , it may be that a significant proportion of gns currently considered to be idiopathic will ultimately be shown to be virus induced .",most viruses causing systemic infection may trigger immunologically mediated renal injury .
"there are an estimated four million acute cases per year , and per year % of carriers ( one million ) die from cirrhosis , chronic active hepatitis , or primary hepatocellular carcinoma .","the infection is most common in africa and the orient , where it is acquired in childhood by vertical transmission from infected mothers or by horizontal transmission from other children or adults ."
"infection with hbv may result in either a selflimited infectious hepatitis followed by clearance of the virus and complete recovery , or a chronic or persistent infection in which the immune response is ineffective in eliminating the virus .",chronic hbv infection with continued presence of viral antigens in the circulation caused by an ineffective host immune response provides the bestdocumented example of immunologically mediated renal injury caused by persistent infection .
hbv is now the major cause of membranous gn ( mgn ) in children worldwide .,"the proportion of patients with mgn caused by hbv is directly related to the incidence of hbsag in the population , with - 100 % of all cases of mgn in some african and oriental countries being associated with hbv ( see chap ."
"hbsag and hbcag are usually present in the circulation , and hbe antigenemia is seen in a high proportion of cases .","occasionally , hbsag may be found in the glomeruli but is absent from the circulation ."
"passive trapping of circulating immune complexes may be involved , but the circulating immune complexes containing hbsag are usually larger than would be eected to penetrate the basement membrane .","immunologic deposition of hbv and antibody in the glomerular capillary wall is clearly involved in the glomerular injury , but the underlying immunologic events are incompletely understood ."
"in several countries where hbv is common , the proportion of patients with these forms of nephritides who test positive for hbv greatly exceeds the incidence of positivity in the general population .",both mpgn and mesangial proliferative gn may be triggered by hbv .
there are isolated case reports of pegylated interferon successfully treating iga nephropathy associated with hbv .,there have been some promising results with newer antiviral agents such as adefovir and entecavir in treating hbv glomerulonephritis in combination regimens .
renal failure may develop in - 100 % of patients who have mpgn .,cryoglobulinemia is a common accompaniment of gn that is associated with the depression of serum complement levels .
"in fulminant cases , immunosuppressive therapy with steroids , and cyclophosphamide , or rituximab may be needed to control life - threatening vasculitis prior to antiviral treatment .","in some cases , exacerbation and rarely new onset of vasculitis of the peripheral nervous system have been described after this treatment ."
"transmission of the virus requires eure to infected body fluids such as breast milk , saliva , urine , or blood .",individuals initially infected with cmv may be asymptomatic or display nonspecific flulike symptoms .
the clinical manifestations of cmv - induced renal disease in congenitally infected infants are variable and range from asymptomatic proteinuria to nephrotic syndrome and renal impairment .,"in congenital cmv infection , histologic changes of viral inclusions commonly occur in the tubules ."
"beyond the acute allograft nephropathy associated with cmv viremia , cmv is known to cause chronic vascular injury .","cmv glomerular vasculopathy in the absence of tubulointerstitial disease , causing renal allograft dysfunction , has also been reported ."
quantitative plasma pcr testing ( pcr viral load ) is increasingly used for diagnosis and monitoring of cmv viremia in renal transplant recipients .,"the american society of transplantation ( ast ) recommends monitoring for cmv by quantitative viral load monthly for the first year after transplantation , and the kidney disease improving global outcomes ( kdigo ) recommends an additional monthly surveillance for the second year ."
"however , the identification of ebv dna in the kidney raises the possibility that direct infection might play a role .",it is usually caused by interstitial nephritis that is likely the result of immunopathologic injury precipitated by epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) infection .
subclinical infection occurs in - 40 % of pediatric renal transplant recipients .,latent infection of ebv in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells has been described as causing idiopathic chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis .
the herpes simplex virus ( hsv ) causes persistent infection characterized by asymptomatic latent periods interspersed with acute relapses .,"as with other chronic and persistent infections , immunologically mediated disorders triggered by hsv are well recognized , and it is perhaps surprising that hsv has rarely been linked to nephritis ."
"since the development of antiretroviral therapy ( art ) , however , the incidence of end - stage renal disease in hiv infection in both adults and children in industrialized countries has declined , but it is predicted that the dramatic decline in aids - related deaths will lead to an ageing population of hiv - infected individuals who will be at risk of non - hiv - related renal problems , such that the numbers of hiv - positive esrd patients will increase in the united states .",the renal involvement occurs in - 15 % of hiv - infected children in the united states .
intratubular obstruction with crystal precipitation can occur with the use of sulfonamides and intravenous acyclovir .,"acute tubular necrosis has also been reported in hiv patients after the use of nephrotoxic drugs such as pentamidine , foscarnet , cidofovir , amphotericin b , and aminoglycosides ."
"this appears to be true in children as well , but the data are sparse .","in adults in the united states , there is a markedly increased risk of nephropathy among african american persons with hiv infection ."
"there is microcystic distortion of tubule segments , which contributes to increasing kidney size .","podocyte hyperplasia can become so marked that it causes obliteration of much of the urinary space , forming "" pseudocrescents "" ."
"proviral dna has been detected by pcr in the glomeruli , tubules , and interstitium of microdissected kidneys from patients who had pathologic evidence of hivan , but it has also been detected in the kidneys of hiv - positive patients with other glomerulopathies and in those with undetectable levels of viral rna in the peripheral blood .",the kidney has been postulated to behave as a separate compartment to the blood with ongoing viral replication in the kidneys despite achieving serological suppression with art .
"animal models have shown that the nef and vpr genes contribute to hivan through encoding for podocyte dysfunction and apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells , respectively .",these mice do not produce infectious virus but eress the hiv envelope and regulatory genes at levels sufficient to recreate the hivan that is seen in humans .
the immune complexes consist of hiv antigens bound to igg and iga .,"iga nephropathy , membranous and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis , and a lupus - like glomerulonephritis are included in hivck ."
"therefore , it is essential that children on art have regular urinalysis to check for the emergence of proteinuria and hematuria .",tenofovir can cause proximal tubular nephropathy and can present as complete or partial fanconi syndrome .
"there are reports of spontaneous regression of hivan with supportive management and treatment with haart , particularly with regimens containing protease inhibitors .",the kidneys of transgenic mice have been found to have elevated levels of tgf - messenger rna and protein .
"the incidence of peritonitis varies across studies , but some studies did report a higher incidence of pseudomonas and fungal peritonitis in the hiv - positive population .","infections with unusual organisms such as pasteurella multocida , trichosporon beigelii , and mycobacterium avium - intracellulare complex have also been reported ."
kidney transplantation in hiv - infected individuals with end - stage renal disease has shown excellent - 5 - year survival rates .,these group of patients do eerience an increase risk of rejection but not of opportunistic infections .
"jcv establishes latency mainly in the kidney , and its reactivation can result in the development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy .",bkv - associated nephropathy is a cause of renal dysfunction in renal transplantation patients .
the peak incidence of primary infection ( as measured by acquisition of antibody ) occurs in children - 5 years of age .,seroprevalence rates as high as - 80 % have been reported among adults in the united states and europe .
the most frequently recognized secondary sites of latent infection are renal and uroepithelial cells .,"reactivation and urinary shedding occurs in - 60 % of immunocompetent individuals , with higher rates among the immunocompromised ."
"bkv nephritis has a bimodal distribution , with % of bkv - related interstitial nephritis cases occurring - 8 weeks after transplantation and the remainder of patients developing disease months to years after transplantation .",allograft failure is due mainly to extensive viral replication in tubular epithelial cells leading to frank tubular necrosis .
"the presence of well - demarcated basophilic or amphophilic intranuclear viral inclusions , primarily within the tubular and parietal epithelium of the bowman capsule , can help distinguish bkv disease from rejection .","this constellation of histologic features , particularly severe tubulitis , is often misinterpreted as rejection , even by the eerienced pathologist ."
other implications of bk virus in renal transplantation bkv infection may cause ureteral obstruction due to ureteral ulceration and stenosis at the ureteric anastomosis .,bkv - associated ureteral stenosis has been reported in % of renal transplant patients and usually occurs between and days after transplantation .
there are two case reports in children of renal carcinomas arising in the transplanted kidney in association with bk virus nephropathy .,"it remains unclear whether bk virus itself has oncogenic potential in the transplant setting , but this is possible given that the big t antigen ( t - ag ) eressed by polyomavirus family viruses has been shown to have the ability to disrupt chromosomal integrity ."
"review of the literature suggests that careful reduction of immune suppression , combined with active surveillance for rejection , will result in clinical improvement .","reduction in immunosuppression may precipitate episodes of acute cellular rejection , which need to be judiciously treated with corticosteroids ."
"several studies have sought to identify a particular immunosuppressant or combination of drugs that increases the risk of bk virus , but results have not favored one particular regimen over another .","cyclosporin , mycophenolate , and sirolimus have all been shown to possess in vitro antiviral activity against bk virus , but these findings have not been confirmed by in vivo clinical trials ."
"viral hemorrhagic fevers have many clinical similarities but also important differences in their severity , major organs affected , prognosis , and response to treatment .","aerosol and nosocomial transmissions from infected patients are important for lassa , junin , machupo , and congo - crimean hemorrhagic fevers and marburg and ebola viruses ."
"renal manifestations include oliguria , proteinuria , hematuria , and rising urea and creatinine .","aki occurs in patients with severe shock , primarily as a result of renal underperfusion ."
"there is no specific antiviral treatment , and management of patients with dengue shock syndrome or dengue hemorrhagic fever depends on aggressive circulatory support and volume replacement with colloid and crystalloid .",the diagnosis of dengue is made by isolation of the virus from blood or by serologic testing .
"yellow fever is caused by a flavivirus and is transmitted by mosquito bites , typically aedes species .",it remains an important public health problem in africa and south america .
"the role of immunoglobulin has also been tried , but no case - control trials have been conducted to support a beneficial effect .",randomized controlled trials are needed in a setting with full supportive care to further address this question .
"however , in severe cases , with shock , bleeding , and renal failure , dialysis and intensive circulatory support may be required .","in mildly affected patients , the disease is self - limiting , and spontaneous recovery occurs ."
"ribavirin is active against hantaan viruses in vitro , and clinical trials indicate that both mortality and morbidity can be reduced by treatment with this antiviral agent if it is administered early in the course of illness .",dosages of mg / kg followed by mg / kg every h for days and then mg / kg every h for days have been used .
"onset is with high fever , headache , sore throat , myalgia , and profound prostration .","an erythematous rash on the trunk is followed by hemorrhagic conjunctivitis , bleeding , impaired renal function , shock , and respiratory failure ."
there are no reports of a significant direct renal pathology with these viruses .,the latter only appears to have the greatest clinical impact when present in combination with other viruses .

"renal involvement from measles virus is uncommon , although measles virus can be cultured from the kidney in fatal cases .",an acute gn has been reported to follow measles with evidence of immune deposits containing measles virus antigen within the glomeruli .
"mumps virus may be isolated from urine during the first days of the illness , at a time when urinalysis findings are abnormal .","one - third of children with mumps have abnormal urinalysis results , with microscopic hematuria or proteinuria ."
most coronavirus infections are mild respiratory infections with no renal involvement .,"two highly pathogenic species are described , with renal cell tropism , and the renal effects of infection require further elucidation ."
"sars - cov enters cells via angiotensinconverting enzyme ( ace2 ) , and it is thought that the invasion of the kidney tissue reflects the virus ' tropism for ace2 , which is eressed on kidney cells .",sars - cov has been found in the kidney tissue at postmortem .
chronic eure to infectious agents is a major factor in the increased prevalence of glomerular diseases in developing countries .,"malaria is the best - documented parasitic infection associated with glomerular disease , but other parasitic infections including schistosomiasis , filariasis , leishmaniasis , and possibly helminth infections may also induce nephritis or nephrosis ."
the association of p . malariae ( quartan ) malaria and nephritis has been well known in both temperate and tropical zones since the end of the nineteenth century .,malaria is estimated to cause up to million clinical cases of illness and more than one million deaths each year .
the frequent occurrence of p . malariae in the blood of these patients led to detailed epidemiologic studies that implicated malaria as a cause of the nephrosis .,chronic renal disease was a major cause of morbidity and mortality in british guiana in the s .
"the incidence of p . malariae parasitemia in patients with the nephrotic syndrome in nigeria was vastly in excess of that occurring in the general population , whereas the incidence of plasmodium falciparum parasitemia was similar to that in the general population .",the age distribution of nephrotic syndrome also closely paralleled that of p . malariae infection .
"immunofluorescent studies show granular deposits of immunoglobulin , complement , and p . malariae antigen in approximately one - third of patients .","the prognosis for the nephrotic syndrome in most african studies has been poor , regardless of whether the histologic findings were typical of quartan malaria nephropathy or whether p . malariae parasitemia was implicated ."
"most likely , a number of different infectious processes , including malaria , hepatitis b , schistosomiasis , and perhaps other parasitic infections that cause chronic or persistent infections and often occur concurrently in malaria areas , may all result in glomerular injury and a range of overlapping histopathologic features .","the variable patterns of renal disease throughout africa may no longer reflect a dominant role for "" malarial glomerulopathy , "" and the relative causative role of tropical infections in nephropathy remains an unanswered question ."
epidemiologic studies have failed to show a clear association between parasitemia and the nephrotic syndrome .,"whereas renal failure appears to be a common complication of severe malaria in adults , it seldom occurs in children ."
"deposits of igm , with or without igg , are localized mainly in the mesangial areas .","plasmodium falciparum antigens can be demonstrated in the mesangial areas and along the capillary wall , which suggests an immune - complex gn ."
"however in the light of this trial , routine volume eansion with colloid or crystalloid is currently not recommended for children with severe malaria in settings where intensive care monitoring and support is not available .","as the trial was conducted in african countries where ventilator support was not available , it is not clear that the findings can be extrapolated to settings where ventilator support and modern intensive care are available ."
"the term blackwater fever refers to the combination of severe hemolysis , hemoglobinuria , and renal failure .",it was more common at the start of the twentieth century in nonimmune individuals receiving intermittent quinine therapy for p . falciparum malaria .
"schistosoma mansoni is widespread in africa , south america , and southwest asia .","schistosoma japonicum is found only in the orient , whereas schistosoma haematobium occurs throughout africa , the middle east , and areas of southwest asia ."

", 7 government , especially city government , can take the lead to address this lack of progress and widespread population health burden .","using an algorithm from the substance abuse and mental health services administration and data from the new york city health and nutrition examination survey - 14 , we estimate that one in fi ve adults in new york city had a mental illness in the past months ."
"compared with adult new yorkers without depression , those who have depression are less likely to be employed ( 39 % vs %) , three times more likely to report fair or poor general health ( 54 % vs %) , and six times more likely to report fair or poor mental health ( 62 % vs %) .","yet , less than % of adults with symptoms of depression received mental health treatment in the past months , with foreign born and poorer new yorkers even less likely to receive support ."

"notably , by comparing data based on annual reports with data from the maternal and child health surveillance system , wang and colleagues noted that under - reporting of deaths happens in the maternal and child health surveillance system to some extent .","however , the eff ect that under - reporting might have had on the conclusions drawn from this study needs further investigation and discussion ."
"the polar amino acids most commonly found within transmembrane ot helices are cys , thr , and ser .","because gly possesses the smallest of all the side chains , it may play a role in mediating helix - helix interactions and packing in the membrane ."
the result is that there is a degree of indeterminacy in where the ends of transmembrane helices should be drawn ; the precise ends of transmembrane ~ helices are often not known .,"either way , if about residues are required to span the hydrophobic core of the bilayer , the total helix length could be up to residues ."
the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer would have to be about a to locate the two interhelical loops and lys - 972 at the lumenal surface ( fig .,"further , it locates a lys residue ( lys - 972 ) totally within the hydrocarbon core , which seems unlikely ."
"the net result is that the presence of a protein will lead to decreased order for the chains , with a wide range of chain orientations relative to the bilayer normal , but with reduced extent and rate of motion .","however , the chains will have to tilt and become conformationally disordered to maximize contact with the rough surface of the protein ."
", the rotational disorder of the chains being necessary to obtain good van der waals contacts with the molecularly rough surface of the bacteriorhodopsin trimer .","lipids on the extracellular side of the membrane are better resolved than ~ figure structures of four phospholipid molecules identified in x - ray crystallographic studies of bacteriorhodopsin ( belrhali et al . , ) ."
"for example , one lipid molecule forms a hydrogen bond from its ether oxygens to a tyrosine - - oh group at the end of a transmembrane a helix ( fig .",the crystal structure also makes clear the very different conformations adopted by the various lipid molecules located on the surface of the tfimer .
"this is also seen in fluctuations of the lipids , with lipids on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane fluctuating more strongly than those on the extracellular side ( edholm et al . , ) .",the molecular dynamics simulation agrees with eeriment in predicting higher order for both the lipids and the protein on the extracellular side of the membrane ; fluctuations in the loops and the ends of helices on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane are greater than on the extracellular side .
"static and dynamic disorder give rise to very different electron spin resonance ( esr ) spectra for spin - labeled lipids , and esr spectra for membrane protein systems usually show two components , one "" immobilized , "" corresponding to boundary lipid , and one relatively mobile , corresponding to bulk lipid ( devaux and seigneuret , ; marsh , ) .","studies with oriented samples have confirmed a wide range of orientational distributions for the boundary lipid , in contrast to the bulk lipid phase , where motion of the lipid long axis is about the bilayer normal ( jost et al . , ; pates and marsh , ) ."
when the thickness of the bilayer is less than the hydrophobic length of the peptide the lipid chains must be stretched .,"most models of hydrophobic mismatch assume that the lipid chains in the vicinity of the protein adjust their length to that of the protein , with the protein acting as a rigid body ."
the resulting profile of energy of interaction as a function of hydrophobic mismatch was fairly symmetrical about the point of zero mismatch .,"the term due to the headgroup region was treated as an interracial free energy , including an attractive term associated with eure of the hydrocarbon core to the aqueous medium and a repulsive term due to electrostatic and excluded - volume interactions between the headgroups ( excluded - volume interactions signify that no two atoms can occupy the same position in space ) ."
"where dp and dl are the hydrophobic thicknesses of the protein and lipid bilayer , respectively , and the unperturbed bilayer thickness is / ~ .",the hydrophobic thickness of a bilayer of phosphatidylcholine in the liquid crystalline phase is given by
it is also assumed that all the lipid perturbation energy is concentrated in the first shell of lipids around the protein .,it is assumed that the protein is very large and so appears fiat to a lipid molecule .
"changes in interaction energies of and kj mo1 - 1 correspond to decreases in the lipid - protein binding constant by factors of and n , respectively .","if the change in lipid - protein interaction energy were to propagate out from the protein surface to affect more than the first shell of lipids , effects of hydrophobic mismatch would be reduced ."
"the most important energy terms were found to be the splay energy and the compression - eansion term , the splay energy term being most important close to the protein , with the compression - eansion term being more import ' ant further from the protein .","even though the bilayer deformation was calculated to extend some a from the protein , most of the deformation was found concentrated in the component immediately adjacent to the protein ."
"thus , effects of mismatch calculated in this way are similar to those calculated using the approach of fattal and ben - shaul .","the calculations showed that , for a protein of hydrophobic thickness a , which matches a bilayer ofdi ( c :0 ) pc in the liquid crystalline state , the binding constant for di ( c14 :0 ) pc is about a factor of greater than for a bilayer of di ( c18 :0 ) pc , which will give a bilayer too thick by a ( sperotto and mouritsen , ) ."
"this is consistent with hydrophobic matching models ; because di ( c :0 ) pc gives a too thin bilayer in the liquid crystalline phase , bacteriorhodopsin favors the gel phase , whereas di ( c18 :0 ) pc gives a too thick bilayer in the gel phase , so that bacteriorhodopsin favors the liquid crystalline phase .","for example , although bacteriorhodopsin has relatively little effect on the phase transition temperatures of di ( c14 :0 ) pc or di ( c16 :0 ) pc ( alonso et al . , ) , it increases the transition temperature of di ( c12 :0 ) pc and decreases that of di ( c18 :0 ) pc ( piknova etal . , ) ."
a number of studies have used peptides of the type ac - k2 - g - ln - k2 - a - amide ( pn ) consisting of a long sequence of hydrophobic leu residues capped at both the n - and c - terminal ends with a pair of charged lysine residues .,"the poly ( leu ) region forms a maximally stable u helix , particularly in the hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer ."
this agrees with estimates from molecular modeling that about - 18 lipid molecules will be required to form a complete bilayer shell around the peptide .,"at molar ratios of lipid less than this , non - bilayer phases can be induced , particularly when the hydrophobic length of the peptide is less than the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer and when the peptide contains interfacial aromatic groups ( de planque et al . , ; killian et al . , ; morein et al . , ) ."
this kind of interaction will obviously not be possible with a single transmembrane u helix .,shows the two chains interacting predominantly with two different transmembrane u helices .
"similarly , nezil and bloom estimated that the peptide p24 increased the thickness of a bilayer of ( c16 :0 , c18 : 1 ) pc by just / ~ , despite the hydrophobic mismatch between the peptide and the lipid bilayer being ca .","thus , addition of a peptide aw2 ( la ) tw2a to bilayers of di ( c12 :0 ) pc in the liquid crystalline phase resulted in only a - / ~ increase in thickness ( de planque et al . , ) , whereas about an - / ~ increase would be necessary for the bilayer thickness to match the hydrophobic length of the peptide ."
"effects of peptides on chain order will depend on the relative hydrophobic length of the peptide compared to the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer , with long peptides decreasing order and short peptides increasing order , and such effects have been detected using infrared ( ir ) spectroscopy , but again effects were small ( zhang et al . , a ) .","thus it appears that lipids will distort slightly to improve the match between the hydrophobic length of the peptide and the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer , but the extent of these modifications is very limited and much less than required to produce full matching ."
"however , deuterium nmr spectra of mixtures of p24 and di ( c :0 ) pc above and below the phase transition are typical of liquid crystalline - and gel - phase lipids , respectively , with no evidence for any "" special "" lipid unable to take part in the phase transition .","similarly , as already described , esr spectra of spin - labeled lipids show the presence of a single type of lipid in the system , not separate bulk and boundary lipids in slow exchange ( subczynski et al . , ) ."
"the n - and c - terminal regions of the ot helix , located in the lipid headgroup region , were less stable and fluctuated more , because of transient hydrogen bonding between the peptide bond amide hydrogen and the phosphate or fatty acyl ester oxygen atoms and the water ; as a result , the ends of the helices become frayed .","the central residues ( ala - 12 - 26 ) , which interacted just with the lipid fatty acyl chains , remained as a stable t helix ."
the helix was tilted up to with respect to the bilayer normal .,"because the helix contains no resides that would make strong contacts in the headgroup region or with water , there is no reason for it not to tilt ( shen et al . , ) ."
"since the average distance between lipid headgroups is a , this puts these lipids in the "" second "" shell around the peptide .","however , the headgroup , as given by the position of the phosphorus atom , could be up to - 18 a away ."
the regular structure of a poly ( ala ) peptide compared to the rough surface of a typical or - helical peptide might also contribute to the lack of an immobilization shell of lipids .,"however , a significant factor is also likely to be the lack of polar groups at the ends of the peptide able to interact with the phospholipid headgroups ."
"similarly , in a simulation of the seventh transmembrane c ~ helix of the serotonin ht receptor in di ( c :0 ) pc , lipids in contact with the peptide had slightly higher order parameters than bulk lipids ( duong et al . , ) .","fatty acyl chains next to the transmembrane helix were slightly more ordered than bulk lipids ( roux and woolf , ) ."
the theories described above show that there will be an energetic cost associated with any change in the thickness of a bilayer .,this would be reflected in values for the equilibrium constant describing the binding of lipids to the protein .
"the results can be analyzed to give relative lipid - binding constants , as described in webb et al .",this shows that di ( c : i ) pc binds more strongly to the peptide than does di ( c14 : 1 ) pc .
"in contrast to the results with l16 , peptide f2l14 incorporated fully into bilayers of di ( c24 : 1 ) pc , and y2li4 partitioned partially into di ( c24 : 1 ) pc .","possible effects of aromatic residues at the ends of transmembrane ~ helices have been studied using peptides k2gfl6wl8fk2a ( f2l14 ) and k2gyl6wl8yk2a ( y2li4 ) , in which one leu residue at each end of the poly ( leu ) stretch is replaced by either a phe or a tyr ( mall et al . , ) ."
"this contrasts with l22 , which shows markedly stronger interaction with di ( c22 : l ) pc than with phospholipids with shorter or longer chains .",this again suggests that the introduction of the two tyr residues leads to an increase in the thickness of the bilayer with which optimal interaction of the peptide is observed .
"at ph , phosphatidic acid bears a single negative charge ( cevc , ) .","the binding constant for phosphatidic acid changed little with ionic strength , suggesting that the interaction with the positively charged peptide did not follow simply from a high positive potential in the vicinity of the positively charged lys residues on the peptide , increasing the local concentration of anionic phospholipid ."
"assuming a dielectric constant of ( water ) , we find that an energy of interaction of kj tool corresponds to a distance of separation between two monovalent ions of / ~ .","where zl and z2 are the charges on the two ions eo is the permittivity of a vacuum , er is the relative permittivity ( dielectric constant ) of the medium , and r is the distance between the two ions ."
"in contrast to l16 , the binding constants for anionic phospholipids to l22 are very similar to those for zwitterionic phospholipids , with a relative binding constant close to .","for phosphatidylserine , the presence of the positively charged ammonium group as well as the negatively charged carboxyl group in the headgroup region may reduce interaction with the positively charged peptide ."
this suggests that the presence of the tyr residues prevents close association of the anionic phospholipid group with the cationic lys residues .,"however , in this case the eeriments are consistent with a model in which the binding constants for all the anionic phospholipid molecules binding to the peptide are increased slightly ( mall et al . , ) ."
these results suggest that the effects of charge on the interactions between phospholipids and transmembrane ot helices will often be rather small and will be strongly dependent on the detailed structure of the peptide and its orientation in the membrane .,"this picture is consistent with the results of the molecular dynamics simulations of individual ~ helices of bacteriorhodopsin in bilayers of di ( ci4 :0 ) pc , which showed that a small proportion of the lipid molecules interacted with the o ~ helices much more strongly than the others , and that these strong interactions were dominated by electrostatic terms rather than van der waals terms ( woolf , ) ."
"however , there is evidence for the presence of a small number of "" special "" anionic phospholipids binding to some membrane proteins , acting as "" cofactors . ""","an example is provided by cytochrome c oxidase , whose crystal structure shows the presence of a lipid molecule bound between the transmembrane a helices ( iwata et al . , ) ."
this is consistent with the eectation that van der waals contacts between an all - trans fatty acyl chain and the molecularly rough surface of a peptide will be poor ; one way that this poor packing can be overcome is by exclusion of the peptide from the gel phase .,quenching plots for y2l14 are very similar to those of l16 ( fig .
"incorporation of cholesterol at a : molar ratio to phospholipid leads to a general reduction in incorporation of the peptides l16 and l22 , but superimposed on this effect is a chain length effect .","the presence of cholesterol has a marked effect on incorporation of the peptides into phospholipid bilayers ( webb et al . , ) ."
"this is rather surprising , given the relatively rigid structure of the steroid ring of cholesterol and the molecularly rough surface of the peptide .","in other studies , it has been shown that cholesterol binds relatively weakly at the lipid - protein interface of the atpase ( simmonds et al . , ( simmonds et al . , , ; comparison with the peptide studies reported here suggests that weak binding of cholesterol to the atpase involves interactions in the lipid headgroup region rather than interactions between the sterol ring and the hydrophobic transmembrane helices ."
"in the bulk flow model , the vast majority of proteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) are believed to leave the er by default and flow along the ecytic pathway until they reach the plasma membrane ( nilsson and warren , ) .",targeting of proteins to their correct final destinations in a cell is essential in maintaining cell integrity .
"similarly , a - residue insertion into the transmembrane domain of galactosyltransferase reduced its retention in the golgi ( masibay et al . , ) .","the reverse effect has been shown with the influenza virus neuraminidase , which shifted from the plasma membrane to the golgi and er when the number of residues in the transmembrane domain was reduced ( sivasubramanian and nayak , ) ."
"studies of targeting of proteins in yeast are also consistent with a lipid - based model ( rayner and pelham , ) .","the length of the transmembrane domain is important in targeting with long helices ( 24 residues ) , ensuring transport to the plasma membrane ."
"if the length of the hydrophobic stretch is increased to residues , the protein is transported out of the er along the secretory pathway ( pedrazzini et al . , ) .","for example , cytochrome bs , a protein of this type , has a transmembrane domain containing just hydrophobic amino acid residues ( pedrazzini et al . , ) ."
"in the case of the ca2 + - atpase it seems that , as described above , the two major conformational states of the atpase ( el and e2 ) have different preferences for bilayer thickness , the e1 conformation favoring thin bilayers and the e2 conformation favoring thick bilayers ( lee , ) .","changes in the atpase underlying these changes in atpase activity are complex ( lee , ) , but all must be mediated by the transmembrane ot helices , because these are the parts of the atpase that can "" sense "" the change in bilayer thickness ."

"moreover , sequence analysis of sumo - hkgf - 2 fusion gene showed that it contained up to % of codons rarely used in e . coli , suggesting that rare codons may restrict the eression of fusion protein .","to overcome this problem , rosetta tm ( de3 ) host strain which is a bl21 derivative was designed to enhance the eression of eukaryotic proteins that contain codons rarely used in e . coli by supplying trnas for seven rare codons ( aga , agg , aua , cua , gga , ccc , and cgg ) on a compatible chloramphenicolresistant plasmid ."
"moreover , since both sumo fusion protein and sumo contained an n - terminal his tag , hkgf - 2 could be readily and rapidly purified from the cleaved sumo - hkgf - 2 samples by re - applying the cleaved samples to the ni - nta column .","as a his tag was fused at n - terminal of sumo - hkgf - 2 , one - step purification with ni - nta affinity chromatography was used to purify fusion protein ."

actual knowledge did not prevent irrational perceptions or promote safe behavior .,"rather , readiness to adopt protective behavior depended on subjective knowledge and overconfidence in ability to self - protect ."
recommendations typically emphasize the need to increase actual knowledge ( what persons really know ) to reduce irrational beliefs and risky behavior .,"however , subjective knowledge ( what persons think they know ) , which has been overlooked in evd surveys , can lead to the erroneous feeling that one has the requisite knowledge to avoid adverse events , resulting in a higher risk of eeriencing negative outcomes ."

"however , travelers with greater actual knowledge were not more likely to view protective measures as efficient , to avoid positive illusions , or to intend to engage in protective behavior .","actual knowledge was associated only with higher perceived seriousness of the disease and lower awareness of risk for evd in the country of destination , which reflects some rational perceptions ( evd is indeed serious , and most destination countries for this sample population were not affected by the epidemic ) ."
persons ' belief that they know how to protect themselves when they actually do not and the feeling of knowing added to a feeling of overconfidence in how to self - protect might result in risky rather than safe behavior .,"the fact that subjective knowledge and positive illusions , but not actual knowledge , were associated with protective behavior intentions is problematic , especially because actual knowledge was low ."
our results indicate that not considering subjective knowledge and positive illusions can lead to the erroneous conclusion that increasing actual knowledge will necessarily translate into behavioral change and good practices .,evd communication would benefit from research showing that promoting behavioral change requires changing subjective evaluations of risk to make it self - relevant and to induce a reappraisal of the perceived benefits of ( or costs of not ) performing safe behavior .

"the oligosaccharide side chains contain characteristic monosaccharides : galactose , fucose , n - acetylheamines and sialic acids , but no uronic acids and little mannose ( carlstedt et al . , ; strous and dekker , ; forstner and forstner , ) .",repetition of these regions amplifies the overall proportion of carbohydrate within the molecule .
"these carbohydrate motifs are present on secreted mucins , depending on an individual ' s secretor status .",the specificity of this glycosylation is reflected in the fidelity of blood group antigen eression for each individual .
"the precise cellular origin of each mucin cannot be determined from the mixture found in tears , conjunctival homogenates or whole eye washings .","it is possible that shedding of membrane - bound mucins may contribute to the adherent gel layer of the tear film , but there is much more evidence for conjunctival goblet cells being the major producers of secreted ocular mucins ."
"it has been suggested that the maturation of mucin granules in goblet cells takes around weeks ( aitken et al . , ) .","biomicroscopy of these cells in vivo and in vitro suggests that they are derived from other goblet cells within a small number of cell divisions ( chen et al . , ; zieske , ; dartt et al . , ; kessler et al . , ; wei et al . , ) ."
"analysis of mucins within these cysts will help to differentiate which types of mucin are derived from goblet cells , and which are derived from squamous cells .",it will also provide a basis for examining whether staining differences between cells relates to cell maturation .

"mucins allow non - specific interactions with many particulates and chemicals at the ocular surface , enabling their neutralization or removal .","the bulk carbohydrate properties of mucins are complemented by the eression of specific carbohydrate structures , which act as ligands in cell or pathogen adhesion ( rogers et al . , ; shimizu and shaw , ; schultze and herrler , ; yolken et al . , ; lasky , ; van klinken et al . , ) ."
"ocular mucins , rich in sialic acid , may present themselves as binding partners in such mechanisms : influenza virus , coronavirus and rotavirus commonly bind to receptor sialic acids in intestinal mucins ( rogers et al . , ; chen et al . , ; schultze and herrler , ; yolken et al . , ) .","however , sialic acids also afford mucins protection from microbial proteolytic degradation ( nieuw - amerongen et al . , ) ."
"in general , the diversity of oligosaccharide structures present within mucins offers a considerable scope for specific interactions ( ramphal and pyle , ; ritchings et ai . , ) with potential microbial pathogens .",the interactions between ocular flora and pathogens remain to be fully elored .
"synthesis of mucins by the classical and the non - goblet cell pathways ( section ) may share many processes , but probably differs in the modes of storage , targeting and secretion .","incomplete knowledge of the structure , assembly , packaging and secretion of these molecules precludes a reliable overview of the biosynthetic processes for any mucosal system ."
"compartmentalization at each stage allows the optimal interaction of a selected group of glycosyltransferases with the mucin apoproteins , giving rise to fully glycosylated mucins .","antiporters ensure a sufficient supply of nucleotide sugars for glycosylation ( carlstedt et al . , , schachter and brockhausen , ; brockhausen , ) ."
"the addition of n - linked oligosaccharide chains targets the mucin precursors to the correct subcellular compartments for subsequent o - glycosylation ( dekker and strous , ; hilkens et al . , ) .","separation of different mucins into vesicles destined for distinct constitutive and stimulated pathways has been demonstrated in cultured colonic cells ( mccool et al . , ) ."
mucins are stored in goblet vesicles under conditions that regulate their water binding .,"the precise nature of this packaging is not fully understood , but is thought to include ion - binding ( verdugo , ) and disulphide bridge formation related to von willebrand domains gum , ) ."
"regulation of the proportion of different mucins may occur at the level of biosynthesis , release from individual secretory granules or release from individual goblet cells .","these may arise from separate populations of vesicles within individual goblet cells , or from subpopulations of goblet cells eressing different mucins ."
"osmolarity has also been identified as a factor controlling goblet cell vesicles and the overall integrity of goblet cells in conjunctival tissue ( huang et al . , ) .","this pattern is distinct from that seen in other mucosae ( forstner , ) ."
"the anchor comprises phosphatidyl inositol , linked to a characteristic glycan and terminating in ethanolamine .","in other tissues , gpi - anchored molecules are attached to apical membranes ( lisanti et ai . , ( lisanti et ai . , , ."
"release of gpi - anchored molecules from surface membranes may be controlled by the action of cellular phospholipases , cleaving at the phosphodiester bonds between inositol and diacylglycerol .","cellular and subcellular location of these molecules in the eye has not been determined , but will be of great interest with regard to glycocalyx targeting , the small vesicle pathway and membrane shedding ."
the gpi - membrane anchor is different to the transmembrane peptide anchor identified for muc1 .,"at present , it is not possible to ascribe these gpi - anchored molecules to any muc products or to other glycoproteins in their size range ."
"although previous studies have used such mucus threads as a principal source of mucin ( moore and tiffany , ; chao et al . , ) , the relation between mucin within the thread and the gel layer of the tear film is not yet clear .","it is not known whether mucin is removed from the ocular surface as an insoluble complex , or as soluble mucin after proteolytic degradation ."
"hyaluronan has been demonstrated in the ocular surface epithelia ( madsen et al . , ; rittig et al . , ) and in tears ( frescura et al . , ) .","there is very little evidence for the presence of specific mucin - degrading enzymes in the tear film , although proteolytic activity has been detected ( sack et al . , ; hamdi et al . , ) as has hyaluronidase ."
this method shows a considerable normal variation in the number of goblet cells in the conjunctivae of rats of very similar age and weight and which have been housed in identical conditions .,"however , adjustment for shrinkage and stretching of the tissue must be made when calculating density ."
"the wide variation in goblet cell impressions from normal controls ( rolando et al . , ) makes comparisons difficult .","although it is straightforward to define the area sampled , it is uncertain as to what proportion of the goblet cells leave an impression on the filter ."
"vernal allergic conjunctivitis , which may be associated with increased mucous discharge , has been studied with impression cytology .","goblet cells are found to be present in increased numbers and produce impressions that are characteristically smaller than in normal controls ( aragona et al . , ) ."
"however , increased tear osmolarity , as in meibomian and lacrimal gland diseases , causes a loss of goblet cells ( gilbard et al . , ( gilbard et al . , , .","loss of goblet cells is associated with secondary dry eye symptoms and decreased tear film break up time ( toda et al . , ) ."
"the superior bulbar conjunctiva revealed no change in kcs patients ( petroutsos et al . , ) .","in keratoconjunctivitis sicca ( kcs ) , reduced numbers of goblet cells were observed in the interpalpebral bulbar conjunctiva , whereas both this area and the inferior tarsal region had reduced goblet cell numbers in ocular cicatricial pemphigoid ( nelson and wright , ) ."
the pathological changes in dry eye may result in structural alterations to the mucins secreted by the conjunctival epithelial cells .,"lectin staining of mucus granules in dry eye patients has suggested a reduction in sialic acids , n - acetyl - glucosamine , n - acetyl - galactosamine and galactose - n - acetylgalactosamine , and an increase in glucose and mannose ( versura et al . , ) ."
we do not know any details of mucin biosynthesis in the normal or diseased eye .,"however , the total number of mucins that are normally present is unknown ."
this chapter presents sensitive biochemical methods that ensure the isolation and purification of the whole complement of ocular mucins .,an understanding of the detailed biochemistry of preocular mucins may hold the key to understanding and manipulating their physiology .
the processing of replicase polyprotein pp1a in the region of nsp1 to nsp3 was not affected .,"transmission electron microscopy showed that , compared to revertant virus , the number of double - membrane vesicles in mhv - brts31 - infected cells is reduced at the nonpermissive temperature ."
coronaviruses are positive - stranded rna viruses with genomes ranging in size from to kb .,approximately twothirds of the genome encodes proteins that are involved in viral rna synthesis .
"a variety of studies suggest that most , if not all , coronavirus nsp ' s are recruited to the viral rtcs , and a complex and dynamic pattern of interactions between intermediate and mature rtc proteins is thought to play a role in the regulation of viral rna synthesis .","hydrophobic transmembrane domains are present in nsp3 , nsp4 , and nsp6 and likely serve to anchor the nascent pp1a / pp1ab polyproteins to membranes during the first steps of rtc formation ( 1 , , , , , ) ."
"however , others ( e . g . , the endoribo - nuclease of nsp15 ) are unique to coronaviruses or viruses closely related to them and may be involved in unusual activities that are related to the size of the coronavirus genome or virus - host interactions .","clearly , some of these activities are common to many rna viruses and are directly related to the biogenesis of the rtc and viral rna synthesis ."
"these domains include amino - terminal ubiquitin - related ( ub1 ) and hypervariable acidic ( ac ) domains , a papain - like cysteine proteinase domain ( plp1 ) , an x domain with poly ( adp - ribose ) binding activity (x or adrp domain ) , a second ubiquitinrelated domain ( ub2 ) , a second papain - like cysteine proteinase domain ( plp2 ) , group specific nucleic acid binding ( nab ) and marker ( g2m ) domains , a transmembrane domain ( tmd ) that includes at least membrane - spanning helices , a putative metal - binding domain ( zf ) , and a carboxyl - terminal y domain that contains three subdomains ( y1 , y2 , and y3 ) with characteristic patterns of conserved cys / his residues .","the nsp3 protein is excised from its precursors , pp1a and pp1ab , by the concerted activity of the plp1 and plp2 domains , with plp1 being responsible for the amino - terminal cleavage ( cleavage site [ cs2 ] ) and plp2 being responsible for the carboxyl - terminal cleavage ( cleavage site [ cs3 ] ) ."
"similarly , mutant mhvs that are unable to liberate nsp1 from the nascent polyprotein ( i . e . , nsp1 / nsp2 cleavage mutants ) and mutant mhvs that lack extensive regions of the nsp1 or , indeed , the entire nsp2 coding region could be rescued but exhibited decreased or delayed replication .","reverse genetics has , for example , been used to introduce mutations at the active site of the coronavirus nsp14 enuclease domain , which results in a failure to rescue recombinant virus or the rescue of mutant viruses with significant growth and rna synthesis defects ."
"one of the main conclusions of this analysis is that mutations in the nsp12 , nsp14 , and nsp16 proteins define distinct cistrons ( cistrons ii , iv , and vi ) while mutations in the nsp4 , nsp5 , and nsp10 proteins define a single cistron ( cistron i ) .","we have recently reported a genetic and functional analysis of a panel of mhv ts mutants that are unable to synthesize viral rna when the infection is initiated and maintained at the nonpermissive temperature , i . e . , mutants with an rna - negative phenotype ."
"finally , the classical genetic approach can be further eloited to provide mechanistic insights into the functional inactivation of nsp ' s at the nonpermissive temperature .","for example , a recent biochemical analysis of the mhv rnanegative mutant la ts6 has suggested that nsp10 acts as a regulatory cofactor of nsp5 proteinase activity ."
"virus stocks were obtained by using virus from a single plaque ( pfu ) to infect cells to yield ml of stock virus , which was then used to infect cells at c for h to yield passage virus stocks with a titer of pfu / ml .",revertant viruses were picked from plaques of mutants whose titers were determined at c and were plaque purified three times at c .
"monolayers were overlaid with mem containing % fcs , u / ml of penicillin , g / ml streptomycin , and % gelrite gellan gum ( sigma - aldrich , poole , dorset , united kingdom ) and incubated at the appropriate temperature with % co .",infected cells were incubated at c for days or c / 39.5 c for days .
"infected cells were incubated at c for h . supernatants were harvested and clarified by centrifugation at , 000 rpm for min .",the virus titer was determined by plaque assay at c .
"viral rna for reverse transcription - pcr ( rt - pcr ) and sequencing was obtained by infecting cl - 1 cells with virus at an moi of , incubating the cells for h at c , and isolating total rna using the trizol reagent as described by the manufacturer .",the replicase gene coding region ( orf1a and orf1b ) of mhv - brts31 and mhv - br31r1 virus ( nucleotides [ nt ] to ) was amplified and sequenced using a set of oligonucleotides ( p1 to p121 ) that are complementary to sequences spaced at approximately - nucleotide intervals along the positive - and negative - strand copies of the viral rna ( sequences available on request ) .
pgpt - nsp3 ( n ) encodes the gpt gene flanked on its left by mhv - a59 nt to and on its right by mhv - a59 nt to .,"first , part of the nsp3 protein coding region within the vmhv - inf - 1 cdna was replaced by the gpt gene using homologous recombination with plasmid pgpt - nsp3 ( n ) ."
"at days and postelectroporation , tissue culture supernatants were taken and recombinant coronaviruses were plaque purified three times .","following electroporation , the transfected bhk - mhv - n cells were mixed with a - fold excess of cl - 1 cells and cultured at c ."
"after h , the medium was replaced with dmem supplemented with % fcs and containing g / ml of actinomycin d . at h postinfection , the medium was replaced with medium lacking methionine and cysteine and supplemented with % dialyzed fetal calf serum .",cl - 1 cells ( cells ) in - mm - diameter cell culture dishes were either mock infected or infected with viruses at an moi of and incubated at c in serum - free medium .
pbs was replaced with m cacodylate - buffered % glutaraldehyde before processing for transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) analysis as previously described .,"briefly , cells fixed in glutaraldehyde were rinsed two times for min each in m cacodylate buffer and postfixed in m cacodylate - buffered % osmium tetroxide for h . after two rinses in buffer , the cells were serially dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol ."
the grids were examined and photographed on a hitachi h600 at kv .,"sections m thick were stained with % toluidine blue , and selected areas were thin sectioned ( 80 nm ) , mounted on copper grids , and stained with % uranyl acetate and reynolds ' lead citrate ."
"first , we determined the amounts of viral rna synthesized in cells infected with mhv - a59 , mhv - brts31 , or mhv - br31r1 and maintained at the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures of c and c , respectively .","figure b shows that at c , all three viruses produce genome - sized and subgenome - sized virus rna in the eected ratios , although the northern blot suggests that mhv - brts31 may synthesize slightly less viral rna than does mhv - a59 or mhv - br31r at the permissive temperature ."
these results show that mhv - brts31 has near - normal levels of total rna synthesis at the permissive temperature .,we have also confirmed that the kinetics and levels of virus rna synthesis in mhv - brts31 - infected cells maintained at the nonpermissive temperature cannot be distinguished from those of mock - infected cells and that cells infected with mhv - br31r1 and mhv - a59 are indistinguishable in terms of virus rna synthesis at the permissive temperature ( data not shown ) .
we conclude that the mhv - br31r1 replicase - transcriptase activity formed before temperature shift is relatively resistant to higher temperature .,"in the presence of cycloheximide , the activity fails to increase , but after shift , significant activity remains ."
we crossed mhv - brts31 with at least one virus from each of these known complementation groups using a classical complementation assay .,"has divided a large panel of rna - negative , ts mutants of mhv into four complementation groups ."
"both mhv - a59 and the revertant mhv - br31r1 have a methionine at this position , showing that mhv - br31r1 is a true revertant .",the numbering system used was that assigned to our infectious clone of the mhv - a59 genome ( genbank accession number ay700211 ) .
"sequence analysis of rna isolated from cl - 1 cells infected with a passage stock of mhv - br31cr1 showed that it was , indeed , a true revertant ( data not shown ) .","next , we determined the amounts of viral rna synthesized in cells infected with mhv - inf - 1 and mhv - brtsc31 and maintained at the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures of c and c , respectively ."
these results were uneected and the first demonstration of a relationship be - tween nsp3 function and pp1a processing by the clpro cysteine protease activity of nsp5 .,"these results indicate that , at the nonpermissive temperature , the replacement of methionine - 475 with isoleucine in nsp3 of mhv - brtsc31 is affecting nsp5 - mediated processing of pp1a and , more specifically , the processing of p150 to generate nsp4 , nsp5 , and nsp8 ."
"three of these groups , groups ii , iv , and vi , were defined by ts viruses with mutations in the orf1b - encoded proteins nsp12 , nsp14 , and nsp16 , respectively , while the fourth group , group i , was defined by ts viruses with mutations in three of the orf1a - encoded proteins , nsp4 , nsp5 , and nsp10 .",this led us to the hypothesis that each of the five mhv orf1b cleavage products ( nsp12 to nsp16 ) may represent distinct cistrons but that the majority of the orf1a cleavage products will function as a single cistron .
"second , although it has been shown that an rna stemloop in the bovine coronavirus ( bcov ) proximal coding region of nsp1 is essential for rna replication ( which would elain the lethality of deleting the entire nsp1 coding region ) , the majority of evidence suggests that the coronavirus nsp1 protein primarily has a role in the virus - host interaction or regulatory , rather than essential , functions in rna synthesis .","first , as mentioned above , extensive deletion of sequences encoding the carboxyl region of nsp1 or , indeed , the entire coding region of nsp2 has an attenuating effect but is not lethal for mhv replication ."
"in this respect , the precedent for protein - protein interactions within the coronavirus rtc that result in a modification of nsp5 activity has been given by donaldson et al .","either there is an interaction between nsp3 and another component of the rtc , which is necessary to facilitate nsp5 - mediated polyprotein processing , or the normal structure or function of nsp3 is needed to provide pp1a / pp1ab substrates upon which nsp5 can act ."
"a quantitative analysis of dmv numbers in cells infected with mhv - brts31 , together with eeriments to determine the turnover rate of dmv structures in mhv - a59 - infected cells , will be needed to determine the precise defect in dmv biogenesis .","however , our data suggest that preformed rtcs are able to continue plus - strand rna synthesis at the nonpermissive temperature , and it seems more likely that the failure to correctly process the replicase polyproteins would affect assembly rather than stability of the rtc ."
"in this context , it is important to note that the data do not allow us to discern whether the phenotypic changes that we observe are directly or indirectly related to the causal mutation .","in the light of these conclusions , the obvious challenge is to identify the specific function or functions of nsp3 that are impaired at the nonpermissive temperature in mhv - brts31 / mhv - brtsc31 - infected cells and to relate this to the phenotype of the mutant virus ."
"for a number of reasons , we consider this the least likely elanation .","for example , we consider it unlikely that inactivation of plp1 activity is responsible for the phenotype of mhv - brts31 ( or mhv - brtsc31 ) ."
"although there is still some uncertainty , the current model of mhv nsp3 topology predicts at least transmembrane helices .",this would place the bulk of nsp3 on the same membrane face occupied by nsp5 and the nsp12 to nsp16 proteins processed from pp1ab .
"here we compare and contrast these three screening approaches for elucidating host - virus interactions , outline their key strengths and weaknesses including a comparison of an arrayed multiple orthologous rnai reagent screen to a pooled crispr / cas9 human rhinovirus - human cell interaction screen , and recount some notable insights made possible by each .",we conclude with a brief perspective on what might lie ahead for the fast evolving field of human - virus functional genomics .
elucidating human pathogenic viral dependencies has been a longstanding pursuit of health science researchers whose goal is to use this knowledge to treat and cure infections .,"for decades , mammalian in vitro tissue culture systems have proved tremendously useful for studying host - virus interactions ."
"collectively these works have identified multiple previously unappreciated dependencies for each virus , as well as host cell defense mechanisms .",rnai screens using human cells have now been done for the majority of major human pathogenic viruses ( table ) ; these efforts have largely used arrayed sirna libraries combined with high - throughput imaging or plate reader - based assays as readouts for viral replication .
"nearing a decade ago the nobel prize winning discovery of rnai in c . elegans and its mercurial extension into mammalian systems provided virologists and geneticists alike with a powerful new tool for detecting viral dependencies ( elbashir et al . , ; fire et al . , ; grishok & mello , ) .","academia and industry both quickly embraced rnai and paired it with the contemporaneous completion of the genetic annotation of the entire human genome to create multiple large - scale libraries for functional genomic screening ( paddison et al . , ; root , hacohen , hahn , lander , & sabatini , ; silva et al . , ) ."
"accordingly , a pooled shrna screen using a cytopathic virus and cell survival as a means of gene enrichment might not find the host receptor for the virus because there will be some low level of receptor eression remaining ( hypomorphism ) that could render the cell susceptible to infection and death .",it is difficult for a single proviral shrna to have enough eression to efficiently deplete the mrna for its intended target .
"for example , a gene targeted by three independent shrnas that are enriched in the nextgen sequencing readout is more likely to be a true positive than a gene targeted by only one enriched shrna .","as we will see , the reagent redundancy principle is also important for selection of candidates using all of these functional genomic screening strategies , including the haploid cell screens ( number of independent retroviral insertions ) ( carette et al . , ) ."
"pioneering work defining human pathogen interactions was done first using insect cell lines and arrayed sirna libraries targeting the drosophila mrna transcriptome ( cherry , ; hao et al . , ; sessions et al . , ) .",the high - throughput transfection of arrayed cdna libraries into mammalian cells for screening predates rnai and this approach was readily emulated once large - scale arrayed rnai reagents and appropriate transfection lipids were developed .
") ; this is usually done in a reverse transfection format with the sirnas and lipid mixture added to the well first , followed by the cells added in suspension .",target mrna depletion and decreased protein eression occurs over - 4 days depending on assay conditions .
"moreover , by depleting just one - gene - per - well an arrayed screen permits the selection of candidate genes based on more subtle gradations in phenotypes than when using pooled screening readouts .",additionally the introduction of large effective concentrations of sirnas into the cells using high efficiency lipid - mediated transfection improves target mrna depletion producing enhanced phenotypic penetrance .
"importantly , silencer select sirnas mark a major advancement in sirna design as they incorporate locked nucleic acids ( lnas ) which increase antisense strand binding affinity to designed targets and inhibit sense - strand binding thereby decreasing otes ( puri et al . , ) .","as with the smartpool library the three individual sirnas available for the validation round are useful and ambion maintains a consistent supply of the library oligos that can be reordered , with new potentially improved sirnas being added without replacing the original library set ."
"esirna pools were originally developed by the buckholz lab and consist of complex heterogeneous mixtures of overlapping sirnas ( 18 - 25 base pairs in length ) targeting the same mrna sequence ( kittler et al . , ) .",esirna pools are created using endoribonuclease to digestion of rna transcribed in vitro from - 400 base pair cdna templates .
"to address these concerns , improvements in the design and synthesis of next - gen rnai library reagents have been implemented including the elimination of sirnas with seed sequences that are complementary to microrna binding sites ( knott et al . , ; mohr & perrimon , ; petri & meister , ) .","as noted , the seed sequences of the nontargeting sirna sense strands have had their binding affinity decreased by selectively incorporating methylated or lna nucleotides ."
"additionally , candidate genes that score poorly in reagent redundancy validation assays , e . g . , only confirming the phenotype with one of four possible sirnas , are more likely to represent true positives if they physically or functionally interact with candidate genes that are members of enriched clusters .","consequently , bioinformatics can find useful associations that may save a potentially informative candidate gene from down selection ."
riger uses a weighted likelihood ratio to calculate a gene - specific enrichment score based on the rank distribution of each individual rnai reagent across all of those screened .,the riger enrichment score is eressed as a p value assigned to each gene which represents the likelihood that the gene plays a role in viral replication .
"collectively , morr / riger screening combined with gene eression filtering , and ote identification minimizes the caveats of rnai screening thus improving its efficiency and yield .",mrnas that are more often complementary to the validation round sirna seed sequences than the scrambled sequences are flagged as suspicious for being an ote and removed from further evaluation .
"haploid cell screens concerned with human - virus interactions have primarily been used in pooled screening approaches involving strong selective pressure by cytopathic viruses , either wild type or recombinant ( table ) .","kbm - 7 cells originated from a - year - old gentleman with chronic myelogenous leukemia ( cml ) and were first reported by the mccredie lab ( andersson et al . , ) , with later isolation of a clonal population of near - haploid cells ( 2 copies of chromosome and partial disomy of chromosome ) by kotecki , reddy , and cochran ."
"engineered cas9 proteins with improved specificity also promise to make false positives even rarer ( slaymaker et al . , ) .","several studies have found that while otes do occur using crispr / cas9 they appear to be less prevalent than the levels of otes encountered with rnai wang et al . , ; wu et al . , ) ."
"the egenously eressed cas9 can be either catalytically active and create null alleles , or a catalytically inactive protein fused to one of several transcription factor domains for activation or repression of the sgrna - targeted locus ( gilbert et al . , ; qi et al . , ) .","if transient eression is chosen then the cells must already eress the sgrna library ( shalem et al . , ; wang et al . , ) ."
"interestingly , the crispr / cas9 screen found that the emc complex , a conserved set of er - associated proteins implicated in transmembrane protein eression and lipid trafficking was required for wnv ' s cytopathic effect but not its replication ( wideman , ) .","not surprisingly the candidate gene overlap between the two efforts was small in part arising from the different endpoints , cell survival versus viral protein eression ."
"a single hrv - hf candidate , icam1 , shared between the arrayed morr / riger sirna screen and the matched pooled crispr / cas9 screen , is highlighted with a box .","the authors own all the figures included from published work ( perreira et al . , ) , under a creative commons license agreement with cell reports ."
"this last notion is supported by two independently performed arrayed sirna screens which respectively reported and high - confidence candidates necessary for vsv replication , many of which were involved in postentry phases of the viral lifecycle ; none of these candidates were found in the rvsv - based haploid cell screens .",interestingly one of the screens found that coatomer ( cop1 ) and the v - atpase were required for vsv replication .
"after selection , the group eanded the surviving cells and used their pooled genomic dna to identify independent integrations sites .","one billion hap1 cells were retrovirally mutagenized and screened for survival after infection with either rvsv - andv or a matched control virus , rvsv - g , which eressed the vsv - g receptor ."
"given the greater number of high - confidence candidates found in the rnai screen , it would be interesting to determine if they were also all acting at entry or were instead required for the early postentry replication and eression of the luciferase transgene within the rvsv genome .","therefore , as with the other haploid cell screen noted above , this approach excels at finding entry factors ."
an arrayed haploid cell or crispr / cas9 approach would permit more subtle selection criteria to be used such as those employed with arrayed sirna screens .,"with this in mind , recent efforts have resulted in clonal hap1 cell populations being characterized and arrayed with each one lacking the eression of a single gene due to retroviral insertion ( petersen et al . , ) ."
the identities of the enriched sgrnas were determined using pcr amplification of genomic dna followed by next - gen sequencing .,based on anti - tnf antibody - associated immunofluorescence both high and low eressing tnf populations were sorted using flow cytometry .
"while most current crispr / cas9 pooled screens lack sensitivity , they nonetheless appear to have fewer false positives than rnai screens , lowering the work load and increasing the efficiency of validation ( table ) .","in our hrv - hf crispr / cas9 screen , we detected a number of single sgrnas for multiple genes with the majority having < 6 reads ."
"to summarize , sirna screens using arrayed one - gene - per - well format with moderate selection criteria , e . g . , percent infected cells , permit the detection of a larger number of viral dependency factors , with the significant tradeoff being a greater number of false positives or otes .","in contrast , pooled screens using cell survival as a readout as seen with the majority of haploid cell , and likely with additional crispr / cas9 pooled screens to come , display limited sensitivity but excellent specificity in finding host genes that act very early in viral replication , for instance host factors needed for viral entry ( icam1 ) ( tables and ) ."
"pooled haploid cell screens also appear vulnerable to displacement by crispr / cas9 pooled approaches because of their dependence on only two transformed haploid cell lines , in conjunction with their more laborious identification of candidate genes .","what ' s more , based on the established preference of retroviral insertion it is improbable that haploid cell screens will approach the saturation or representation produced with crispr / cas9 methods ."
"however , candidates found in screens using such synthetic transcription factors will need to be confirmed with rescue eeriments given the questionable value of reagent redundancy approaches .",this concern arises because of the potential for shared long distance otes being produced by orthologous sgrnas designed against the same gene which will be binding relatively close to one another .
a questionnaire designed to gather information on calf - level management factors was administered on farm for each calf in the study .,"samples were examined for c . parvum oocysts by microscopy , and a subset of specimens was also tested for enterotoxigenic escherichia coli , salmonella , bovine rotavirus and bovine coronavirus ."
"calves shedding c . parvum oocysts had ( 95% ci , ) times the odds of diarrhea than non - shedding calves , controlling for other factors included in the final multivariable model .","furthermore , infected calves shedding more than oocysts per gram of feces were more likely to scour than infected calves shedding lower numbers of oocysts ( or = , % ci , ) ."
"mortality may occur in severely affected animals , but , more often , a self - limiting secretory diarrhea results in morbidity and increased labour and veterinary costs ( de graaf et al . , ) .","infected animals usually shed large numbers of infective oocysts in the feces ( nydam et al . , ) ."
"found that feeding milk replacer , use of antibiotics and use of fan or exhaust ventilation in calf rearing areas were all associated with a decreased risk of shedding on dairy farms in new york state , usa .","in a cross - sectional study conducted in mexico , use of hay bedding in the maternity area , sweeping the maternity area and feeding starter grain to dairy calves were identified as practices associated with increased shedding of c . parvum ( maldonado - camargo et al . , ) ."
this study was carried out with the objective of identifying potential calf - level risk factors for neonatal diarrhea and c . parvum shedding among pre - weaned dairy calves on purposively selected farms with histories of calf diarrhea or cryptosporidiosis in south - western ontario .,"moreover , it is unknown whether risk factors for c . parvum shedding and calf diarrhea identified by previous work done in ontario or elsewhere , are associated with the risk of infection and diarrhea on ontario dairy farms ."
this gave an estimated sample size of calves ( 495 per group ) .,"the estimated sample size ( 36 calves per group ) was adjusted for a cluster size of with an intra - herd correlation of , and for covariates with an estimated average correlation with infection of ."
"farms were recruited using purposive sampling , with the assistance of dairy practitioners in the area .",calves from to days of age on dairy farms in south - western ontario were sampled .
approximately g of fresh feces were collected per rectum in a clean screw - topped vial .,"a ml sample of blood was drawn from each newly enrolled calf by venepuncture : ml into a sterile vacutainer containing ethylene diamine tetra - acetic acid ( edta ) and ml into a vacutainer without anticoagulant ( becton dickinson , mississauga , ont . , canada ) ."
"serum was separated from each blood sample within h of collection , and was used to assess passive transfer of maternal immunity by total serum protein refractometry ( calloway et al . , ) as well as by using an automated serum analyzer ( hitachi ltd . , hitachinaka , japan ) .","blood and fecal samples were transported to the ovc in coolers , and were then refrigerated at c until processed ."
"using polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism of the cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein as a gold standard , this test showed a sensitivity of % ( 95% confidence interval ( ci ) %, %) and a specificity of % ( 95% ci %, %) when used on calf fecal specimens ( trotz - williams et al . , b ) .","briefly , g of feces was mixed with ml of sucrose solution of specific gravity 2 ."
"fecal samples from a specific subset of calves were tested at the university of guelph animal health laboratory ( ahl ) for infection with enterotoxigenic escherichia coli ( etec ) , salmonella spp . , bovine rotavirus ( brv ) group a and bovine coronavirus ( bcv ) .",calves were selected for these tests using the two - stage sampling procedure described by schaubel et al .
"an antigen detection elisa ( syracuse bioanalytical , syracuse , new york ) was employed for detection of bovine coronavirus .","testing for bovine rotavirus was carried out at the ahl using a latex agglutination test ( rotascreen , microgen bioproducts , surrey , uk ) ."
"examples of factors investigated were ease of birth , amount of time for which the calf had remained with its dam after birth , calving area hygiene , quantity and source of colostrum fed , preventive procedures performed on the neonatal calf such as vaccination and navel - dipping , and type of housing in which the calf was kept for the first weeks of life .",a copy of the questionnaire used for this study is available from the authors in english .
"similarly , the dependent variable used to represent the risk of diarrhea was the diarrheic or nondiarrheic status of individual fecal specimens , with specimens having consistency scores of or classified as diarrheic .",the intra - class correlation of c . parvum shedding was estimated using a one - way analysis of variance approach with the ' loneway ' command in stata .
variables that were significant at the % level in univariable screening were used to build multivariable multilevel generalized linear mixed models using the ' ' gllamm ' ' command in stata .,"as in univariable modelling , c . parvum shedding status , and diarrhea status of calves at individual weekly sampling times , were used as response variables in modelling risk of shedding and risk of diarrhea , respectively ."
this showed that differences significant at the % level existed between summer and winter born calves with reference to several management practices .,"to control for these differences , season of birth was forced into the multilevel models previously described ."
"where n , n , n , n , n , n , n and n refer to the numbers of calves in subsets of the first ( n ) and second ( n ) stage of the study population , respectively .",subsets were defined by c . parvum ( i ) and diarrhea ( j ) status .
reasons for this were similar to those stated for missing c . parvum data .,"of the remaining animals , ( 73% ) were diarrheic at the time of collection of at least one sample ."
table a shows the results of unconditional screening of predictor variables for association with c . parvum shedding .,the prevalence of bacterial and viral enteropathogens is summarized in table .
"no other confounders were identified , and there was no statistical evidence of interaction between variables in this model .","predicted probabilities , pearson and deviance residuals and cook ' s distance values indicated that this model fit the data moderately well ."
"nonetheless , the regression coefficient for the overall c . parvum shedding status of calves ( produced by the construction of a logistic model for diarrhea that included data on all of the enteropathogens obtained from the second - stage as fixed effects , as well as herd as a random effect ) was adjusted using the method previously described .","this may have been partly due to low power , as only % of the calves were tested for these agents ."
"in addition , calves in our study were all under month of age , and were therefore within the age group known to show the highest prevalence of c . parvum infection and diarrhea .","moreover , of the calves enrolled in this study , were from a single large herd with a high prevalence of c . parvum shedding ( 91% ) and diarrhea ( 79% ); the overall prevalence of c . parvum shedding on the other farms was %."
"as is often the case with predictors found to be significantly associated with a response variable in a statistical model , the associations observed in our study may not reflect actual causal or protective relationships .","instead , the predictors included in the model may merely be indicators of other unknown management factors that are directly related to the risk of c . parvum infection and shedding in calves ."
the low predicted probabilities of diarrhea in c . parvum negative calves ( fig .,"it appears , therefore , that c . parvum was the enteropathogen most strongly associated with diarrhea , as well as , perhaps , the most common cause of calf diarrhea , within our study population ."
"furthermore , the fact that the farms used in our study were selected based on a history of calf diarrhea or cryptosporidiosis may have contributed to some of the differences between the findings reported here and those of other researchers .","it is possible that the cases of diarrhea observed in the calves used in previous studies ( waltner - toews et al . , ; curtis et al . , ; frank and kaneene , ) were predominantly caused by enteropathogens other than c . parvum ."
"alternatively , other unknown and unmeasured factors that predisposed c . parvum - infected animals to the development of diarrhea may have been more prevalent in the warmer months of the year , either directly or indirectly because of seasonal conditions .","not surprisingly , among the c . parvumpositive calves , the odds of diarrhea in animals shedding more than oocysts per gram of feces were more than six times the odds in calves shedding fewer than oocysts per gram of feces ."
it should be noted that the lack of association in our study may not be reflective of the relationship between fpt and diarrhea in the wider population of dairy calves in the region .,"table multivariable generalized linear mixed model of diarrhea in calves - 30 days in south - western ontario shedding cryptosporidium parvum , regressed on management factors significant at the % level in univariable analysis"
"as mentioned previously , most of the variation in the risk of infection was between herds , as opposed to within herds .","in view of the fact that only purposively selected farms were used in the study , these variables were therefore less suitable for the identification of calf - level risk factors than the ' true ' calf - level variables ."
the results of this study show that c . parvum is common among calves under month of age in south - western ontario dairy herds eeriencing problems with calf diarrhea .,"in addition , the parasite appears to be a primary cause of diarrhea among calves under month of age group in the herds used in this study ."
the sensitivity rate was identical at % for all virus groups except coronaviruses .,this sensitivity rate clearly justifies the use of pooled samples instead of separate samples for clinical and epidemiological purposes .
"in a previous study , we assessed the preferred sampling technique for the identification of respiratory viruses in adults .",several methods have been developed over recent decades for the identification of viruses that cause respiratory viral infections .
"the study was approved by the helsinki committee for research on human beings of the soroka medical center , and all participants gave signed informed consent to participate .",the full inclusion and exclusion criteria for the patients and controls and the sampling methods in the present study were identical to those of the previous study and are detailed in the paper from that study .
"the raw nasopharyngeal washing matter was added to a test tube containing ml of rpmi solution , which was also vortexed .","then , ml from each of the three sample fluids were pooled together and vortexed in a separate test tube whose content represented the pooled sample ."
acute cellular rejection affects greater than a third of lung transplant recipients .,"alloreactive t lymphocytes , responding directly or indirectly to donor antigen , constitute the basis of lung allograft rejection , as diagnosed by well - established histopathological criteria that reflect the severity of perivascular or peribronchial inflammation in the lung allograft ."
"although acute lung rejection in itself is rarely fatal , its indirect consequences have considerable adverse effects on transplant outcomes .","acute allograft rejection remains a prevalent and serious problem in lung transplantation , with an incidence of % in the first year post transplant according to the latest report from the registry of the international society for heart and lung transplantation ( ishlt ) ."
"in addition , some lung transplant recipients appear to mount a humoral response to the allograft after transplantation .","most evidence suggests that this humoral response occurs to donor mhc antigens , although other endothelial or epithelial antigens eressed in the lung may become antibody targets as well ."
"because of the non - specific nature of symptoms and signs , emphasis should be placed on objective data , mainly pulmonary function testing , in identifying patients at risk for rejection .","spirometry has been found to have a sensitivity of greater than % for detecting infection or rejection grade a2 and higher , but it cannot differentiate between the two ."
a randomized trial would be helpful to determine the benefit of surveillance bronchoscopies in lung transplant recipients .,"disputing this approach , one group showed that - year outcomes in patients who underwent only clinically - indicated bronchoscopies were comparable to those that underwent surveillance bronchoscopies as well as to the ishlt database outcomes ."
"in an attempt to obviate the need for surveillance biopsies , many reports have focused on less invasive surrogates of acute lung rejection .",multiple studies have assessed bal cells and proteins as possible correlates of acute rejection but many of these studies were small and have not been replicated .
"although no effective serum biomarkers are currently in use in clinical lung transplant , many have been studied and some , such as the hepatocyte growth factor have been shown to correlate with acute rejection in small single - center studies .",even more attractive are studies of non - invasive means of diagnosing acute rejection without bronchoscopy .
"the histological appearance of acute lung allograft rejection and the grading rules for acute cellular rejection ( a - grade ) , airway inflammation ( b - grade ) , chronic airway rejection or bronchiolitis obliterans ( c - grade ) , and chronic vascular rejection or accelerated graft vascular sclerosis ( d - grade ) are outlined in the working formulation published by the lung rejection study group ( lrsg ) through a workshop organized by the ishlt .",the grading scheme and its key features are summarized in table and illustrative images from our institution are shown in figure .
"confounding features , such as concurrent infection or alveolar damage early post transplant , may additionally blur the picture and contribute to the interreader pathologist discordance .","in general , the lrsg recommends grading rejection only after the exclusion of infection ."
"the b - grade airway mononuclear inflammation is clearly part of the spectrum of acute cellular rejection ( figure e & f ) but grading remains inconsistent due to frequent lack of airway tissue on biopsies , susceptibility to tissue artifacts , and confounding by concurrent infections .","due to low inter reader reliability of the prior - grade ( 0 to ) grading schema for b - grade rejection , , the lrsg has simplified the b - grading to grades ( 0 to ) ( table ) ."
"studies have since found that minimal acute rejection ( grade a1 ) increases the risk of subsequent higher - grade rejections ( grade a2 ) , and of subsequent bos and that an untreated solitary perivascular monocytic infiltrate may lead to worsening acute rejection .","in the early years of lung transplantation , a1 rejection was usually discounted and not treated ."
"consistent with this idea , several singlecenter studies have shown that an increasing degree of hla mismatch , especially at the hla - dr , hla - b , and hla - a loci , increases the risk of acute rejection .","additionally , the ishlt registry data show a correlation between hla matching as well as gendermatching and - year survival ."
"consistent with this paradigm , gastroesophageal reflux disease has also been associated with increased rates of acute rejection .","furthermore , as discussed below , rejection has also been appreciated following a number of respiratory infections ."
"however , more studies are needed to determine the true effect of age on rejection before a strategy of reduced immunosuppression can be advocated in older recipients .","the incidence of acute rejection in older lung transplant recipients ( age or higher ) appears to be similar to that of younger adults , while their rate of infections appears higher , potentially contributing to increased mortality ."
studies directly linking cmv infection or cmv prophylaxis strategies with acute rejection have been inconsistent and a recent randomized trial of cmv prophylaxis did not identify a correlation between cmv incidence and acute rejection rates .,studies on the role of other herpesviruses and polyomaviruses are being conducted with no evidence of association with acute rejection to date .
"a recent report demonstrated the utility of alemtuzumab , an anti - cd52 monoclonal antibody , in the treatment of refractory acute rejection in a small cohort of patients who previously failed treatment with atg .","other therapies that have been considered include inhaled cyclosporine , , extracorporeal photopheresis , and total lymphoid irradiation ."
"early observations were based on the phenomenon of hyperacute rejection , where pre - existent donor - specific antibodies lead to complement activation and rapid graft loss .","with the advent of improved crossmatching pre transplant , the incidence of hyperacute rejection in all organs has decreased ."
the mechanisms by which antibody promotes lung allograft injury remain poorly understood .,"antibody binding to allo - mhc or other endothelial or epithelial targets in the lung could lead to activation of the complement cascade with complement deposits leading to endothelial cell injury , production of pro - inflammatory and fibroblast - stimulating molecules , recruitment of inflammatory cells , as well as increased gene eression and subsequent proliferation , , potentially contributing to the generation of obliterative airway lesions ."
"the original methodology for hla serologic typing , antibody screening and identification , and direct crossmatching was the complement dependent cytotoxicity ( cdc ) assay .","the assay is based on the specific reactivity between serum antibody and cell surface antigen that activates complement , causing cell death , which can be identified under the microscope using vital dyes for cell staining ."
the cdc assay has now been replaced at most institutions with the more sensitive and specific solid - phase technologies that use a solid matrix coated with purified hla antigens obtained from either cell lines or recombinant technology .,these assays have the ability to detect both complement - fixing antibodies and non - complement - fixing antibodies .
"flow crossmatch , whereby actual donor cells are incubated with recipient serum and bound antibodies are then tagged with secondary fluorescent anti - igg antibodies , has been proven to be up to to times more sensitive than a cdc crossmatch .","nevertheless , the most definitive compatibility test remains the real - time crossmatch of the recipient serum with the potential donor cells ."
"this virtual crossmatch approach has significantly shortened the waiting time for presensitized recipients , and correlates highly with crossmatch results performed at the time of transplant .","when a donor becomes available , information about the donor hla antigens and the recipient antibodies is compared , constituting a "" virtual crossmatch "" and allowing for the real - time prospective crossmatch to be waived ."
it remains unclear exactly how often post transplant pras should be measured and to what extent humoral rejection occurs among lung transplant recipients .,"additional research is needed to more precisely define the significance of antibody to donor hla , to third party hla , or to self - antigens after lung transplantation ."
"hyperacute rejection usually occurs within hours of transplantation and manifests with acute pulmonary decompensation , profound hypoxemia , diffuse pulmonary edema and alveolar hemorrhage .","although uncommon due to the use of crossmatch screening , hyperacute rejection , caused by pre - existing recipient antibodies against donor hla antigens , has been described ."
the consensus is that capillary injury can be detected on lung allograft biopsies ( figure g ) although it can be a nonspecific finding .,the lrsg report on the working formulation for the diagnosis of lung rejection remains very cautious in defining the pathologic appearance of humoral rejection .
"despite new highly sensitive measures to screen for anti - hla antibodies and evidence that such antibodies are detrimental to the allograft , optimal monitoring , treatment parameters for humoral rejection , and the benefits of preemptive strategies to deplete these antibodies remain uncertain .",its use in lung transplantation has been described in one case report .
"after incubation with patient serum , and subsequent staining with fitc - labeled anti - human igg , flowpra beads were analyzed on a flow cytometer .",flow cytometric antibody screening for measurement of panel reactive antibody ( pra ) : flowpra beads are coated with purified hla antigens .
"a total of clinical serum samples were tested with the elisa kit , which positively identified of ( 71.4% ) samples of patients with confirmed sars infection , of ( 70% ) samples of patients suspected of having sars , of ( 75.8% ) samples of convalescent sars patients , and of samples obtained from healthcare workers ; only of clinical samples obtained from patients with other diseases demonstrated a weakly positive result .",these results indicate that the double - antigen sandwich elisa is an effective screening method for the serodiagnosis of sars - associated coronavirus .
"coronaviruses are a family of enveloped single positivestranded rna viruses that cause disease in humans and animals , but the other coronaviruses that are known to affect humans cause only the common cold .","determination of the complete genome sequence of sars - cov identified the cause of the new disease , and bioinformatic analyses and sequence comparisons showed that sars - cov is not closely related to any of the other previously characterized coronaviruses , demonstrating an approximate identity of only % with other known coronaviruses ."
"previous research showed it has a variety of functions , including participation in the transcription and replication of viral rna , and interference with cell cycle processes of host cells .",the nucleocapsid protein is one of the major structural proteins of the virus .
forward primer nf1 ( 5 - gcggatccagcggaggtggtgaaactgcc - 3 ) ( the underlined sequence represents the bamhi site ) and reverse primer nr1 ( 5 - ccgaattcttatgcctgagtt gaatc - 3 ) ( the underlined sequence represents the ecori site ) were designed to amplify this gene .,"total rna of sars - cov was kindly provided by the zhejiang province branch of the centers for disease control and prevention , and the thermoscript rt - pcr system ( invitrogen , san diego , ca , usa ) was used to obtain nucleocapsid gene according to the manufacturer ' s instructions ."
"the recombinant clones were identified by pcr and confirmed by sequencing , and the right recombinant plasmid was transformed into bl21 ( de3 ; novagen , madison , wi , usa ) for eression of the nucleocapsid protein .",a freshly isolated colony was chosen and incubated overnight at c in liquid luria - bertani medium containing ampicillin ( 100 g / ml ) .
"after transfer , the polyvinylidene diflouride membrane ( sigma , st . louis , mo , usa ) was blocked in blocking buffer , phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) supplemented with % dry skimmed milk ( pbsm ) , for min at room temperature .","after blocking , the membrane was incubated with antiserum from mouse vaccinated with the inactivated sars coronavirus diluted : 100 in pbsm for h . a negative control was also set to incubate with serum from a healthy individual ."
"for the removal of unconjugated hrp , the conjugated solution was subjected to a sephadex g200 column ( amersham pharmacia biotech ) .","the binding capacity ( i . e . , the mole rate of hrp to antigen ) of the hrp - conjugated antigen was analyzed using calculated od405 / od280 values , and the valence of the hrp - conjugated antigen was determined by checkerboard titration ."
"after overnight incubation at c , the wells were washed three times with pbs containing 5% tween20 and blocked with l of 5% bovine serum albumin dissolved in 1 mol / l pbs ( ph ) for h at c . the wells were again washed three times with pbs containing 5% tween20 and dried at room temperature for h . for sample detection , l sera and l hrp - conjugated antigen were added to each well .",a negative and a positive control was included on each plate .
"- pcr was performed in a - l volume of a final mixture containing l of rna , mm of tris - hcl ( ph .",real - time ( rt ) - pcr to detect sars - cov was performed as described previously .
the purified pcr products were digested with bamhi and ecori and cloned into pgex - 4 t - 1 in order to obtain a glutathione - s - transferase ( gst ) fusion protein .,"as analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis , the partial nucleocapsid gene product with the eected size was obtained ."
"the eressed nucleocapsid fusion proteins each had an approximate molecular mass of kda , in accordance with the eected size of the fusion proteins , and they were highly eressed in e . coli , with the amount of the fusion protein being about % of the total protein of the cell lysates .","when the fusion proteins are purified with glutathione - sepharose b , the purity of the recombinant nucleocapsid protein can reach %."
"the p value was calculated as 21 using student ' s t - test , which showed that the binding capacity of gst - n - 4 k - hrp conjugate was better .","the valence of gst - n - hrp and gst - n - 4 k - hrp , as determined by checkerboard titration , was : 500 ( about g / ml ) and : 1000 ( about g / ml ) , respectively ."
combinations that gave the highest p / n ratios ( od positive control / od negative control ) were determined as optimal .,the results showed that ng / well of antigen combined with : 1000 diluted conjugate gave the highest p / n ratio of 7 5 .
"the mean od ( and standard deviation ( sd ) values were calculated as 50 and 333 , respectively .","to determine the optimal od cutoff value for the elisa assay to allow discrimination between samples positive and negative for sars , human sera from healthy individuals were tested with the elisa ( data not shown ) ."
"to investigate the specificity and sensitivity of the elisa assay , a panel set up by the national institute for the control of pharmaceutical and biological products in beijing , china , was employed ; it included positive sera , negative sera , and serially diluted serum as a sensitivity control ( which tested positive at a maximum dilution of : 4 , as assayed by immunofluorescent and indirect elisa with virus lysates as antigen ) .","each of the positive sera produced an od between 54 and 98 , all of which were greater than the cutoff point , and all negative sera gave an od below 5 ( 0.058 30 ) ."
repeatability of the sandwich elisa for intra - and interassay precision was assessed using positive qualitycontrol sera .,"the coefficient of variation range was - 4.1% for intra - assay precision and - 4.4% for inter - assay precision , indicating the elisa is a specific , sensitive , and repeatable method ."
"however , the eight cases we knew were excluded and were placed in a separate group , and the elisa produced negative results for all of these patients .","unfortunately , it was not possible for us to follow up all of those patients and their samples , which were collected at various times during the outbreak ; thus , we are not sure how many patients in this group were eventually excluded ."
"the world health organization has reported that tests to detect sars - cov might be positive as early as - 10 days after the onset of illness and often by day , but sometimes a positive result is not achieved until days after illness onset .","for the cases we tested , samples were collected from patients who had been ill for less than days , and only of these were weakly positive , whereas all of the samples from patients who had been ill for more than days were positive ."
"for the five sera collected more than days after illness onset , the elisa detected all five samples , while the real - time pcr detected only two .","as for sera collected during the middle stage of illness ( i . e . , - 25 days after illness onset ) , the two assays gave similar results of about %."
"in this trial , the percentage of cases detected by real - time pcr was unsatisfactory , even for samples obtained during the early stage of illness .",our results indicate a combination of rt - pcr and elisa would be the most effective means of detecting the sars pathogen .
"management is largely supportive , and is focused on protective mechanical ventilation and the avoidance of fl uid overload .","patients with severe hypoxaemia can be managed with early short - term use of neuromuscular blockade , prone position ventilation , or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ."
"this syndrome presents as acute hypoxaemia with bilateral pulmonary infi ltrates on chest imaging , which are not wholly due to heart failure .","acute respiratory distress syndrome is a form of noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema , due to alveolar injury secondary to an infl ammatory process , that can be either pulmonary or systemic in origin ."
"the lungsafe study showed that the syndrome remains common and has a mortality of approximately %, and emphasised the global burden .","a further - 20% of patients will die by months , largely because of comorbidities rather than residual eff ects of acute respiratory distress syndrome ."
"these processes also drive excessive systemic infl ammation , with the ability to induce non - pulmonary organ failure ( biotrauma ) .","in a randomised controlled trial of critically ill mechanically ventilated patients , ventilation with ml rather than ml per kg of predicted bodyweight was associated with a fi ve - times increase in the odds of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome ."
the loss of epithelial ion channels impairs the generation of osmotic forces required to return oedema fl uid to the interstitium .,"the infl ammatory exudate produced physically interacts with surfactant , initially causing dysfunction followed by , as the epithelial injury progresses , loss of surfactant production , which impedes alveolar patency ."
"diff use alveolar damage is thought to be the pathognomonic pathological fi nding of acute respiratory distress syndrome , is defi ned by the presence of hyaline membranes , and can be detected either by lung biopsy or at autopsy .","the third fi brotic phase develops inconsistently , and comprises failure of removal of alveolar collagen , which is laid down early in the injury process , combined with the development of cystic changes , limiting functional recovery ."
"biomarkers have been measured in both blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid , but are too inaccurate for clinical use .","many candidate biomarkers ( fi gure ) have been investigated , but a single , clear biomarker has proved diffi cult to fi nd ."
management of acute respiratory distress syndrome can be classed as specifi c or supportive ; addressing the underlying causative condition is also necessary ( fi gure ) .,specifi c measures include both maintenance of gas exchange and manipulation of the underlying pathophysiology .
"benefi cial eff ects include the maintenance of functional residual capacity , improved compliance , and higher mean airway pressure , which result in decreased shunt with enhanced oxygenation , and reduced atelectasis and biotrauma .",peep prevents lung unit collapse at the end of the respiratory cycle .
driving pressure could help to calibrate the mechanical stress delivered by the ventilator to the functional aerated lung volume .,"although ml / kg tidal volume is recognised as low - tidal - volume ventilation , it is the normal tidal volume of most mammalian species ."
"a systematic review , based on studies , showed that recruitment manoeuvres increased oxygenation , but little information about the long - term eff ects of these interventions and no clear guidance on the usefulness of this procedure was available .",preclinical data have shown divergent eff ects of recruitment manoeuvres on alveolar epithelial and endothelial function .
"the advent of high - fl ow nasal oxygen allows for simpler , more tolerable respiratory support .","in an observational study , ( 40% ) of patients with moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome ( mean pao / fio mm hg ) treated with high - fl ow nasal oxygen required invasive mechanical ventilation ."
"there were no additional complications associated with prone positioning , although the centres involved were all eerienced with this technique .","this magnitude of eff ect , although large , was predicted by a previous meta - analysis ."
"in the accursy study , cisatracurium - besylate - induced paralysis was compared with placebo in patients with early severe acute respiratory distress syndrome .","neuromuscular blockade for h resulted in - after adjustment for baseline pao / fio , plateau pressure , and simplifi ed acute physiology ii scores - a reduced adjusted hr for death at days ( 0 , % ci - 0 ; p =0 ) ."
"at present , the evidence base for these interventions is sparse , consisting of case series , observational cohort studies , and one randomised controlled trial .","in addition to replacing endogenous alveolar gaseous exchange , extracorporeal gas exchange - either extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ecmo ) or extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal - allows reduction in ventilatory settings , reducing the risk of ventilator - induced lung injury ."
"this mode of ventilation also aff ords separation of oxygenation , which is dependent on fio and mean airway pressure , from carbon dioxide removal , which is an active process that depends on the pressure amplitude and frequency of oscillation .","two large randomised controlled trials , from canada ( oscillate ) and the uk ( oscar ) , failed to show benefi t from this mode of ventilation ."
"in addition to their cholesterollowering eff ects , statins have pleotropic properties , making them an attractive potential therapy .","in the irish critical care trials group ' s harp - 2 study , preclinical data suggest that agonists could modify several pulmonary mechanisms ."
fluid excess is increasingly linked to detrimental outcomes across the spectrum of critical illnesses .,"a general paradigm exists of early fl uid loading for resuscitation and organ rescue during thrombosis key the presentation stage of the illness , followed by fl uid unloading ( deresuscitation ) - either spontaneous or induced - after haemodynamic stability has been achieved ."
"despite an eight - times increase in plasma n - 3 fatty acid concentrations in the intervention group , there were clear signals of harm necessitating the termination of the study , including decreased ventilatorfree , non - pulmonary - organ - failure - free , and icu - free days , and a non - signifi cant increase in mortality .",a subsequent small phase study of fi sh oils in patients again failed to demonstrate benefi t in this population .
"in general , patients should be lightly sedated , with emphasis on analgesia , and benzodiazepines should be avoided when possible .","early deep sedation in mechanically ventilated patients is associated with increased mortality ; by contrast , early mobilisation has been associated with improved outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure ."
"there are many reasons for this failure , but arguably the most important is the limitation of the current defi nitions of acute respiratory distress syndrome in terms of the identifi cation of patients eressing the biological target under investigation .","in approximately half of patients who meet diagnostic criteria and subsequently undergo post - mortem examination , the pathognomonic fi nding of diff use alveolar damage is not present ."
this issue raises the question as to whether the unsuccessful therapeutic trials reported would have had the same results had it been possible to identify specifi c phenotypes responsive to the therapy under investigation .,"constructing a trial in which % of the study population does not have the biological target under investigation is problematic and has clear implications for the evidence base for acute respiratory distress syndrome , which has been largely reliant on the american european consensus conference and berlin defi nitions ."
"in current study , we found rgd / kgd motif presents not only in s protein but also in its receptor ace2 .",a recent study proposed a proviral role for integrins in sars - cov - 2 entry .
an rgd motif was identified in sars - cov - 2 s protein ( figure a ) .,"first , we performed sequence analysis of s proteins from sars - cov - 2 ( yp_009724390 . 1 ) and sars - cov ( np_828851 . 1 ) ."
"next , we checked the structure of ace2 with sars - cov - 2 s rbd ( pdb : lzg ) and ace2 with sars - cov s rbd ( pdb : ajf ) by chimera software ver 4 .",rgd / kgd in s protein is near the groove of complex of rbd and ace2 ( figure d and e ) .
"we identified a kgd motif in - 355 of ace2 ( bab40370 . 1 ) , which is a key region for binding s protein ( figure f ) .","this kgd motif is on the eed small loop in the structure of open ace2 dimer ( pdb : m1d ) and closed ace2 dimer ( pdb : m18 ) , which indicated that integrin could interact with ace2 through this motif ( figure g ) ."
"upon sars - cov - 2 or sars - cov infection , integrin could interact with ace2 and s protein individually .","integrin associates with ace2 through its kgd motif including k353 , which is one of key aas for s protein recognition ."
"when integrins bind to s protein , ace2 targeting by s protein will also be inhibited .","taken together , our model favors an inhibitory role for integrins in virus entry by associating with both s protein and ace2 ."
potential association of s protein and integrins provide mechanistic insights for the pathogenesis of sars - cov - 2 and sars - cov .,"because rgd recognized a broader spectrum of integrins than kgd , more integrins could block receptor binding of sars - cov - 2 s than that of sars - cov s . consequently , sars - cov - 2 would infect fewer organs than sars - cov , which might partially elain why sars - cov - 2 caused less mortality than sars - cov ."
glycosylation of these flavonols with various glycosyl donors affords a library of glycosylated flavonols .,a library of flavonols has been made through algar - flynn - oyamada reaction from - hydroxyacetophenones and benzaldehydes .
"many flavonol natural products are glycosylated , like compounds in figure .","the sugar part can be almost any common sugars , such as glucose , galactose , rhamnose , fucose , xylose or arabinose ."
"so equiv of flavonol was treated with equiv of peracetylglycosyl bromide , equiv of tbab ( tetrabutylammonium bromide ) , and equiv of potassium carbonate in : 1 ( chloroform / water ) at c for h . this method can give glycosylated product at around % yield , however , the product is often difficult to be separated from a side product of the reaction , the lactols formed from hydrolysis of glycosyl bromides through flash chromatography .","to solve this problem , the crude product was further treated with acetic anhydride and triethylamine at room temperature ."
"in the present study , we aimed to evaluate the immune responses of peptide - specific c + t cells induced by hla - a*0201 restricted severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated coronavirus ( sars - cov ) s epitopes plus cpg oligodeoxynucleotide ( cpg odn ) , polyi and r848 as adjuvants .","furthermore , the generation , distribution and phenotype of long - lasting peptide - specific memory c + t cells were assessed by elisa , elispot and flow cytometry ."
"furthermore , some evidence proved that the humoral immune responses in sars recovered patients decreased in a time - dependent manner , and our previous results showed that cellular immune responses attenuated in recovered individuals .","to date , there is no effective drug to prevent or treat sars ."
"recently , epitope vaccines which mainly contain the protective epitopes without pathological peptides have been considered as alterna - abbreviations : sars , severe acute respiratory syndrome ; sars - cov , sarsassociated coronavirus ; cpg odn , cpg oligodeoxynucleotides ; tlr , toll - like receptor .","as all know , vaccines are the most economic and effective strategies to protect bodies against infectious diseases ."
"our previous data has demonstrated the additive effects of cpg oligodeoxynucleotide ( cpg odn ) , r848 and pika as adjuvants on augmenting immune responses to hbsag vaccination .","cpg , polyi and r848 which are ligands for tlr9 , tlr3 and tlr7 respectively can activate antigen - presenting cells and lead to t cell priming and acquired immunity ."

"lymph nodes ( popliteal fossa , groin and mesentery ) , spleens and lungs from individual mouse were harvested - 10 d or month after the boost vaccination .",single - cell suspensions were prepared and plated in triplicate in - well round bottom plates at cells / 200 l per well .
"after washing , wells were incubated with streptavidin conjugated horseradish peroxidase for h at room temperature .",wells were washed and incubated with biotinylated labeled anti - mouse ifn - antibody for h at room temperature .
"cells were washed , fixed with % paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in pbs buffer containing % saponin ( sigma ) , % bsa and 5% nan overnight at c . then cells were stained with conjugated mabs for surface markers ( cd4 , c , cd62l , cd107a / b and cd45rb ) and intracellular cytokine ifn - for min at c in dark .","brefeldin a ( 10 g / ml , sigma ) was added in the last h incubation ."
statistical evaluation of differences between means of eerimental groups was performed by analysis of variance and a non - parametric two - tailed t - test .,a value of p < 5 was considered to be significant .
hla - a*0201 tg mice were vaccinated with different agents in a similar manner as described in the materials and methods .,"fresh isolated lymphocytes from spleens , lymph nodes and lungs were cultured with g / ml cognate peptides plus g / ml anti - cd28 and in medium alone as controls ."
"as we all know , antigen - specific memory c + t cells played very important roles in clearing virus , which could be induced in vivo in a fast and specific manner .","in the above eeriments , we evaluated the peptide - specific ctls immune responses - 10 d after prime and boost vaccination ."
these data provided credible evidence for the direct application of epitopes to sars vaccine design .,"interestingly , we found that antigen specific c + t cells were elicited by hla - a*0201 restricted sars - cov s epitopes which might possess stable chemical and physical properties in vivo and that with memory phenotype could exist for a long time at the absence of cognate peptides ."
"the molecular mechanism underlying adjuvant activity has been poorly understood for a long time , but this field has been rapidly evolving since the discovery of the tlr family of proteins and their corresponding innate ligands .",an adjuvant which is usually used to enhance the immunogenicity of a vaccine will be required to promote not only humoral immune responses but also cellular immune responses .
"because human blood contains at least two distinct dc types , the cd11c + dc and the plasmacytoid dc , as well as the monocyte precursors of mo - dc .","if the present results are also the case in human , it is possible that use of cpg odn with sars epitope vaccine in human would prove superior to polyi and r848 ."
there is evidence supported by previous findings that the presence of cpg odn during c + t cell eansion lead to increased cd56 eression which is reported to be associated with cytolytic activity of peptide - specific c + t cells .,it suggests that cpg odn maybe not only increase the frequency of peptide - specific c + t cells but also affect their phenotype .
it suggests that they can not only augment cellular immune responses but also have remarkable effects on enhancing the humoral immune responses .,the efficacy of these adjuvants inducing humoral immune responses in sars s vaccine is also very important and undoubtedly should be paid more attention in the ongoing research plans .
"therefore , these results provide some novel information for the vaccine design and ongoing clinical trials will provide further insight into the activity of cpg odn as immune adjuvant for epitope vaccine against sars .",vaccinations with adjuvants that mimic tlr ligands are advantageous as they are capable of eliciting positive effects across the entire spectrum of innate and adaptive immunity .
this chapter reviews micro fl uidics in molecular diagnostics based on application areas with a concise review of micro fl uidics in general .,basic principles of microfabrication are brie fl y reviewed and the transition to polymer fabricated devices is discussed .
"recent pandemics like the h1n1 in fl uenza a pandemic , have accentuated the need for tools to effectively detect and control infectious diseases .","factors like "" rapid pathogen mutation rates , transformation of nonhuman pathogens into human pathogens , and recombination of nonhuman pathogen with human pathogens "" have added to the challenge of managing novel infectious diseases ."
"produces results that are easy to determine , such as "" positive "" or "" negative , "" a direct readout of numerical values , the clear presence or absence of a line , or obvious color gradations has test performance comparable to a traceable reference method , as demonstrated by studies in which intended operators perform the test ?",( intended operator refers to a test operator with limited or no training or hands - on eerience in conducting laboratory testing )
mobility has aided the rapid spread of infectious diseases from region of origin to other parts of the world as seen during the h1n1 pandemic .,"this mobility has highlighted the need for rapid , portable diagnostic ( point - of - care [ poc ] ) devices at ports of entry to prevent global spread of infections ."
"ischemic heart diseases and cerebrovascular diseases , which are the major causes of mortality in the developed world , can be targeted by effective diagnostics .","in the developed world , the strategy to deal with major disease burdens such as cancer is shifting from a therapeutic to diagnostic mode , as the cost of treating disease falls dramatically if it is found early ."
homeland security is another key sector where portable molecular biology tools are needed to detect a variety of biological agents .,"the us departments of health and human services ( hhs ) and agriculture ( usda ) maintains a list of biological agents and toxins de fi ned as select agents "" that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public , animal or plant health , or to animal or plant products "" ."
"hence , there is an unmet need for simple , low - cost / cost - effective , accurate , portable / point - of - care diagnostic tools for rapid identi fi cation of disease markers and pathogens in a variety of settings .","the fda ( food & drug administration ) , de fi nition of a "" simple test "" provides a benchmark for features for an ideal diagnostic tool ( table , ) ."
"micro fl uidics can be de fi ned as "" science and technology of systems that process or manipulate small ( 10 to liters ) amounts of fl uids , using channels with dimensions of tens to hundreds of micrometers "" .","lab - on - achip ( loc ) refers to the application of micro fl uidics in chemical , biological analysis and diagnostics ."
the high speed analysis also makes micro fl uidics a suitable candidate for highthroughput applications .,"the availability of fabrication methods to manufacture small smaller length scales result in faster analyses and higher sepa - ration ef fi ciencies , reducing response times ."
pervasive diagnostics should greatly increase the likelihood of personalized medicine having a signi fi cant impact on society .,"portability and a small footprint should allow fi eld and clinic use , as well as possibly allowing more widespread diagnostics ."
figure is an example of a real nucleotide analysis system developed at the state of utah center of excellence for biomedical micro fl uidics .,"the fi gure shows some of the various technologies that might be involved in sample preparation , analysis or separation , and detection ."
"a major driver for micro fl uidic development was the focus on genomics and the micro fl uidic system consists of fi ve different components : ( i ) a disposable micro fl uidic cartridge containing a glass fi ber fi lter ( inset fi gure ) ; ( ii ) a pdms - micro fl uidic chip for fl ow control ; ( iii ) micro fl uidic chambers for mixing , metering , pumping , and reactions ; ( iv ) a pneumatic micropump to deliver the eluted sample to downstream assays ; and ( v ) a vacuum pump to control the on - chip valves .","micro fl uidic devices have been steadily developing over the past years , but most of the progress related to diagnostic applications has been made in about the past years ."
microchip - based capillary electrophoresis ( ce ) for separation and relative quantitation of human serum proteins was achieved .,"presented an automated enzyme assay in which nanoliter volumes of substrate , enzyme , and inhibitor were mixed using electrokinetic fl ow ."
"in the s , to counter the threat of biological and chemical weapons , the us defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) supported development of "" fi eld - deployable micro fl uidic "" devices and was a driver for academic research in micro fl uidics .","the fi rst lab - on - a - chip emerged with the concept of a "" miniaturized total analysis system "" or tas , involving a silicon chip analyzer with sampling , sample pretreatment , separation , and detection functionalities embedded on an integrated system ."
"these include , "" reactor chambers for continuous precolumn and postcolumn labeling reactions "" , high speed ef fi cient separations , on - chip static mixing , separation of oligonucleotides , dna , and amino acids , and cell manipulation by electrical fi elds .",a host of innovations in micro fl uidic devices came forth in the period from to .
"most of the eloratory research in micro fl uidics is currently performed on polymer - based devices primarily made of poly ( dimethylsiloxane ) ( pdms ) , a soft elastomer .",soft lithography techniques for micro fl uidic devices have been reviewed multiple times along with many of the structures and devices than can be produced .
"packaging and other post processing steps like reagent introduction have also proven challenging and eensive , and consequently other manufacturing methods currently appear to be more in favor .","thus , while most of the earliest work in micro fl uidics was in silicon , the majority of current devices are now made in glass or a variety of plastics ."
"depending on the type of energy beam used , these can be divided into : photolithography , electron beam lithography , x - ray lithography , and ion lithography .",photolithography involves using light to transfer a geometric pattern from a photo mask to a light sensitive chemical
"sputtering , ion beam milling and plasma etching ( reactive ion etching and deep reactive ion etching ) are some of other methods used in silicon etching .",dry etching refers to the removal of material by bombarding it with ions .
"methods to deposit thin fi lms include : thermal oxidation of silicon , chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) , and physical vapor deposition ( pvd ) .",methods to deposit thick fi lms usually involve a spinning or electroplating technique .
"third , silicon is not transparent , so troubleshooting micro fl uidic devices during development can be dif fi cult and optical detection techniques cannot be employed .","second , the electronic advantages of silicon are not typically required in micro fl uidic devices ."
"polymers , due to their lower cost , ease of fabrication and physical properties , are now the primary materials used in micro fl uidic research .","many micro fl uidic components , such as pumps and valves , work better when fabricated in the less rigid polymer medium as compared with silicon ."
"although the technology is very promising , more work needs to be done to bring forth real world pad applications .","recently , micro fl uidic devices fabricated on engineered plastics , such as cyclo - ole fi n copolymers ( coc ) , and photocurable per fl uoropolyether ( pfpe ) have been reported ."
"a major boom in micro fl uidics research has occurred in the last - 12 years as is re fl ected by the number of published journal papers using the term : papers were published before , in the s , in the s and , 322 in the fi rst years of this decade .","while the number of papers each year appears to be leveling off , the impact of micro fl uidics is likely to continue to"
"interestingly , the two problems tend to converge towards one solution : micro fl uidic diagnostic devices .","in developing countries , delivery of medical services to remote and resource poor areas is dif fi cult and the needs are enormous , as infectious disease is a critical barrier to economic and social development ."
"the h1n1 in fl uenza pandemic had a total of , 677 reported cases in the usa as of july .",estimates of unreported cases are a much higher fi gure at - 5.7 million cases .
"thus , the driver for micro fl uidic diagnostics in developed countries is the need for consistent , accurate , and affordable diagnostics for chronic disease .",global mortality and disease burden projections suggest that these chronic conditions common to highincome countries will also become a priority for low - income countries by the year .
"under favorable temperature and in the presence of moisture and nutrition , bacteria spread rapidly .",for a list of bacterial diseases and corresponding causative agents the reader can refer to a review by ivnitski et al .
hence conventional methods take - 24 h at a minimum .,"also , conventional methods require complex equipment , highly trained technicians , and cannot be fi eld deployable or used in point - of - care settings ."
there are primarily two modes of pathogen detection : immunosensing and nucleic acid - based detection .,"in immunosensing , a binding interaction between probing antibodies and antigens of"
nucleic acid - based sensors detect dna or rna targets from the analyte organisms .,the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) or reverse transcription pcr ( rt - pcr ) is used to amplify the nucleic acids to enhance the detection signal .
a variety of micro fl uidic devices have been developed for bacteria using optical means .,optical detection methods are often preferred due to their high selectivity and sensitivity .
"many deadly viruses such as variola virus ( small po , rift valley fever virus , and venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus have been known to be developed as potential biological agents .",poc devices to detect these bio - agents are extremely critical for global biosecurity .
serologic tests detect the presence of antibodies that the immune system produces in response to viral infection .,"the primary methods for virus detection are serology , viral antigen detection , and nucleic acid detection ."
the number of cd4 + t - lymphocytes per microliter of hiv - infected blood is a critical monitor of disease state and this measurement is needed to make informed antiretroviral therapy ( art ) treatment decisions .,"thus , a simple , ineensive diagnostic tool for hiv would be readily welcomed ."
the in fl uenza virus causes respiratory tract infection and is found to be severely morbid in children and the elderly .,the challenge with diseases like in fl uenza is that there is a large variety of the viruses and they are constantly changing .
"some of the conventional diagnostic methods for in fl uenza virus are enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( elisa ) , immuno fl uorescence assays , serological hemagglutination inhibition assays , real - time polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) assays , and complement fi xation tests .","most of these methods are complicated , relatively costly and require a lengthy process and eensive apparatus ."
"the cancer mortality rate per , 000 americans has dropped from to since , an insigni fi cant drop compared to drop in mortality rates for other diseases .","by , cancer related deaths are estimated to be million globally ."
other techniques like immunoassays ( elisa ) have been used to detect cancer biomarkers .,"although elisas are very sensitive , they can be time consuming , eensive and are mostly carried out in a laboratory requiring skilled personnel ."
"although research into cancer diagnostic devices is moving forward , commercialization of the technology still remains a challenge .",hence poc devices with multiplexed capability to detect multiple biomarkers are needed .
reported work into the design and development of a micro fl uidic device for diagnosis of t - cell lymphoma .,"the system accepts a whole blood sample as the input , extracts the dna , ampli fi es target sequences of the t - cell receptor - gene , and eletrophoretically resolves the products for detection of a signature consistent with monoclonality ."
the method works based on the differential pulse voltammetry - based electrochemical detection of protein coated paramagnetic microparticles that selectively capture the analyte ( psa ) .,demonstrated an electrochemical method for detection of prostate speci fi c antigen ( psa ) cancer markers .
but the external computer control system and syringe pumps prove to be a bottleneck in their use for poc applications .,the on - chip fl uid function is handled by computer controlled syringe pumps and reports enhanced performance due to fully automated fl uidic operations .
cardiovascular diseases ( cvd ) are responsible for nearly half of the deaths in the western world .,studies suggest the acute and long term fi nancial burden of cardiac disease to be substantial .
"the i - stat system ( abbott point of care inc . , usa ) is a commercial test cartridge for electrochemical detection of ctni .",presented a micro fl uidic - based impedimetric sensing device for cardiac enzymes .
"thus , micro fl uidics is likely to be driven to the poc rather than to large reference laboratories .","the reverse of high - throughput screening ( multiple samples with one target ) is multiplexed screening , where one sample is tested for multiple agents or biomarkers ."
most of the loc products are still focused on the business - to - business segment and not the business - to - consumer .,there needs to be more focused research on micro fl uidic product development including issues like manufacturability and cost dynamics and a simultaneous search for new application areas where micro fl uidics could be applied .
regularly - collected fecal samples and samples obtained from the digestive tract of animals sacrificed one month after inoculation were cultured in selective media and isolates were characterized .,blood samples were used to genotype the polymorphisms of the pigs ' intestinal receptors for f4 and f18 e . coli adhesins .
"excretion peaked on the first week after inoculation with the o149 - f4 etec strain , and later for the other two .","an mcr - 1 gene transfer to other commensal isolates was observed only for o139 - f18 stec , while the loss of mcr - 1 from the inoculated strain occurred in all groups ."
"to our knowledge , eerimental models of colibacillosis in piglets have been developed with inoculation of cst - susceptible e . coli ( madec et al . , ; rhouma et al . , rhouma et al . , , b but not with cstresistant strains .","as these strains are frequently also resistant to many other antimicrobials ( delannoy et al . , ) , it became necessary to develop and evaluate novel control products or measures ."
"all three strains were resistant to colistin , sulfamethoxazole , trimethoprim , tetracycline , and ampicillin .",strains - 246 and - 269 were also resistant to gentamicin and chloramphenicol .
"a rifampicin - resistant mutant ( 12 - 246 m , - 269 m , and - 220 m ) was prepared from each strain by culturing a large amount of inoculum on rifampicin - supplemented media ( 250 mg / l ) .","dna from the three mutants was prepared using qiamp dna mini kits ( qiagen , courtaboeuf , france ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions ."
"contigs were identified using megablast on a local nt database ( chen et al . , ) , and those corresponding to "" uncultured soil fungus "" were deleted .","we next performed spades assemblies on cleaned reads ( bankevich et al . , ) and mira assemblies ( chevreux et al . , ) on related raw reads ."
"each bacterial pellet obtained after centrifugation ( 5180 g , min ) was re - suspended in peptone buffered solution in order to obtain a titer of colony - forming units ( cfu ) / ml .","to prepare the inocula , each mutant was cultured in mueller hinton ( mh ) broth containing colistin ( 2 mg / l ) for h at c , under gentle agitation ."
the piglets are left with the sow until weaning and bred in a pathogen - free environment .,"the spf piglets are naturally born from hysterectomy - derived sows controlled for presence of classical and african swine fever , aujesky ' s disease , footand - mouth disease , h1n1 / h3n2 swine influenza , transmissible gastroenteritis / porcine respiratory coronavirus , porcine parvovirus , reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus , porcine circovirus type , border disease , mycoplasma hyopneumoniae , pasteurella multocida , bordetella bronchiseptica , actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae , haemophilus parasuis , streptococcus suis type , salmonella , lawsonia intracellularis , brachyspira hyodysenteriae , yersinia , campylobacter , listeria monocytogenes , balantidium coli and trichomonas ."
"on the same day , eight piglets per room ( four piglets per pen ) in animal rooms e2 , e3 , and e4 , ( respectively named groups g2 , g3 , and g4 , eight pigs each ) were orally inoculated with ml of the inocula prepared with strains - 246 m , - 269 m , and - 220 m respectively .","on day , five piglets in animal room e1 ( group , five pigs ) were orally inoculated with ml of sterile broth ."

"moreover , l of the / 10 thawed dilutions was enriched overnight in ml of rifampicin - supplemented lb broth ( 250 mg / l ) before plating on rifampicin - supplemented macconkey plates .",the limit of detection was cfu without enrichment and cfu / g after enrichment .
"their identity and the presence of the mcr - 1 gene were checked by pcr , and their resistance to rifampicin was tested by culture on rifampicin - supplemented mh media ( 250 mg / l ) .","when e . coli colonies were observed , two colonies per sample were stored and further analyzed ."
"briefly , a fragment of the mucin gene was amplified using hemo klen taq polymerase ( neb , evry , france ) and digested with xbai .","the bp amplified muc4 pcr fragment of the resistant allele is indigestible , unlike the susceptible allele ."
"( meijerink et al . , ) in which amplification followed by restriction with cfoi enables discrimination between the different alleles , based on the number of amplified fragments : two fragments for homozygous a / a , three for homozygous g / g and four for heterozygous .","the resistance is associated with allele a ( meijerink et al . , ) ."
"thus , beside the previously described mcr - 1 gene and the mutations in genes possibly involved in resistance to polymyxins ( delannoy et al . , ) , the strains harbored the genes coding for their other observed resistances : sulfonamides ( sul1 , sul2 or sul3 ) , trimethoprim ( dfra1 ) , tetracycline ( tet ( a ) ) , chloramphenicol ( cata1 , cmla1 ) , ampicillin ( bla tem1a or bla tem1b ) or aminoglycosides ( aac - iia , aac - iva , aada1 , aada3 , aada24 , aph - ia , aph - 1 c , aph - ia , stra or strb ) .",sequencing enabled us to detect the resistance genes present in the isolates .
"the two f18 stx2 - positive strains belonged to st and , whereas the o149 f4 strain containing genes coding for the lt , sta and stb toxins belonged to st - 100 .","the genes previously detected by microarray ( delannoy et al . , ) were confirmed to be present ."
"for the f18 receptor , ten pigs were heterozygous ag and the other were homozygous gg .","as eected , muc4 and muc13 gene results were in agreement , and only five animals were found to be of the genotype resistant to e . coli f4ac / ab : one in group g1 , two in g2 , and two in g3 ( table ) ."

"most isolates obtained directly on rifampicin - supplemented media ( 218 / 229 , %) or after enrichment in rifampicin - supplemented media ( 70 / 83 , %) harbored the mcr - 1 gene and showed the eected characteristics of the inoculated strains .","considering only isolates obtained without enrichment , for group g2 , out of isolates shared the characteristics of inoculated strain - 246 m , and one isolate obtained on day , without enrichment , belonged to pgg a , had the eric and pfge profiles and the antimicrobial susceptibility of - 246 m , including resistance to colistin , although it was negative for the mcr - 1 gene ."
positive pigs were detected in the two pens for groups g3 and g4 ( table ) .,"; and for g4 , three pigs were positive on day ."

the average body weight at puberty is to lb ( 2.3 to kg ) or % of adult body weight .,persian and related breeds may not have their first estrus until months of age or older and may not be sexually mature until to years of age .
this type of prolonged estrus is most commonly seen in siamese and related breeds .,"other queens with prolonged behavioral estrus , however , have normal distinct patterns of follicular growth ."
the duration of interestrus can range from to days but on average is days .,"during this time , the plasma estradiol level is low ( < 15 pg / ml [ < 55.1 pmol / l ] ) and no sexual behaviors are seen ."
"during this time , progesterone and estrogen are at baseline concentrations ( progesterone < 1 ng / ml [ . 2 nmol / l ] , estrogen to pg / ml [ 29.4 to pmol / l ] ) .",the luteal ( diestrus ) phase of the queen ' s estrous cycle is the period after ovulation when the dominant hormone is progesterone .
"mating may shorten the length of estrus , although conflicting evidence exists .","a queen in estrus will crouch with the front legs pressed to the ground , the back in a position of lordosis , and the tail turned to one side to present the vulva ( figure - 1 ) ."
"as for other induced ovulators , recent research suggests the corpus luteum ( cl ) may be the primary source of progesterone throughout pregnancy in the cat .",conflicting evidence from earlier research showed maintenance of pregnancy despite ovariectomy at to days of gestation and demonstrated the ability of the feline placenta to synthesize progesterone .
most queens will return to estrus about weeks after weaning their kittens if it is still the breeding season .,"however , it is entirely possible for a queen to return to estrus while still nursing ."
unrecognized spontaneous ovulation and subsequent pseudopregnancy is one important cause for infrequent estrous cycles that must be ruled out in cases of apparent infertility .,"it is more appropriate to consider the queen to be both an induced and spontaneous ovulator , particularly when investigating cases of infertility or pyometra in a breeding cattery ."
"queens are most fertile between the ages of about months to years , although examples of successful production of kittens in aged queens have been reported .","the ancient egyptian goddess of fertility , bastet , was portrayed as a cat for good reason ."
one study of eight queens in a feral colony concluded that queens avoid breeding with closely related toms but not distant relatives .,"breeders of pedigreed cats attempt to exert control over reproduction and plan pairings based on many factors , such as the qualities ( e . g . , health , color , conformation ) desired in the offspring ."
queens younger than year of age may have irregular estrous cycles and may not display mature maternal behavior .,"queens should be fully mature and in good body condition before they are first bred , both to ensure a successful breeding and to ensure a healthy pregnancy and good postpartum care of the kittens ."
"during pseudopregnancy , progesterone concentrations start to decline by about day to and are less than to ng / ml ( < 3.2 to nmol / l ) by day to .",the feline cl may be preprogrammed to atrophy after to days unless luteotrophic factors are present .
"however , reports of ovulation without breeding are found in the veterinary literature .",pyometra and mucometra are not uncommon in middle - aged intact virgin queens .
"however , of these queens had luteal phase ovaries , established by histologic examination .","of the queens , had no recent eure to male cats ."
up to days before the tom cat is comfortable again .,"as well , % of the queens had evidence of spontaneous ovulation during the months before the male cat entered the room ."
"for the next several minutes the queen will roll and thrash on the ground , stretching and licking at the perineum .",the tom cat should have an avenue of escape ; the breeding area should be roomy or should have usable vertical space .
"benzodiazepine tranquilizers , such as alprazolam , may be used in moderate doses but some adverse effects of these drugs ( e . g . , paradoxical aggression , ataxia ) may be unpredictable and undesirable .","phenothiazine tranquilizers , such as acepromazine maleate are contraindicated , because they may interfere with release of lh ."
"ideally , all cats in a cattery should be tested negative for feline leukemia virus ( felv ) and feline immunodeficiency virus ( fiv ) and any incoming cats should be tested and confirmed free of infection before joining the cattery population .","before breeding , queens should be free of internal and external parasites ."
it may take box - 2 reproductive data collection for breeding queens about to days .,"if the area is cleaned too thoroughly , especially if a scented cleaner is used , some tom cats will ignore or even attack a visiting queen until the territory has been re - marked ."
"medroxyprogesterone acetate ( depo - provera , pfizer [ new york , ny ] , related breeds that appear to have reduced fertility .","megestrol acetate ( ovaban , intervet / schering - plough animal health [ summit , nj ] and others ) is effective for suppressing estrus in queens when given orally , starting in anestrus ( 2.5 to mg / cat once daily for days , then once weekly ) ."
a list of drugs for control of estrus and reproduction in the queen can be found in table .,"for these reasons , safe and effective methods of nonsurgical contraception are necessary ."
"although ovariohysterectomy and histopathology were not performed on these queens , six of eight treated queens that were bred after return to estrus had normal pregnancies .","the implants used in these two studies were manufactured by different companies , so that differences in formulation may account for some of the variability in study outcomes ."
"sustained eure to gnrh analogues causes downregulation of gnrh receptors and decreased release of lh and fsh , thereby suppressing fertility .","gnrh analogues are under investigation primarily for control of reproduction in male and female dogs , while few studies have been published for cats ."
a single oral dose of megestrol acetate ( 2 mg / cat ) is reported to prevent implantation of fertilized eggs .,there are several protocols for induction of midpregnancy abortion in the queen .
"adverse effects of progestins are well known and include diabetes mellitus , uterine disease and infertility , adrenocortical suppression , mammary hyperplasia , and mammary neoplasia .",", , , progestins are not approved for use in the queen in all countries ( the most notable are the united states and canada ) because of the potentially serious adverse effects ."
"no changes in development of safe , effective , ineensive contraceptives that would be easy to administer to large groups of cats , especially free - roaming or feral cats .",one such approach may be immunocontraception - the use of the immune system to block fertility .
"knowledge of the clinical appearance , diagnosis and treatment options for these common conditions is an essential part of feline practice .",even the practitioner that does not have pedigreed cat breeders as clients will be presented with certain common problems of the reproductive system in cats .
"caution must be exercised with interpretation of baseline estradiol and progesterone concentrations ; however , as there is considerable fluctuation with time .","documentation of serum estradiol levels greater than pg / ml ( greater than pmol / l ) while signs of estrus are occurring is also consistent with ors , although the diagnosis cannot be ruled out if estradiol levels are low ."
"the mechanism of action is luteolysis by inhibition of prolactin release , a luteotrophic hormone in the queen .","in a feral cat colony , oral cabergoline ( 5 to gkg / day , to effect [ typically days ] ) was successful in inducing abortion when started after day of pregnancy ."
"one large study evaluated the efficacy of aglepristone ( 15 mg / kg , sc , repeated hours later ) after days of pregnancy in queens .","termination of pregnancy was achieved in % of the queens , with % of pregnancies terminated within days ."
biopsy of affected tissue and histopathology will confirm the diagnosis of mh .,"the diagnosis is made by clinical signs , patient signalment and history ."
mammary status was determined to be % and specificity to be %.,the remaining % are benign and are predominately mammary hyperplasia ( also called fibroepithelial hyperplasia and mammary fibroadenomatous hyperplasia ) .
"however , segmental aplasia may cause failure to conceive associated with fluid accumulation in the uterine lumen , depending on the location of the occlusion .","failure to remove the ipsilateral ovary is likely to result in ovarian remnant syndrome and necessitate an eloratory laparotomy at a later date . when one normal uterine horn and ovary are present , the queen may have normal estrous cycles and may even become pregnant ."
"although many pedigreed cat breeders are knowledgeable about these aspects of feline reproduction , the general public often is not .","occasionally , practitioners may be called upon to evaluate a pregnant queen or a queen in the midst of labor and delivery ."
aglepristone may not be available or licensed for cats in every country .,"six of the queens were subsequently bred , and four delivered normal litters ."
radiography is useful for determining the number of fetuses by counting the number of skulls present ( figure ) .,"test sensitivity for determination of reproductive enlargement may be detected , which could be consistent with either pregnancy or uterine disease , such as pyometra ."
"this change in the nipples , which become noticeably pinker and easier to see as the hair around them recedes somewhat and the nipples increase in size , is most obvious in maiden queens .","one of the first physical indications of pregnancy is "" pinking "" of the nipples , which occurs around day to after ovulation ."
"toward the end of pregnancy , the heads of fetuses may be very easy to palpate .","they remain distinctly palpable up to about days , when the fetuses and placentas become large enough that they cannot easily be distinguished individually ."
normal pregnancies lasting less than days or more than days are rare and are often associated with high neonatal mortality .,"during a breeding life , most queens will establish a fairly predictable pattern for length of gestation ."
"the fibula , calcaneus , and phalanges may not become visibly mineralized before parturition .","mineralization of the humerus and femur occur over the narrowest range , while the ulna , fibula , and pelvic bones have more variable mineralization times ."
"ideally , the measurements should be taken between and days postbreeding .","using ultrasound measurements , the due date can be estimated days about % of the time ."
"however , ultrasonography may not be as good as radiography for determining the number of fetuses present .","early fetal death is also identifiable , because examinations performed on consecutive days will show that the gestational sacs decrease in size ( figure - 7 ) ."
the queen ideally should have a full bladder to move the bowel out of the way and also move the uterine body out of the pelvic canal so that it is more readily imaged .,"however , it is still possible to get a false negative pregnancy diagnosis early in pregnancy if the hair coat was not clipped ."
"in general , high - quality diets designed for growth or reproduction and lactation are appropriate for the pregnant queen .","in a study designed to evaluate the commercially available relaxin test kit , queens were mated and pregnancy is lost ; the remaining weight is used for milk production ."
""" morning sickness "" has not been documented in the queen , nor have diet cravings .","there is no need to restrict activity , although most queens become less active and eat smaller meals more frequently during the last trimester because of rapid abdominal enlargement ."
"about week before delivery , most queens will exhibit nesting behavior and will spend time in the nest box that has been provided or a site of their own choosing .","most queens wish to be secluded during delivery , but a few will want to be near the owner ."
"however , this cannot be used meet the nutritional needs of nursing kittens .","in dogs , the fetal heart rate shows a significant decrease in the days before whelping , and this can be used to predict delivery ."
"in a large survey of pedigreed queens , the time from delivery of the first kitten to delivery of the last kitten was less than hours in the majority of cases , but it was more than hours in % of queens .","in extended deliveries , the queen may nurse the kittens already born , giving the appearance that delivery is finished ."
the queen may or may not eat the placentas ; there is no evidence that it is necessary for the queen to do so .,"since stage and labor happen concurrently in the queen , delivery of kittens is interspersed with delivery of placentas ."
"another sign that active labor will begin within to hours is the presence of milk in the mammary glands , although in some queens , milk comes in up to days before delivery of the litter .",labor typically begins when the temperature has dropped one full degree ( usually to about f [ 37.5 c ] or less ) and obvious signs should appear in to hours .
"no visible contractions are seen , although there may be a clear mucous discharge from the vagina .","queens may not eat for up to hours before active labor , although some queens eat normally through stage labor ."
"the queen can be seen bearing down , but crying out is uncommon .","strong , visible uterine contractions deliver each kitten from its uterine horn , into the uterine body and through the cervix and vagina ."
"should be monitored for signs of abnormal vulvar or mammary discharge , fever , anorexia , or neglect of the kittens ( box - 4 ) .",it is normal to be unable to eress milk from the queen ' s mammary glands as long as the kittens are gaining weight .
"on the occasions where the practitioner is presented with an apparent dystocia , it is important to understand the characteristics of dystocia in the queen , along with causes and effective treatments .","most queens deliver their kittens uneventfully , without the need of human intervention ."
"dystocia ( from the greek "" dys "" meaning difficult or abnormal and "" tokos "" meaning birth ) is defined as a painful , slow , or difficult delivery .","it is not always easy to differentiate normal parturition from dystocia , especially in the queen , where prolonged time between the births of kittens is normal in a small percentage of cases ( box - 5 ) ."
"once delivery of the litter is complete , the queen will lie down on her side , curled around the kittens to protect and warm them and encourage them to nurse .",normal kittens have a strong suckle reflex and will knead the mammary gland while nursing to promote milk letdown .
poor maternal behavior may account for queens that repeatedly cannibalize kittens without apparent reason .,"potential causes include pain ( e . g . , from mastitis , metritis , or postsurgical pain ) , stressful conditions , and overcrowding ."
"the owner should ensure the queen has easy access to a litter box as well as food and water , and the queen should be monitored for adequate nutritional intake .","by the time the kittens are about weeks of age , the queen spends less time with them and often stands when they attempt to nurse ."
"ultrasonographically , uterine involution is virtually complete by days postpartum , much earlier than in the bitch .",a retrospective study of cases of feline dystocia in sweden found a higher incidence in persians than other breeds .
primary and secondary uterine inertia are the most common maternal factors and account for the majority of dystocia cases .,primary uterine inertia is complete failure of initiation of effective uterine contractions .
"the prevalence of dystocia in the queen has been evaluated in a few studies , although data is conflicting .","the overall prevalence of dystocia in , 928 litters in the united kingdom was %."
"breed was not identified as a risk factor in this study , although small litter size was significantly associated with risk of cesarean section .","another survey of pedigreed cat breeding in the united kingdom was not designed to evaluate the prevalence or causes of dystocia , but it reported that % of , 056 litters were born by cesarean section ."
"calcium therapy has been shown to be effective in bitches that failed to respond to oxytocin alone , even in the face of normal serum calcium concentrations .","criteria for use include weak and ineffective contractions , poor response to oxytocin alone , and the presence of hypocalcemia ."
"although not strictly a type of inertia , delivery may be interrupted if a queen is disturbed or stressed , and will not resume until the queen feels calm and secure .","it may also occur during dystocia from another cause , such as obstruction resulting from fetal malpresentation ."
cephalopelvic disproportion may occur in brachycephalic or dolicocephalic breeds and cause obstructive dystocia .,"fetal causes of dystocia include fetal defects , unusually large fetuses ( often seen with one or two kitten litters ) , fetal death , and malpresentation ."
"the diagnostic plan for dystocia includes collection of a reproductive and medical history , a physical examination ( including abdominal palpation , rectal palpation of the pelvis , and vaginal examination ) , laboratory testing ( minimum data required : complete blood count , serum calcium and glucose ) , and abdominal radiographs ( to evaluate fetal size , number , and position ) .","the diagnosis of dystocia involves certain criteria , such as interruption of a normal delivery ( obstruction or secondary inertia ) or failure of initiation of labor at term ( primary inertia ) , maternal compromise ( depression , shock ) or fetal distress ( decreased heart rate ) ."
copious amounts of sterile lubricant are necessary and can be applied around the kitten using a soft red rubber catheter .,"if a kitten is visible at the vulva , it may be possible to deliver it with manipulation ."
risks of ovariohysterectomy at the time of cesarean section for the queen include hypovolemia and hemorrhage .,"en bloc removal of the pregnant uterus and ovaries with subsequent hysterotomy and removal of fetuses has been recommended when speed is required because of the condition of the queen , but the technique is controversial because of concerns about high neonatal mortality ."
"other indications include systemic illness in the queen , evidence of fetal distress , and primary uterine inertia ( box - 7 ) .",an anesthetic and surgical plan should be followed that maximizes the chances for survival of the queen and kittens .
"the queen should be prepared as much as possible before induction of anesthesia , including clipping of hair and surgical preparation .","intravenous fluid therapy should be administered before and during surgery , and any metabolic abnormalities should be addressed ( e . g . , hypocalcemia , hypoglycemia ) ."
recognition of these differences is important for successful management of postpartum problems .,features of many postpartum problems in the queen are different from similar problems in the bitch .
"after discharge , oral supplementation is started at to mg calcium gluconate daily or mg / kg calcium carbonate daily in divided doses until kittens are weaned .",calcium supplementation before parturition is not recommended for queens at risk of eclampsia as it may down regulate parathyroid hormone secretion and actually increase the risk of eclampsia .
treatment to evacuate the uterus may take several days and is not recommended in severely ill queens .,"other drug choices for uterine evacuation include prostaglandin f alpha ( 0.1 to mg / kg , sc ) or cloprostenol ( 1 to g / kg , sc ) every to hours to effect ."
cytology of milk from an infected gland will show degenerate neutrophils and bacteria .,severe cases may progress to abscessation and necrosis of skin and tissue ( figure - 11 ) .
"abdominal radiographs or ultrasound images should be obtained to look for fetal death , retained placentas or an enlarged uterus .",cytologic examination of the vaginal discharge shows degenerate neutrophils with intracellular bacteria .
", serum progesterone levels greater than ng / ml confirm ovulation has occurred and may be associated with pregnancy or pseudopregnancy .",patient - side test kits for canine serum progesterone have been validated for use in the cat .
culture of vaginal samples in queens without vulvar discharge is not informative as a wide variety of bacteria inhabit the normal feline vagina .,", relative numbers of vaginal bacteria are higher in young cats and increase parturition occurred more than hours previously ."
"occasionally , young or nervous queens may have delayed milk letdown or poor milk production .","prolactin does not act alone , but through a complex interplay with other hormones , including oxytocin ."
"use of a trichrome stain will color cells containing keratin red , and cells without keratin will appear blue .",the swab is rolled on a microscope slide to deposit the cells ; the smear is air dried and then stained with any product used to stain blood films .
housing anestrus queens with queens that are exhibiting regular estrous cycles may also be beneficial .,evaluation and correction of daylight should always be performed before attempting hormonal induction of estrus .
this absence of overt estrous behavior may be erroneously interpreted as failure to cycle by the owner .,"these "" silent heats "" may also occur in queens living in crowded or stressful conditions ."
silent heats may be diagnosed by evaluation of vaginal cytology once or twice weekly to detect cytologic signs of estrus .,queens confirmed with silent heats should be removed from their current situation and either housed separately or in a smaller group of cats .
"if more than one queen in a cattery is eeriencing infertility , a site visit may uncover contributing management or environmental conditions .","stressors that are common in catteries include frequent exhibition and travel , overcrowding , extremes of temperature variation and antagonistic social interactions ."
the effect of many drugs on reproduction in cats is not known .,part of the medical history for a queen vaginal cytology specimens and making air - dried smears at home .
a common presentation for infertility in the queen is failure to exhibit normal estrous cycles .,causes include immaturity or senility and primary anestrous or secondary anestrus .
"because the age at first estrus is variable and influenced by many factors , such as breed and season , immaturity should be ruled out as a cause of failure to exhibit estrous cycles in young queens .","the first estrus generally occurs between and months of age ( range , to months ) ."
diagnosis of sex and gonadal abnormalities requires examination of any abnormal reproductive structures and karyotyping .,"male pseudohermaphrodites appear phenotypically female , but have a small vagina and vulva with an enlarged clitoris ."
persistent anestrus may occur in queens previously known or suspected to exhibit normal estrous cycles .,"if the queen ' s full medical history is unknown , previous ovariohysterectomy or ovariectomy should be ruled out with evaluation of serum luteinizing hormone concentration ."
the most commonly reported ovarian tumor is the granulosa cell tumor .,"the average age of affected queens is years , and clinical signs include prolonged or irregular estrous cycles , aggression , and hair loss ."
"maternal abnormalities , such as inbreeding depression , congenital defects , and uterine disease , may cause infertility in a queen with normal estrous cycles .","the fertility of the tom cat , although difficult to investigate , should also be considered ( see chapter ) ."
inbreeding may be a cause of subfertility in queens with a normal estrous cycle .,queens that are difficult to breed may pass on undesirable reproductive traits to the next generation .
vaginal strictures secondary to trauma during parturition are possible but uncommon .,"congenital defects , such as vulvar or vaginal abnormalities , are a rare cause of problems with intromission ."
"with infertility should include a list of any recently administered medications , including nonprescription drugs , nutritional supplements , and botanicals .","certain drugs are known as disruptors of estrous cycles by inhibiting secretion of gonadotropins ( e . g . , progestins , androgens , anabolic steroids , glucocorticoids ) ."
fluid present in cystic structures or in the uterine lumen readily supports bacterial growth .,"progesterone also inhibits local leukocyte responses and decreases myometrial contractility , which increases the risk of ascending bacterial infection ."
", pregnancy appears failure to ovulate is suspected when a queen returns to estrus less than days after breeding .",it is associated with serum progesterone concentrations less than to ng / ml in the absence of a confirmed pregnancy .
those more invasive methods may be appropriate for valuable breeding queens .,"during laparotomy , the uterus and oviducts can be assessed for impatency secondary to congenital defects , hyperplastic change , or scarring ."
"diagnosis of pyometra is based on history , signalment , clinical signs , and physical examination findings .",an intact queen with vulvar discharge should be assumed to have pyometra until proven otherwise .
queens with closed cervix pyometra have to protect the uterus against pathologic changes .,"pyometra may produce either segmental or diffuse uterine enlargement , both of which may be mistaken for pregnancy on abdominal palpation ( figure - 18 ) ."
"in many cases , the diagnosis is not confirmed until the uterus is examined after ovariohysterectomy ( figure - 17 ) .","a presumptive diagnosis is often made in queens that repeatedly ovulate after breeding but do not conceive , provided breeding management is appropriate and the fertility of the tom cat is proven ."
therapeutic decisions should be based on the health status and age of the queen as well as reproductive value .,"ovariohysterectomy is the treatment of choice for queens with closed cervix pyometra , critically ill queens , queens with uterine rupture or retained fetal material , and for queens without value to a breeding program ."
"in addition to broad - spectrum antibiotics , medical options for treatment include prostaglandins and antiprogestins .","young ( < 5 years of age ) , otherwise healthy nonpregnant queens with open cervix pyometra and reproductive value may be managed medically in an attempt to preserve fertility ."
"however , luteolysis does not reliably occur with this drug in queens , especially early in diestrus .","prostaglandin f alpha ( lutalyse , pfizer animal health ) , also known as dinoprost tromethamine , is a naturally occurring prostaglandin administered to induce luteolysis and evacuation of uterine contents ."
"the average length of treatment is to days , but treatment may be required for up to days .","queens may be hospitalized during treatment for observation , especially during the first few days ."
"although pregnancy loss is a type of infertility , it must be investigated with specific etiologies in mind .","ideally , the queen should be evaluated as soon after the event as possible to increase the chances of a definitive diagnosis ."
breeders may use such products despite lack of scientific evidence of safety or efficacy .,"information about herbal , homeopathic or traditional supplements that may have been administered to the queen or added to the diet should be sought ."
"restlessness , panting , vomiting , defecation , tenesmus , salivation , and vocalizing have all been reported to occur within minutes of administration .",", , the side effects are short lived and diminish with subsequent injections ."
"disadvantages of the drug include cost , lack of licensing in cats , and limited availability .","compared with pgf alpha , aglepristone is an efficacious treatment without side effects that is administered less frequently ."
"in addition , dietary supplements may contain substances harmful to the developing fetuses or that impair normal reproduction .","however , breeders may feed specialty commercial diets or home - prepared diets , either raw or cooked , that may not be appropriate for maintenance of pregnancy or that may contain pathogens ."
one study suggests that the effects of chronic taurine deficiency on reproduction may not be reversible .,"kittens born to taurine - deficient queens is preferred over radiography , because it provides more detailed information ."
early fetal death and resorption usually do not result in clinical signs of illness .,"when fetal death occurs later in gestation , bloody or purulent vulvar discharge may occur , with or without clinical signs of illness ( e . g . , fever , anorexia , depression , vomiting , diarrhea ) ."
"spontaneous abortion will result in the death of all or part of the litter , but the queen ' s life is rarely at risk .",systemically ill queens should be hospitalized for stabilization with intravenous fluids and other therapies as needed .
"premature placental separation is associated with large amounts of bloody discharge late in gestation , and usually results in the loss of the litter .",excessive bleeding from the vulva is an indication for cesarean section in order to save the queen and possibly any live kittens .
"if kittens are aborted , the uterus should be examined ultrasonographically to determine if any fetuses or fetal membranes are retained .","the contents of the uterus can be evacuated with pgf alpha ( 0.25 mg / kg , im ) or ovariohysterectomy can be performed if the queen is not required for a breeding program ."
", although pregnancy loss is not as well studied in the queen as in the bitch , it appears the most important causes are noninfectious and viral .","a variety of potential causes of pregnancy loss , both infectious ( viral , bacterial , protozoal ) and noninfectious , have been identified in queens ( box - 13 ) ."
some drugs are known to produce teratogenic or lethal effects during pregnancy and should be avoided .,"these include certain antibiotics ( e . g . , chloramphenicol , metronidazole , tetracyclines , gentamicin ) , griseofulvin , nonsteroidal antiinflammatories , corticosteroids , misoprostol , testosterone and estrogen analogues , isotretinoin , antineoplastics , and organophosphate insecticides ."
"known genetic defects associated with pregnancy loss include single - gene traits , such as manx syndrome and polycystic kidney disease , where homozygotes die in utero .","fetal chromosomal errors , such as trisomy and , karyotypes , have been reported in the literature as causes of pregnancy loss ."
pregnancy loss may either be a direct effect of the virus or secondary to systemic illness and debilitation .,"the most important infectious causes of pregnancy loss in queens are viral diseases , such as feline herpesvirus - 1 , feline immunodeficiency virus , feline leukemia virus , and feline panleukopenia virus ."
feline leukemia virus ( felv ) can also be transmitted from an infected queen to kittens either in utero or in the postnatal period .,"transmission in utero may cause abortion , stillbirth , and low birth weights ."
this signalling pathway results in the eression of hundreds of effector genes known as interferon stimulated genes ( isgs ) .,"following its eression , ifn - a embarks upon a complex downstream signalling cascade called the jak / stat pathway ."
"during the last decade , a new appreciation for the role of ifns , specifically type , in targeting viral infection , has emerged .","by binding this receptor , type i ifns commence an intracellular signalling cascade that results in downstream effector mechanisms ."
"this has long been proven in studies using ifnar - deficient mice , that show increased susceptibility to viral infections , as a direct result of impaired ifn signalling .","while type i ifns have diverse roles , they are essential to eliminate viral infection ."
"recognition and binding of pamps induces activation of innate immune signalling cascades , which result in the generation of anti - viral , type i ifns and a spectrum of pro - inflammatory cytokines .",these prrs are the ' guards ' of the immune system and function to recognise these viral pathogen associated molecular patterns ( pamps ) .
"in fact , several prrs and prr signalling adaptors , most notably irf7 , are induced by type i ifns , which enables the type i ifn production to be maintained or possibly enhanced .","interestingly , components of innate immune signalling pathways , required for type i ifn production , can also be regulated by type i ifns themselves in a positive feedback loop ."
"there are three components of the jak / stat pathway : the cell receptor , jak proteins and stat proteins .","there are four members of the jak family [ jak , , and tyrosine kinase ( tyk ) ] and seven stats ( 1 - 4 , a , b and ) ."
"the isgf3 complex then translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus , where it binds to a dna sequence called the ifn - stimulated response element ( isre ) .","this binding triggers transcription of isgs , which are responsible for the effector properties of ifn - a ."
"in fact , ' ' isg research ' ' has now begun to elucidate how ifn - a re - programs the host ' s cellular biology , resulting in a state of enhanced anti - viral defence .",isgs carry out a broad range of effector functions ( table ) .
"as well as these ' ' effector ' ' isgs , numerous isgs are involved in the control of the actual ifn response .",these ' ' regulatory ' ' isgs are essential in returning normal balance to cellular homeostasis postinfection ( fig .
the same studies also showed that the presence of mx2 is required for the full anti - viral efficacy of ifn - a against hiv .,"mx2 functions in a similar manner to mx1 , by targeting and isolating viral fig ."
"however , more recent research has given deeper insight into ifitm function .","initially in , ifitms were shown to be strong inhibitors of influenza a virus ."
"trim5a was found to mimic the viral capsid via a hexagonal lattice formation , thus enabling virion binding .","trim5a is thought to function using two main mechanisms against hiv - 1 infection : it hastens the uncoating of the virion , thereby preventing viral reverse transcription and its e3ligase activity leads to enhanced degradation via the proteasome ."
"trim22 has also been implicated in other viral infections , including hepatitis b and influenza a .","clinical studies have shown that another trim member , trim22 , also plays a role in viral defence ; with higher trim22 levels correlating with lower viral load in hiv - 1 patients ."
the - oas family of proteins were first identified as ifn - induced proteins capable of inhibiting cellular protein synthesis .,"there are four oas genes in humans , oas1 , oas2 , oas3 and oaslike ( oasl ) ."
a study using an oasl deletion mutant discovered that it plays a role in suppressing replication of vesicular stomatitis virus by enhancing the rig - i pathway .,"recent research has focused on the oasl protein , which has shown evidence of both anti - viral and pro - viral activity ."
pkr carries out its anti - viral effector mechanisms by phosphorylating the eukaryotic translation initiation factor ( eif2a ) .,"eif2a phosphorylation , leads to sequestration of eif2b , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor which facilitates the recycling of gdp to gtp ."
further human studies are necessary to elucidate if patients receiving this drug are at increased risk of viral infections .,recent research efforts identified a key defence role for pkr against sars coronavirus .
two such examples are virus inhibitory protein endoplasmic reticulum associated ifn inducible ( viperin ) and tetherin .,"although most isgs target viruses at the ' ' pre - replication ' ' stage , several isgs have also been found to target viruses ' ' post - translation ' ' , before the viral proteins exit the infected cell ."
"some viruses , such as influenza a , bud from lipid rafts , which require this membrane fluidity .","a key mechanism of viperin is its ability to inhibit the enzyme farnesyl diphosphate synthase ( fpps ) , which when decreased , interferes with cell membrane fluidity ."
"exciting new research , looking at the specific relationship between tetherin and hiv - 1 , focused on the viral protein u ( vpu ) protein , which is known to target tetherin for degradation , as part of hiv - 1 ' s immune evasion tactics .",this study showed that mutations in vpu made the hiv - 1 virus more susceptible to antibody - dependant cell - mediated cytotoxicity ( adcc ) .
"in fact , the severe side - effects of egenous ifn - a during hcv therapy , including flu - like symptoms and neuropsychiatric disorders , highlight the need to control its signalling responses .","due to type i ifns maximising prr recognition of pathogens and strongly inducing immune effector mechanisms , their uncontrolled production has the potential to be detrimental to the host ."
"by doing so , they inhibit stat receptor binding and halt the propagation of downstream signalling .",socs proteins can even result in the degradation of the activated jak / stat complex through its ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation .
"together , these findings suggest that usp18 ' s regulatory activity may be specific to the signalling of type ifns .","indeed , important clinical implications result from ifn - a desensitisation , as high levels of usp18 mrna predict a poorer response to ifn - a treatment in hcv ."
type ifn signalling and the resultant eression of isgs is a superb example of an elegant immune mechanism of host defence .,"gaining a better understanding of this pathway and the function of individual isgs , will increase the likelihood of novel therapeutic development , aimed at enhancing our key primordial host effector functions ."
"through this research , we stand to gain an enriched understanding of viral invasion and indeed , evasion mechanisms and thus elicit new modes of harnessing this anti - viral activity via immunotherapeutic intervention .",novel research has led to paradigm shifts in our understanding of these innate immune anti - viral mechanisms of action .
"apart from the resulting high mortality rate ( currently estimated at about %) , this new disease was especially threatening in several respects .",the world health organization noted that ( a ) there is no vaccine and no treatment ; ( b ) initial symptoms are non - specific and common to other illnesses as well ; and ( c ) the incubation period is long enough for local and international transmission .
"people with chronic diseases had more reasons to worry : not only were they more susceptible to infection because of their already compromised health conditions ( drazen , ; peiris , yuen , osterhaus , & stohr , ) , once infected they had a higher mortality rate ( karlberg , chong , & lai , ) .","at the height of the epidemic , mask - donning hong kong people lived under widespread fear ."
"in addition to their own health worries , people with chronic diseases had to deal with the social stigma of being labeled as potential virus carriers .","according to a survey conducted in a sars - infected housing estate which was widely publicized by the media , nearly % of the estate residents eerienced avoidance and discrimination by relatives and colleagues ( hong kong mood disorders center , ) ."
"the debriefing process mainly involves recapitulation of the traumatic eerience , sharing of symptomatic reactions , education on cognitive coping , and finally a summarization that invites positive learning from the eerience .","the intervention is time - critical , recommended within a relatively short timeframe ( typically week ) after the traumatic event ."
"furthermore as events are unfolding , people face not only a traumatic past but also an uncertain future .",group intervention in this type of event should deal more with preparing for the future than with confronting the past .
"instead of symptom - focused , past - oriented psychological debriefing , an alternative debriefing model called strength - focused and meaning - oriented approach for resilience and transformation ( smart ) was proposed .","the model aimed to develop resilience in the face of adversity and to achieve positive growth after stressful events in three areas : body , mind and spirit ( see table ) ."
"through short lectures and physical exercises , participants recognize the interconnectedness of emotions and body functions ( chan , ho , & chow , ; ots , ) .","during the teaching phase , concepts of traditional chinese medicine are employed to help participants cope with fear and other emotions ."
"in pointing to mind - body connectedness , participants learn practical and concrete measures to improve their mental wellbeing ( e . g .",another feature of the smart debriefing is its adoption of a holistic view of health .
"emotional coping skills are coupled with meditation , guided imagery , and breathing techniques .",holistic view of health : the smart debriefing teaches easy - to - do physical exercises and provides dietary advices .
"however , practitioners should find little difficulty in adapting the message for clients in different cultures ( e . g .","for a christian perspective on spiritual coping , see baldacchino & draper , ) ."
we hypothesize the smart debriefing can promote positive growth among people with chronic diseases and reduce their distress levels at the same time .,"as linley and joseph observed in a meta - analysis of adversarial growth studies , ' [ it ] is unlikely that the passage of time per se influences adversarial growth , but rather intervening events and processes ' ( p . ) ."
"there were participants in the study , conveniently recruited through the community rehabilitation network , a non - profit organization in hong kong that provides support to people living with chronic diseases .","the most common diseases reported by participants are : diabetes mellitus ( n = 9 ) , heart disease , hypertension , cerebrovascular accident , systemic lupus erythematosus , and rheumatoid arthritis ."
"the intervention group received a whole - day psycho - educational program from : 30 am to : 00 pm , august , .",the structure of the program can be found in table .
"instead , participants who had debriefing increased their positive self - appraisals in the one - month follow - up .","it is hypothesized that such improvement was due to an increase of positive self - appraisals although negative self - appraisals decreased immediately after debriefing , the effect was not sustained ."
results suggest the smart debriefing can improve mental health and foster positive cognitive appraisals of the event .,"further study is needed , however , for the standardization of the protocol and the understanding of the underlying mechanism of change ."
we constructed a decision - analysis model to identify the most efficient strategies for managing undifferentiated fris within a hypothetical sars outbreak in new york city during the season of respiratory infections .,"in a future outbreak , rapidly and accurately distinguishing sars from other common febrile respiratory illnesses ( fris ) could be difficult ."
"o n july , , the world health organization ( who ) declared that human chains of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) had ended .","since then , new cases of sars have resurfaced in asia , including several in the absence of laboratory eures ."
"although reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) assays used to detect sars - cov can provide test results within a matter of hours , their suboptimal sensitivity makes them inadequate for ruling out sars .","moreover , existing serologic tests for sars - cov cannot definitively exclude infection until at least weeks has elapsed from the onset of symptoms and thus have no role in early clinical decision making ."
"however , existing diagnostic limitations place frontline healthcare practitioners in a precarious position , since clinical decisions with potentially dangerous consequences must be made in the face of uncertainty .",this distinction will also continue to be an important issue among travelers in whom fris develop after their return from sars - affected areas .
fris are defined herein as nonspecific infections caused by pathogens other than sars - cov for which the microbiologic origin cannot be determined on the basis of clinical grounds alone .,the analytic horizon of the analysis was defined as the eected lifetime of persons living in new york city during the - 2005 respiratory illness season .
"all relevant costs and benefits were considered from the societal perspective of new york city , including those related to secondary transmission of sars .",the analysis was conducted in adherence with the reference case scenario as defined by the panel on cost - effectiveness in health and medicine .
a third complementary strategy entailing mass influenza vaccination among the general population before the onset of respiratory season was considered in conjunction with the above competing strategies .,"a decision - analysis model was constructed by using data ( treeage software , williamstown , ma , usa ) that examined competing strategies in the context of a sars outbreak coinciding with respiratory season : ) home isolation for persons with fris of undetermined origin , pending fever and symptom resolution for at least hours and ) outpatient diagnostic testing of fris to ascertain a microbiologic diagnosis with subsequent test - driven management ."
"a plausible range of high and low values for each variable was used to conduct sensitivity analyses , which examined the influence of parameter error on the results of the analysis .",selected variables in the model are listed in tables and .
"in our model , the microbiologic origin of an fri was categorized into of mutually exclusive groups : ) sars - cov and coronaviruses oc43 and e ; ) influenza viruses a and b ; ) a panel of common respiratory pathogens , including respiratory syncytial viruses a and b , parainfluenza viruses - 3 , human metapneumovirus , bordetella pertussis , chlamydia pneumoniae , mycoplasma pneumoniae , legionella pneumophila , and l . micdadei ; and ) all other causes .","we used nationally representative data in conjunction with studies published in the medical literature ( 11 , to derive our base estimates for an "" average "" respiratory season ."
the proportion of fris due to influenza was derived from large observational studies conducted over multiple respiratory seasons and was corroborated by dividing the eected proportion of the u . s . population who get influenza each season by the proportion of the u . s . population having influenzalike infections .,"in our base - case analysis , we assigned the proportion of fris due to sars to be 1% , which was estimated assuming a sars outbreak of similar size and duration to the toronto outbreak ."
the first category constitutes rt - pcr assays capable of detecting sars - cov as well as coronaviruses oc43 and e .,"a second category includes multiplex pcr assays , which , when used in combination , can detect different respiratory pathogens , including influenza viruses a and b , respiratory syncytial viruses a and b , parainfluenza viruses - 3 , human metapneumovirus , c . pneumoniae , m . pneumoniae , l . pneumophila , l . micdadei , and b . pertussis ."
the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine was derived from the medical literature .,"to account for seasonal variation between circulating strains of influenza and the composition of the trivalent vaccine , we varied the effectiveness of the vaccine over a wide range of plausible values in our sensitivity analysis ."
"in our sensitivity analyses , we evaluated the incremental costs and benefits of raising vaccination rates above this seasonal average .",we used data from the u . s . behavioral risk factor surveillance system to estimate seasonal influenza vaccination rates among the population of new york city .
we assumed that adherence to public health guidelines in the setting of a widespread sars outbreak would be near universal .,"in our model , the home isolation strategy required persons with fris of undetermined origin to remain at home for at least hours after resolution of illness ."
"in this strategy , persons with fris of undetermined cause would observe home isolation precautions until the results of diagnostic tests were available .","we assumed that a positive sars rt - pcr test would require isolation precautions for the patient , public health intervention , and additional testing to confirm the diagnosis ."
"under each strategy , we considered the possibility that persons with fris seeking medical care might receive antimicrobial drugs during their evaluation .",we estimated this probability by using data from the national ambulatory medical care survey .
"mortality data for community - acquired pneumonia were obtained from the national center for health statistics ; data for sars , influenza , and respiratory syncytial virus were obtained from the medical literature .","we estimated that patients with sars would each transmit infection to other persons if appropriate isolation precautions were not observed ( e . g . , false - negative sars rt - pcr test combined with a false - positive test for an alternate diagnosis ) ."
"costs attributable to transportation , ambulatory care , laboratory tests , influenza vaccination , antimicrobial agents , hospitalization , public health investigation , and patient time were included in the analysis .","transportation costs to see a medical provider were derived by using u . s . national data and were adjusted to account for the estimated proportion of the population driving , using public transportation , or traveling by other means such as biking or walking ."
influenza vaccination and antimicrobial drug costs were obtained by using average wholesale prices of phar - maceuticals .,the costs and frequency of adverse reactions to influenza vaccination were estimated from the medical literature and incorporated into the net costs and benefits of the vaccine .
"per diem hospitalization costs for sars were approximated by using icd - 9 code , "" respiratory distress syndrome , "" which was subsequently multiplied by the average length of stay for hospitalized patients with sars .","public health costs , including contact investigation , were estimated from the toronto sars eerience ."
"when applicable , medical and nonmedical costs were adjusted to u . s . dollars by using the consumer price index .",the potential economic effects of a sars outbreak on tourism or other commercial industries were not considered in the analysis .
"in our base - case analysis , we found the use of multiplex pcr assays to detect infections with a broad panel of common respiratory pathogens to be the dominant strategy , saving $79 million and resulting in the gain of , 474 quality - adjusted life - years ( qalys ) relative to a strategy of home isolation .","if sars rt - pcr testing were used in conjunction with multiplex pcr assays in our base - case scenario , however , we estimate that costs would increase by about $87 million and have lower effectiveness than multiplex pcr testing alone ."
"if the described outbreak were to unfold , a campaign to increase influenza vaccination rates among the general population before the onset of respiratory season would save an estimated $5.0 million and lead to the gain of qalys for each percentage of new york city ' s population vaccinated above the seasonal baseline .","rapid influenza testing would be accomplished at an incremental cost of $9.0 million but would result in gains of , 286 qalys ( incremental costeffectiveness ratio of $1,702 per qaly gained ) ."
the results of sensitivity analyses are shown in table and figure .,"the total costs , the number of qalys gained , and the incremental cost - effectiveness of each strategy in the model is shown in table ."
"our analysis indicates that current diagnostic limitations in discriminating sars from other common fris could have enormous public health and economic consequences , particularly if epidemiologic links between sars cases were to become tenuous .","under such conditions , we found that most costs would not be related to sars infections themselves , but rather to procedural changes in the management of other fris due to the known or perceived presence of sars ."
"while the centers for disease control and prevention supports an approach of excluding sars by confirming an alternate diagnosis , caution is advised since sars coinfection with other respiratory pathogens , including the human metapneumovirus , has been documented .","this approach is the most cost - effective strategy under low prevalence conditions since the positive predictive value of sars rt - pcr tests would be extremely low , and false - positive sars tests would have deleterious societal repercussions ."
our sensitivity analyses indicate that sars diagnostic testing should not be performed unless the prevalence or pretest probability of sars among persons presenting with fris exceeds %.,"moreover , negative consequences on quality of life would occur when persons are incorrectly diagnosed as having an infection with sars ."
"third , the use of influenza vaccination as a means to distinguish sars from influenza has been debated .","in our analysis , we find that if sars reemerged during respiratory season , higher rates of influenza vaccination among the general population would lead to both health benefits and economic savings ."
"in our base - case scenario , in which sars represented 1% of all circulating fris , changes in sars rt - pcr test sensitivity had a negligible impact on overall societal costs and population health .","we estimated the sensitivity of current sars rt - pcr assays to be % ; however , we recognize that the type of specimen tested and the timing of collection can influence the test ' s sensitivity ."
"our reported test sensitivity for the multiplex pcr assays , which detect common respiratory viruses and bacteria , is lower than values reported in the medical literature .","since estimates in the literature reflect eerimental conditions and are essentially measures of test efficacy , we wished to estimate real - world effectiveness of these tests by taking into account factors such as ineffective specimen collection methods , delays in laboratory testing , or other related factors ."
"our analysis demonstrates that influenza vaccination would lead to cost - savings , which has been reported in other studies of healthy adults in the pre - sars era .","however , the specific benefits quantified in our analysis would only be realized if the conditions of the model were to occur , i . e . , the reemergence of sars during a respiratory season , when epidemiologic links between cases are poorly defined ."
"nonetheless , in our analysis the effect of sars coinfection on a population level is minimal given that sars - cov infections make up only 1% of all fris .",this issue is particularly relevant when considering sars coinfection with other respiratory organisms .
"even if the world does not eerience another large - scale , multinational outbreak , healthcare providers around the globe will continue to see patients with nonspecific fris who are incidentally returning from sarsaffected areas .",this fact underscores the importance of having evidence - based guidelines to facilitate the timely and accurate distinction of sars infections from other distinguishing febrile respiratory illnesses from sars fris of lesser public health importance .
for other virus families like the picornaviruses it is known that pathology is related to proteolytic cleavage of host proteins by viral proteinases .,"background : despite the passing of more than a year since the first outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) , efficient counter - measures are still few and many believe that reappearance of sars , or a similar disease caused by a coronavirus , is not unlikely ."
several proteins known to be cleaved by other viruses were submitted to prediction as well as proteins suspected relevant in coronavirus pathology .,a neural network was trained to recognise the cleavage sites in the genomes obtaining a sensitivity of % and a specificity of %.
"furthermore , the method might assist in design of proteinase inhibitors for treatment of sars and possible future diseases caused by coronaviruses .",our prediction method netcorona predicts coronavirus cleavage sites with high specificity and several potential cleavage candidates were identified which might be important to elucidate coronavirus pathology .
the abrupt appearance raises concern of another break - out of an epidemic of sars virus or similar strains in the future .,"the causative agent was shown to be a human coronavirus , a virus type which normally causes mild cold symptoms in humans ."
"viral polyprotein processing is a common theme in viral molecular biology , e . g .",the main proteinase cl pro performs at least eleven proteolytic cleavages within a single viral polyprotein .
we propose that a deeper understanding of coronavirus proteinase function and substrate specificity may benefit further research by : i ) increasing the understanding of substrate specificity determinants which may direct studies focusing on the development of specific proteinase inhibitors and ii ) providing a method for screening cellular target proteins for potential coronavirus proteinase cleavage sites .,"the general approach is still valid though , and we decided to apply this method to the problem of predicting the cl pro proteinase cleavage sites and identifying potential host cell target proteins ."
the method is based on known cleavage sites in seven members of the coronavirus family as the cleavage sites are believed to be sufficiently conserved among family members .,this notion is supported by the fact that the sars cl pro proteinase has recently been shown capable of catalysing the cleavage of peptide fragments from other coronaviruses at the eected cleavage sites .
this is reflected in the cleavage site logo although differences between the two are also apparent .,"positions p1 ' , p1 , and p4 have similar amino acid distribution in the c and cl proteinase cleavage sites ."
the posterior probability in the range to cannot be determined accurately since relatively few examples score in this interval - only % of the test set ( both positive and negative examples ) scores between and .,"however , results indicate that prediction scores can be classified into three categories , those that fall below are most likely not cleaved , those that fall between and are possibly cleaved and those above are most likely cleaved if available to the proteinase ."
"eukaryotic translation initiation factor gamma ( if4g_human ) has a potential cleavage site after gln838 ( 0.822 ) , but also at two other positions although with lower cleavage scores .",cleavage of this protein may lead to host cell shut - off in a similar way to what has been described for picornavirus a proteinase .
the protein is the second largest subunit of the rna polymerase iii complex and if this protein is indeed a cellular proteinase target it might cause disruption of the rna polymerase iii complex upon infection with a coronavirus .,"a similar disruption would be eected in case of a cleavage of the largest subunit of the complex ( rpa1_human ) which also has a predicted cleavage site ( at position , score 04 ) ."
the tumor - suppressor protein p53 is known to be cleaved by picornavirus c pro proteinase but this protein is not predicted to contain any coronavirus c pro proteinase cleavage sites .,"however , p53 - binding protein ( p531_human ) and p53 - binding protein ( p532_human ) , which stimulate p53 - mediated transcriptional activation , have several potential cleavage sites ."
another known target for viral infections is the microtubule - associated protein ( map - 4 ) which is cleavable in hela cells by the poliovirus c pro proteinase .,map - 4 ( map4_human ) might also be cleavable by cl pro albeit with a low score ( after gln with a score of 19 ) and furthermore microtubule - associated protein rp / eb member and ( mae1_human and mae3_human ) have sites which obtain scores above .
it has a predicted cleavage site with a high score ( 0.842 ) following gln762 in the human sequence .,the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( cftr_human ) is an atp - dependent chloride channel .
pattern % more of these proteins may lead to reduced presentation of viral peptides to cytotoxic t lymphocytes thereby inhibiting the cellular immune response .,irak - 1 ( ira1_human ) which is involved in il - 1 induced activation of cells has a predicted cleavage site after gln457 scoring 59 .
protein - 16 has been shown to enhance interferon antiviral efficacy .,interferon - induced protein - 16 precursor ( ini2_human ) is a membrane protein and was predicted to possess a cleavage site following gln97 ( 0.890 ) which is located in the cytoplasmic part of the mature protein .
"the predictor is highly specific which means that few false positives are eected , in fact on independent test sets we observed a false positive rate around %.",we have developed a neural network capable of identifying the cleavage site of the coronavirus proteinase cl pro and use this model to predict potential cleavage sites in host cell proteins .
"predicted sites even with high scores which are inaccessible to the proteinase ( like extracellular domains , transmembrane domains , or buried domains in globular proteins ) should be disregarded , as accessibility information is not available to the neural network .",cleavage sites probably exist that are not cleaved because they are not eed to the solvent sufficiently for the proteinase to work .
"finally , the method might facilitate proteinase blocking based drug discovery by providing hints about proteinase affinity to various non - cleavable peptide ligands , which is a possible strategy for drug development .",our method can be employed by researchers suspecting a possible viral proteinase cleavage but may also prove useful for researchers working with coronavirus function .
the basic idea behind the visualisation technique is that the height of each letter in a given position reflects its probability p k ( i ) .,the total height of the column reflects the total information content ( d ( i ) ) at that specific position in the alignment given by ( for proteins ) :
sparse encoding was used for translating the amino acids to data input for the networks as has been described previously .,the artificial neural networks used in this work were of the standard feed - forward type .
care was taken to ensure that all cleavage sites were equally distributed in every cross - validated set .,using an architecture with two hidden neurons and a symmetric window of nine amino acids centered on the glutamine in the p1 position it was possible to obtain a correlation coefficient of 4 on cross - validated test sets .
p ( x l ) is the fraction of prediction outcomes in bin x l .,"this can be calculated from the prior probability p ( c pos ) , which is the fraction of positive examples in the data set , and the classconditional probability p ( x l |c pos ) for positive examples , which is the fraction of positive examples in the bin x l ."
"each network outputs a score in the range [ 0.000 - 1.000 ] , where scores below indicate non - cleavage and scores above indicate potential cleavage .",this method is also employed by the prediction web server mentioned below .
"as mentioned , some potent nabs induce barely any changes in the epitopes .","indeed , less potent abs to overlapping sites sometimes generate greater changes ."
but these traits attest to the importance of neutralization in natural infection .,"when combined and richly developed , they also posit a formidable challenge to the induction of nabs through vaccination ."
roniviruses are the only members of the order nidovirales that are known to infect invertebrates .,"the family roniviridae includes the penaeid shrimp virus , gillassociated virus ( gav ) , and the closely related yellow head virus ( yhv ) ."
"more than full - length coronavirus genome sequences and around arterivirus genome sequences have been documented so far , whereas only very few sequences have been reported for toroviruses , bafiniviruses , and roniviruses .","therefore , information on the genetic variability of these nidovirus taxa is limited ."
"in , a previously unknown coronavirus that probably has its natural reservoir in bats crossed the species barrier and caused a major outbreak of sars , which led to more than deaths worldwide .","in humans and fowl , coronaviruses primarily cause upper respiratory tract infections , while porcine and bovine coronaviruses establish enteric infections , often resulting in severe economic losses ."
"roniviruses usually exist as asymptomatic infections but can cause severe disease outbreaks in farmed black tiger shrimp ( penaeus monodon ) and white pacific shrimp ( penaeus vannamei ) , which in the case of yhv can result in complete crop losses within a few days after the first signs of disease in a pond .","infections by arteriviruses can cause acute or persistent asymptomatic infections , or respiratory disease and abortion ( eav and prrsv ) , fatal age - dependent poliomyelitis ( ldv ) , or fatal hemorrhagic fever ( shfv ) ."
both the number and properties of structural proteins vary between viruses of the three families of the nidovirales and may even vary among viruses of the same family .,"nidoviruses usually encode at least three structural proteins : a spike ( s ) or major surface glycoprotein , a trans - membrane ( m ) or matrix protein , and the n protein ( figure ) ."
"the arterivirus envelope proteins form two higherorder complexes : one is a disulfide - linked heterodimer of gp and the m protein ; and the other is a heterotrimer of the minor structural glycoproteins gp , gp , and gp .","except for the e and m proteins , all arterivirus structural proteins are glycosylated ."
"in the group coronaviruses mhv and sars - cov , deletion of the e protein results in a dramatic reduction , of up to - fold , of virus infectivity .","the coronavirus e and sars - cov a proteins are viroporins , that is , they belong to a group of proteins that modify membrane permeability by forming ion channels in the virion envelope ."
the proteolytic processing occurs in a coordinated manner and gives rise to the functional subunits of the viral replication - transcription complex .,"thus , for example , ribosomal frameshifting is required for the eression of orf1b , and the two replicase polyproteins ( pp1a and pp1ab ) are proteolytically processed by viral proteases ."
the complex is anchored to intracellular membranes and likely also includes a number of cellular proteins .,"nidoviruses replicase genes include a conserved array of protease , rna - dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) , helicase ( hel ) , and endoribonuclease ( nendou ) activities ."
"with respect to the principal catalytic residues , there are major differences between the main proteases from different nidovirus genera .","the presence of a third , c - terminal domain is a conserved feature of nidovirus main proteases , even though these domains vary significantly in both size and structure ."
"nidovirus pl pro domains may include zinc ribbon structures and some of them have deubiquitinating activities , suggesting that these proteases might also have functions other than polyprotein processing .",bafini - and roniviruses have not been studied in great detail and it is not yet clear if these viruses employ papain - like proteases to process their n - terminal pp1a / pp1ab regions ( figure ) .
"except for arteri - and roniviruses , all nidoviruses encode an adrp domain that is part of a large replicase subunit ( nsp3 in the case of coronaviruses ) .","two other rna - processing domains , adp - ribose - 1 phosphatase ( adrp ) and nucleotide cyclic phosphodiesterase ( cpd ) , are conserved in overlapping subsets of nidoviruses ( figure ) ."
"although the highly specific phosphatase activity is not essential for viral replication in vitro , the strict conservation in all genera of the coronaviridae suggests an important ( though currently unclear ) function of this protein in the viral replication cycle .",the coronavirus adrp homolog has been shown to have adp - ribose - 1 - phosphatase and poly ( adp - ribose ) - binding activities .
"in toroviruses , the cpd domain is encoded by the end of replicase orf1a ( figure ) , whereas in group a coronaviruses , the enzyme is eressed from a separate subgenomic rna .",the cpd domain is only encoded by toroviruses and group a coronaviruses .
"these have been shown or postulated to trigger the modification of cytoplasmic membranes , including the formation of unusual double - membrane vesicles ( dmvs ) .","tethering of the replication - transcription complex to these virusinduced membrane structures might provide a scaffold or subcellular compartment for viral rna synthesis , possibly allowing it to proceed under conditions that prevent or impair detection by cellular defense mechanisms , which are usually induced by the double - stranded rna intermediates of viral replication ."
"for nsp9 and nsp10 , rna - binding activities have been demonstrated and crystal structures have been reported for both proteins .",nsp10 is a zinc - binding protein that contains two zinc - finger - binding domains and has been implicated in negative - strand rna synthesis .
"coronaviruses encode a variable number of accessory proteins , while the torovirus genome contains a single accessory gene encoding a hemagglutininesterase ( he ) .","in contrast to the large genome of coronaviridae , which can accommodate genes encoding accessory proteins ( i . e . , proteins called ' nonessential ' for being dispensable for replication in cell culture ( figure ) ) , the smaller genomes of arteriviruses only encode essential proteins ( figure ) ."
"of this set of five accessory proteins , only three homologs are encoded by the recently identified hcov - hku1 , which is the closest known relative of the cluster formed by mhv , hcov - oc43 , and bcov .","in contrast , the most distant group member , sars - cov , has seven or eight unique accessory genes , two between the s and e protein genes , four to five between the m and n protein genes , and orf9b which entirely overlaps with the n protein gene in an alternative reading frame ."
"for instance , mhvand sars - cov nsp2 turned out to be nonessential for replication in cell culture .",some functionally dispensable orf1a - encoded replicase domains may also be considered as accessory protein functions .
this process is mediated by the viral replication complex that includes all or most of the - 16 nsps derived from the proteolytic processing of the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins of arteriviruses and coronaviruses .,"the replication complex , which is likely to include also cellular proteins , is associated with modified intracellular membranes , which may be important to create a microenvironment suitable for viral rna synthesis as well as for recruitment of host factors ."
"studies with mhv di rnas have indicated that both genome ends are necessary for positive - strand synthesis , whereas only the last nt and the poly ( a ) tail at the genomic end are required for negative - strand synthesis .",genome regions harboring minimal cis - acting sequences have been mapped to around kb domains of the genomic and ends .
"the functional relevance of hnrnp a1 in coronavirus replication was supported by eeriments showing that its overeression promotes mhv replication , whereas replication was reduced in cells eressing a dominant - negative mutant of hnrnp a1 .",hnrnp a1 and ptb bind to the complementary strands at the end of coronavirus rna and could mediate the formation of an rnp replication complex involving the and ends of coronavirus genomic rna .
genes eressed through sg mrnas are preceded by conserved ' transcriptionregulatory sequences ' ( trss ) that presumably act as attenuation or termination signals during the production of the subgenome - length negative - strand rnas .,"in arteriviruses and coronaviruses , the trss preceding each orf are presumed to direct attenuation of negative - strand rna synthesis , leading to the ' jumping ' of the nascent negative - strand rna to the leader trs ( trs - l ) ."
"in contrast , sg mrna2 has a leader sequence that matches the - terminal nt of the genomic rna and its production requires a discontinuous rna - synthesis step reminiscent of , but not identical , to that seen in arteri - and coronaviruses .","of their four sg mrna species , the smaller three ( mrnas through ) lack a common leader and are produced via nondiscontinuous rna synthesis ."
the identification of host factors participating in nidovirus transcription is a field under development and specific binding assays have recently identified a limited number of cellular proteins that associate with cis - acting rna regulatory sequences .,"for example , the arterivirus nsp1 protein has been identified as a factor that is dispensable for genome replication but absolutely required for sg rna synthesis ."
this ancestor may have evolved from a smaller rna virus by acquiring the two nidovirus genetic marker domains represented by the helicaseassociated zinc - binding domain ( zbd ) and the nendou function .,"these two domains may have been used to improve the low fidelity of rdrp - mediated rna replication , thus generating viruses capable of efficiently replicating genomes of about kbp ."
coronaviruses and arteriviruses are clearly the best - studied members of the nidovirales in terms of their interactions with the host .,"also , most studies have been performed with viruses that have been adapted to cell culture and therefore may have properties that differ from those of field strains ."
"the underlying mechanisms have not been characterized in detail , but data obtained for mhv and bcov suggest that they may involve the - leader sequences present on coronavirus mrnas .","the viral n protein was reported to bind to the - common leader sequence and it has been speculated that this might promote translation initiation , leading to a preferential translation of viral mrnas ."
"apart from the downregulation of genes involved in translation and cytoskeleton maintenance , genes involved in stress response , proapoptotic , proinflammatory , and procoagulating pathways were significantly upregulated .","both mhv and sars - cov induce mitogen - activated phosphate kinases ( mapks ) , especially p38 mapk ."
"infection by the coronaviruses tgev , mhv , sars - cov , and ibv was reported to cause a cell cycle arrest in the g0 / g1 phase and a number of cellular proteins ( e . g . , cyclin d3 and hypophosphorylated restinoblastoma protein ) and viral proteins ( mhv nsp1 , sars - cov b a , and n proteins ) have been proposed to be involved in the cell cycle arrest in g0 / g1 .",nidoviruses have also been reported to interfere with cell cycle control .
"for instance , sars - cov was shown to infect epithelial cells of the intestinal tract and induce an antiapoptotic response that may counteract a rapid destruction of infected enterocytes .",these findings are consistent with clinical observations of a relatively normal endoscopic and microscopic appearance of the intestine in sars patients .
"thus , for example , there seems to be a direct link between the il - 8 plasma levels of sars patients and disease severity , similar to what has been described for pulmonary infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus .","in contrast , despite the upregulation of il - 8 in intestinal epithelial cells , biopsy specimens taken from the colon and terminal ileum of sars patients failed to demonstrate any inflammatory infiltrates , which may be the consequence of a virus - induced suppression of specific cytokines and chemokines , including il - 18 , in the intestinal environment ."
"ifn - a / b molecules signal through the type i interferon receptor ( ifnr ) , inducing the transcription of several antiviral mediators , including ifn - g , pkr , and mx .","ifn - g is critical in resolving coronavirus ( mhv and sars - cov ) , and also arterivirus ( eav , ldv , and prrsv ) infections ."
"however , prrsv infections or vaccination with attenuated - live prrsv vaccines cause only limited il - 1 , tnf - a , and ifn - a / b responses .",this then leads to ifn - g and th1 levels that fail to elicit strong cellular immune responses .
"viruses belonging to the family nodaviridae are small ( 28 - 37 nm ) , nonenveloped , and isometric .",these viruses characteristically package bipartite positive - sense rna genomes that are made up of rna1 ( 3.0 - 3.2 kb ) and rna2 ( 1.3 - 1.4 kb ) .
"alphanodaviruses have become model systems for studies on rna replication , specific genome packaging , virus structure , and assembly , and for studies on virus - host interactions that are required to suppress rna silencing in animal cells .","betanodaviruses , on the other hand , cause high mortalities in hatcheryreared fish larvae and juveniles , and are therefore economically important pathogens to the marine aquaculture industry ."
"in the republic of korea ( rok ) , a full - time infection control nurse ( icn ) and an infection control physician ( icp ) were appointed in , for the first time , at a national universityaffiliated hospital .","following the findings of the study on the efficacy of nosocomial infection control ( senic project ) , many countries defined the duties of hospitals for infection prevention and control and implemented legislation regulating the periodic accreditation of the quality of medical care ."
"over the last years , legislation and accreditation procedures have strongly influenced infection prevention and control programs .","since the revision of the regulation of medical service act in , hospitals with > 200 beds have been required to appoint an infection control committee and at least full - time eerienced staff member to oversee an infection control program ."
"continuous variables were eressed as mean sd or median ( interquartile range [ iqr ] ) and analyzed using the mann - whitney u test or student t test , as appropriate .","analysis of variance and tests were used to identify differences between the infection prevention and control programs according to hospital size , determined by the total number of beds ."
"the survey response rate was %, with hospitals divided into categories according to bed size : - 499 beds ( n = ) , - 699 beds ( n = ) , - 899 beds ( n = ) , and beds ( n = ) .","most of the hospitals were located in the metropolitan area ( n = , %) ."
"the median ratio of beds to sink was ( iqr , - 2.7 ) .","the median number of single rooms and cohort rooms for patient isolation was ( iqr , - 8 ) and ( iqr , - 8 ) , respectively ."
"the average number of personnel members specializing in infection prevention and control in each hospital was ( median , ; iqr , - 4 ; range , - 10 ) .","of these , ( median , ; iqr , - 3 ; range , - 9 ) were employed in a full - time position ."
all facilities have held periodic conferences on infection prevention and control .,"frequency was evaluated as follows : times per year ( n = , %) , times per year ( n = , %) , and > 3 times per year ( n = , %) ."
"regular environmental disinfection on the icus was performed once a day ( n = , %) , twice a day ( n = , %) or time a day ( n = , %) .","twelve facilities ( 29.3% ) conducted environmental cultures to detect mrsa , vre , mrab , mrpa , or cre on a routine basis ."
more infection specialists and the lower bed numbers per handwash stands were noted in larger hospitals ( table ) .,"however , supplies consumption and protocols for infection prevention and control seemed to have no difference by the size of the hospitals ( tables and ) ."
these findings may help to identify the optimal strategies to manage infection control and prevention programs effectively in the rok .,this study provides comprehensive information on the current status of facilities and staff personnel for infection prevention and control programs among hospitals in the rok .
"to date , there is no formal certification process to assess the practice of icns and ensure a minimum level of competence .",our study found a wide variation in the training and eerience of icns .
"routine surveillance culture for targeted mdros was conducted in % of hospitals ; however , only some hospitals isolated the carriers to single rooms : % for the patients in the icus , and % for those in the general ward .","of the responding hospitals , % have monitored the resistance proportion of major mdros and have shared their results in clinical practice ."
"on the other hand , the centralized management of the increase in mdros can be temporarily effective , under conditions of finite resources .","however , a comprehensive and multifaceted approach simultaneously covering the various mdros should be designed to minimize opportunity costs ."
"investment in development of single rooms and implementation of a comprehensive program are also required , with the support of a sensible policy on medical insurance fees .","this study demonstrates that despite policy changes , personnel resources for effective infection prevention and control programs in the rok need reinforcement , both in terms of the numbers of specialists and the quality of their training ."
"disease can impact on an individual , and can also affect a group or a population of cats .","with our current understanding , and with the multi - factorial nature of risk factors , preventing most non - infectious diseases is very difficult so we have to rely on early diagnosis and appropriate treatment ."
"infectious disease is particularly associated with young cats , whose immune system is not fully developed , and those kept in large groups .","disease has a significant impact on the welfare of cats and , ultimately , disease of one type or another will lead to their death ."
"the desire of some breeders to emphasise breed characteristics has led to ' ultra ' type cats , where inherent body form - associated problems have been compounded .","in some cases , the body form associated with a breed can cause long - term welfare problems , for example respiratory obstruction in brachycephalic cats such as persians ."
"at the population level , disease has its effect mainly on the genetic make - up of that population .","this can be a direct effect , associated with individuals dying from their disease or having passed on disease susceptibility to their offspring ."
"not all individuals within a population , however , need to be vaccinated in order to achieve this benefit .","vaccination , particularly primary vaccination , plays a central role in the control of infectious disease within populations ."
"it is clinical disease , however , that directly affects welfare so vaccination is a positive benefit to the population and to the majority of individuals .","vaccination may impact on virulence , as it tends to promote evolution of the infectious agent away from the vaccine strain ( s ) and this could potentially increase virulence ."
"vaccination is not without risks ( greene ) , although these are generally to the individual and most commonly occur as vaccine reactions ( see next section ) .","there is also the potential for modified live vaccines to cause clinical disease , if the vaccine is administered incorrectly or given to an immunocompromised or pregnant individual ."
should large number of individuals within a population remain unvaccinated then the potential exists for an epidemic to occur .,whether or not to vaccinate is a balance between risks and benefits ; risks to the individual of vaccination are primarily those of a vaccine reaction .
"a crude estimate is that around % of vaccinations result in ' significant ' vaccine reactions , i . e .","what is classified as a vaccine reaction is also unclear , as low - grade malaise of less than hours duration is not uncommon but many would not regard this as a vaccine reaction ."
"vaccines against all these agents are available in the united states , but in the united kingdom the last five are not .","these include vaccines against the following infectious agents : feline parvovirus ( also known as feline infectious enteritis , feline panleukopenia ) ; feline herpes virus - 1 ( feline rhinotracheitis ) ; feline calicivirus ; rabies virus ; chlamydophila felis ( chlamydiosis , chlamydia psittaci ) ; feline leukaemia virus ( felv ) ; bordetella bronchiseptica ; feline coronavirus ( feline infectious peritonitis ) ; burgdorferi ( lyme disease ) ; feline immunodeficiency virus ( fiv ) and tolasma gondii ( tolasmosis ) ."
"few individuals are going to be vaccinated using all potential vaccines , hence it is necessary to decide which vaccines are most suitable for each individual .","likelihood of eure , severity of disease , known risks of the particular vaccine and previous response of the individual to vaccination should be considered ."
"it is also clear that the duration of immunity following some vaccines , for example parvovirus , is considerably longer than one year depending on the vaccine used and the degree of eure in the field .",this has led to the recommendation that boosters should be given every three years to cats ( levy et al .
"for example , a breeding cattery may be free of a particular disease so incoming cats should not have that disease if allowed to enter the cattery .","cats may be screened for infectious disease in a number of situations , particularly when cats are kept in groups ."
"there are few reasons to screen for bacterial disease in cats , unless a particular group is to be kept disease - free , for example a breeding cattery with a bordetella bronchiseptica negative status .",faecal screening for some pathogenic bacteria or protozoa may be indicated in specific instances .
"a variety of other methods such as pcr , virus isolation , western blotting or immunofluoresence testing can be used to detect felv ( herring et al .",") and can be used to confirm a positive elisa result ; alternatively , the screening test can be repeated to weeks later ."
"the main value in knowing the fiv status is for the individual ' s benefit , allowing prompt and aggressive treatment of other infectious disease that may arise in a cat that is immunocompromised due to fiv infection .","cats positive for fiv on screening will often have a long asymptomatic period ( usually to years but longer periods are reported ) before they show signs of illness , and the risk of virus transmission to other individuals in a group is thought to be low ."
"the prognosis for felv positive cats is also more guarded , with more than % likely to die within three years of their positive felv status being detected .","whilst vaccination against felv may help protect felv negative cats from infection , the preventable fraction is significantly less than % ( sparkes ) ( the preventable fraction is the percentage of cats that would be eected to become infected that do not , following vaccination ) ."
"in one survey , where samples to screen for respiratory viruses were taken from apparently healthy cats at a cat show , approximately % of cats less than one year of age were positive for feline calicivirus ( fcv ) .","by comparison , % of the cats were positive for feline herpes virus ( fhv - 1 ) ( coutts et al ."
the existence of carriers of feline parvovirus ( fpv ) has recently been suggested .,such individuals could potentially represent a risk to unvaccinated cats within the group that are immunologically naive .
"ways to reduce the likelihood of eure of cats to pathogens are listed in table , and ways to reduce the likelihood of eure to toxins are listed in table .",disease can be caused by eure to pathogens and to potentially harmful toxins .
"cats may be kept wholly indoors , provided with outside pens , the garden may have a perimeter fence that is cat - proof both from ingress and egress , or the cat may be allowed to roam freely .","for cats kept in large groups , such as in catteries and shelters , the control of infectious disease is a major challenge ; this is discussed further in section ."
there are two major ways that infection is spread : horizontal transmission between cats and vertical transmission between a queen and her kittens in utero .,a carrier of an infectious disease is an animal that does not show clinical signs of the disease but whose body harbours the disease - producing organism and may continue to excrete it .
"recovered cats can become carriers , remaining healthy but continuing to spread infection to susceptible individuals .","infection can be transmitted both in the acute phase , when the cat is obviously unwell , and during the incubation period before it has become ill ."
"disinfection is not , however , a major method of control in such infections .","infectious agents that are spread by direct contact are frequently fragile organisms ; they are easily killed by heat , light , desiccation and disinfectants ."
"following infection with respiratory viruses , approximately % of cats with fhv - 1 are thought to become intermittent carriers and are carriers for the rest of their life .","following fcv infection , % of cats become continuous excretors and are still excreting virus days post - infection ; however , they usually stop excreting after a period of time ."
"in order for hygiene measures to be effective it is essential that all personnel adhere to the disinfection protocols , that the disinfectants used are appropriate ones for the infectious agent and are used at the correct concentration and in the correct manner , and that the disinfectant is safe to use in the environment where cats live .","hygiene plays a crucial role in the control of diseases , in particular those spread by indirect contact ."
"hygiene should encompass the cleaning of the living space of the cat , fomites ( bowls , litter trays , grooming equipment ) and personnel as they move from cat group to cat group .","a number of disinfectants , in particular those containing phenolic compounds , are toxic to cats ( liao & oehme ) ."
it can also affect the severity and duration of the clinical signs .,stress can increase the likelihood of an individual developing clinical signs of infectious disease due to effects on the host immune response .
"while basic methods of disease prevention and control are applicable to all situations , additional approaches will vary depending on the way groups of cats are kept .",they mainly rely on identifying potentially infectious cats and then either preventing them from entering the group or placing them in isolation and quarantine .
it also allows the risk of introducing a new individual to the group to be assessed in terms of the likelihood and consequences of new infection being introduced and the risks to the new individual .,"screening and immunization , together with quarantine and / or isolation of the new arrival , are most appropriate ."
"nevertheless , periodic screening is advisable and vaccination to increase levels of immunity within the group is important .","in most breeding establishments cats are kept indoors or in outdoor pens , so the risk of infection being introduced from cats outside the group is low ."
the disease status of individuals entering a boarding cattery is generally unknown ( even though the cat is usually vaccinated ) and there is a continual movement of new individuals in and out of the cattery .,"disease control has to rely on hygienic management practices and the construction of the premises to minimise disease spread , for example the placing of sneeze barriers between pens ."
"vaccination , where financially practical , should be given to days after arriving when general health and disease status have been evaluated .",long stay cats should be housed separately from short stay cats particular care should be taken to restrict access of any ' shelter cats ' as they are sometimes allowed to roam free and may carry infection into or spread infection around the rescue facility .
"disease control can be achieved by a trapping , neutering and returning policy together with testing for felv and fiv at the time of neutering ( see chapter ) .","surprisingly , stable feral populations are often remarkably free of many infectious diseases ."
"other common conditions requiring veterinary attention include feline lower urinary tract disease , hyperthyroidism and neoplasia ( tumours or tumour - associated diseases ) .","of non - infectious disease , the most commonly reported in surveys of cats attending veterinary surgeries are dental disease , trauma , chronic renal failure ( crf ) and gastrointestinal disease ."
"many practices offer annual health checks that are usually combined with vaccination , so that no specific charge for the health check is made .",the biggest challenge with screening in any population is encouraging presentation of the cat to the clinician to allow screening to be conducted .
"physical examination , as a method of health screening , is a standard assessment of an individual but is relatively insensitive in its ability to diagnose occult disease .","this has led to the use of other methods to minimise risk and detect disease as early as possible , in particular blood tests ( for example prior to anaesthesia ) ."
"if not , it will significantly narrow the field of likely conditions to be considered and help direct further investigation .","depending on the eerience and training of the professional , history taking and physical examination may lead to a diagnosis ."
behaviour - is the cat doing the same things it used to do ?,has there been a change in the amount of attention seeking ?
"in general , aging changes are slowly progressive with no clear start point and should be at a level that is within the eected boundaries for a cat of that age .","in older cats , it can sometimes be very hard to distinguish changes that are associated with the normal aging process from changes indicative of developing disease ."
thorough examination of older cats may well reveal abnormalities that then need to be interpreted according to previous findings and the clinician ' s eerience .,subclinical conditions may be associated with non - specific or normal historical and physical findings .
recognising signs of pain is complicated by the sedative action of many analgesics in veterinary use .,"however , effective pain relief can only be achieved and maintained when the signs of pain are recognised ."
"later in the time course following acute injury , most cats will attempt to hide and show a marked reduction in appetite .","a rapid respiratory rate is not uncommon and appears to be a pain response , as respiratory rate will frequently fall following analgesia ."
"the major clinical decision is not whether to give pain relief but what type of pain relief is most appropriate , and judging how long pain relief is necessary .","following acute trauma the existence of pain is rarely in doubt , unless the cat is not found until some time after the event and external evidence is no longer apparent ."
"localised pain may be seen as abnormalities of posture or prehension , lameness or stiffness or reluctance to perform a specific activity such as jumping .","pain can be difficult to localise , either because the cat fails to react when the focus is palpated or because the cat reacts wherever it is touched or handled ."
"this attitude is changing , and has been associated with a better understanding of pain management in cats and with an increase in the number of women in the profession ( dohoo & dohoo ) .","historically , analgesia has been underused in cats except following major orthopaedic procedures ."
"the use of other drugs which have analgesic activity , such as ketamine and medetomidine , is appropriate in some cases , and the value of local anaesthesia should not be overlooked .","in extreme cases , euthanasia should be considered as a method of relieving intractable pain ."
"however , there remain a large percentage of cats that do not have ready access to veterinary care ; in these cats the effects of disease , especially infectious disease , can be severe .","studies on behaviours associated with pain in cats are needed , in order to develop better methods of identifying acute ( din et al ."
the phylogenetic analysis showed that tgev js2012 was placed between the purdue and the miller clusters .,analysis of recombination confirmed that tgev js2012 is a natural recombinant strain between miller m6 and purdue .
"tgev causes significant economic losses at swine - raising farms ( enjuanes et al . , ; wesley et al . , ) .","there have been many recent reports of tgev infection in china ( hou et al . , ; li et al . , ; zhang et al . , ) ."
"the genome contains nine open reading frames ( orfs ) encoding four traditional coronavirus structural proteins : receptor - binding spike glycoprotein ( s ) ; envelope protein ( e ) ; membrane glycoprotein ( m ) ; nucleocapsid protein ( n ) ; and five nonstructural proteins ( replicase a and b , a , b , and protein ) in the order - replicase polyproteins ( pp1a and pp1ab ) - s - 3 a - 3 b - e - m - n - 7 - 3 ( enjuanes et al . , ) .",the spike ( s ) gene of tgev is about kb in length .
mortality of % in piglets inoculated with isolated tgev js2012 indicated that the strain was highly pathogenic .,genetic analysis showed that js2012 may be a natural recombinant virus and s gene had the genetic characterization of a tgev virulent strain .
"the inoculated cell cultures were observed for cpe for - 5 days , harvested , and blindly passaged for several generations .","after adsorption for min at c , the cells were washed with dmem , and maintenance medium consisting of dmem supplemented with g / ml trypsin was added ."
"supernatants from purified tgev js2012 - infected cell cultures showing cpes were negatively stained with % ammonium molybdate , and examined with an electron microscope ( hitachi h7500 , tokyo , japan ) .","electron microscopy for the detection of tgev particles was carried out as previously described ( fan et al . , b ) ."
"viral rna was extracted from tgev js2012 using trizol ls reagent ( invitrogen , usa ) .","viral cdna was obtained by reverse transcription using prime script reverse transcriptase ( takara , japan ) ."
"the pcr was performed using the prime star gxl dna polymerase kit ( takara , japan ) .",the total genome was divided into segments with - 300 bp overlap between each fragment .
nucleotide sequences were analyzed using the clustal w program by mega version .,the overlapping sequences of the pcr products were combined to obtain the complete genomic sequence of the tgev js2012 strain .
criteria for determining recombination and breakpoints were p < or a recombination score > .,"we used rdp4 software , including rdp , bootscan and siscan , for recombination analysis to detect likely parental isolates and recombination breakpoints under default settings ."
a portion of the jejunum was fixed in % neutral buffered formalin for histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations .,"for each jejunal section , vh / cd ratio was calculated as previously described ( jung et al . , ) ."

"in the variant group , there were major regions of insertion or deletion .",three deletions occurred within orf1a ; deletions occurred between the s and orf3a genes ; deletion occurred in the orf3a gene ; deletion occurred between the orf3a and orf3b genes ; and there was also a single deletion in the m gene ( fig .
ten newborn piglets without colostrum were active and fleshy prior to inoculation and had normal fecal consistency .,"at h after inoculation , the tgev - challenged group had clinical symptoms : eating less , diarrhea and depressed mood ."
"in the present study , tgev js2012 strain was obtained from a farm with a diarrhea outbreak , in which tgev and pedv co - infection was detected by rt - pcr .","in recent years , mixed infections have occurred frequently with tgev and pedv zhang et al . , ; zhu et al . , ) ."
"previous studies have suggested the gene play a potential role in virulence of swine enteric tgev and respiratory coronaviruses ( paul et al . , ) .","however , animal eeriments have shown that js2012 has strong pathogenicity in piglets ."
"this predicted that js2012 retained the genetic characteristics of the tgev virulent strain and integrity of the s gene , and suggested that js2012 was a virulent strain , which was further confirmed by the high pathogenicity in piglets in this study .",there was no deletion or mutation in the s gene of js2012 .
novel approaches reported here utilize the benefits of both methods for the rapid generation of effective immunity .,vaccination is associated with a lag phase before generation of immunity .
"to date , however , no chikv vaccine has been licensed , although a variety of strategies are being evaluated .","importantly , anti - chikv neutralizing antibody titers may be a protective immune correlate ."
"therefore , the development of novel immunotherapeutic / prophylactic modalities that overcome these limitations is warranted .",one such strategy is the in vivo delivery of eression plasmids encoding genes for the immunoglobulin chains of established functional mabs .
this combination approach resulted in both short - and long - term protection from lethal chikv challenge .,this strategy may have implications against chikv and other infectious diseases .
"immunofluorescence analysis was performed as previously described , with slides being visually evaluated by confocal microscopy ( lsm710 ; carl zeiss ) .",the resulting images were semiquantitatively analyzed using zen software ( carl zeiss ) .
all injections were followed immediately by delivery of chikv dmab dna plasmid via electroporation .,"for studies that include the dna vaccine , g of the chikv env plasmid were injected times at - week intervals ."
mouse foot swelling ( height by breadth ) was measured daily up to days after infection .,"two or days after dna delivery , mice were challenged with plaque - forming units ( 25 l ) of the viral isolate chikv del - 03 ( jn578247 ) either subcutaneously ( in the dorsal side of each hind foot ) or intranasally ."
data were generated and statistical analyses performed using the graphpad prism software package ( graph - pad software ) .,nonlinear regression fitting with sigmoidal dose response was used to determine the level of antibody mediating % inhibition of infection ( ic ) .
"sera were collected from mice injected with cvm1 - fab , cvm1 - igg , or chikv env , as well as those challenged with chikv ( 1 week after challenge ) .","tumor necrosis factor ( tnf - ) , interleukin ( il - 1 ) , and interleukin ( il - 6 ) levels in sera were measured using elisa kits according to the manufacturer ' s instructions ( r & d systems ) ."
"a student t test or a nonparametric spearman correlation test were performed using graphpad prism software ( prism , la jolla , california ) .","correlations between the variables in the control and eerimental groups were statistically evaluated using the spearman rank correlation test , with p values of < . 05 considered to be statistically significant for all tests ."
"for the constructs eressing anti - chikv - fab , the vh and vl genes were cloned separately .","the complementary dnas for the coding sequences of the vl and vh immunoglobulin chains for full - length anti - chikv dmab were optimized for increased eression and cloned into a pvax1 vector , using previously described methods ."
"sera collected days after injection from both cvm1 - igg and cvm1 - fab bound to chikv env protein but not to an unrelated control antigen , human immunodeficiency virus type env ( figure d ) .","mice were administered either cvm1 - igg or cvm1 - fab , and sera antibody levels were evaluated through a binding elisa ."
the specificity of in vivo - produced cvm1 - igg antibody was further demonstrated through facs analysis against cells infected with green fluorescent protein - encoded chikv ( figure c ) .,"moreover , cvm1 - fab binding , demonstrated by immunohistochemical analysis and facs analysis , was similar to that of the generated full - length cvm1 - igg ( data not shown ) ."
similar results were observed using sera from cvm1 - fab - injected mice ( data not shown ) .,"these data indicate that antibodies produced in vivo by cvm1 - igg constructs have relevant biological activity ( ie , binding and neutralizing activity against chikv ) ."
each group subsequently was challenged subcutaneously with virus on day to mimic natural chikv infection ( figure a ) .,animal survival and weight changes were subsequently recorded for days .
cvm1 - igg clearly conferred protective immunity more rapidly than the chikv env dna vaccine ( p = . 0026 ) .,"mice that received a single immunization of chikv env or pvax1 died within days of viral challenge , whereas a single immunization of cvm1 - igg provided % protection ( figure a ) ."
"a , an immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that igg generated from cvm1 - igg - administered mice was capable of binding to chikungunya virus ( chikv ) envelope protein ( env ) .","although there is continued eression , these levels are decreased , compared with peak levels , supporting the partial protection noted in the eeriment ( figure b ) ."
"in this eeriment , mice were administered at day a single dose of cvm1 - igg and doses of chikv env dna as described above .","subsequently , half of the animals were challenged with chikv at day and the other half at day ."
"chikv env elicited strong t - cell responses irrespective of codelivery with cvm1 - igg , showing the lack of interference of these approaches .","conversely , animals administered only cvm1 - igg did not develop t - cell responses , as would be eected ."
use of passive antibody therapy has advantages in several high - risk populations that either respond poorly to active vaccination or manifest significant vaccine - related side effects .,it would be a major advantage to generate effective and specific in vivo immunity rapidly without the need for repeated administration of preformed antibodies or a significant lag time for immune response generation that follows conventional antigen - based immunization .
"currently , neither a vaccine nor a therapy for chikv infection has been licensed , but evidence suggests that humoral immunity plays a critical role in protecting against chikv infection .","our group previously demonstrated that passive transfer of sera from mice immunized with a chikv env dna vaccine protected naive mice from lethal chikv challenge , highlighting the utility of antibody - based therapy , as well as prompting interest in developing a novel approach for providing a source of anti - chikv antibodies generated directly in vivo ."
"this study demonstrates that mice injected with a single dose of cvm1 igg were fully protected from viral challenge days after administration , whereas no mice survived infection following a single immunization with chikv env dna vaccine , owing presumably to an insufficient time to mount protective immunity .","however , complete protection was observed with chikv env after a immunization regimen followed by challenge at later time points ."
"the larger is the difference between actual and predicted frequencies , the higher is the chance of mutation occurring .",the effect induced by mutations is to reduce the difference between actual and predicted frequencies .
"naturally we would eect these three sars - cov proteins to have other forms of mutations rather than those documented , and the new mutations would lead to the difficulties in diagnosis and treatment of sars .","so far point mutations have been documented in sars - cov proteins : two in the amino - acid - long membrane glycoprotein , three in the amino - acid - long spike glycoprotein and ten in the amino - acid - long replicase polyprotein [ 2 , , , ] ."
an intriguing question is whether or not we can predict the new mutations of sars - cov .,"if so , it would be greatly helpful for identification of sars - cov , and a great advance in understanding of the evolutionary process in sars - cov ."
"still at present it is only the spike glycoprotein , in which a considerable amount of mutations has been documented .","using the blastp program to align three spike glycoproteins from humans , we find little cue on the likelihood of which amino acid would mutate in sars spike glycoprotein ."
"in this study , we use our model to analyze two spike glycoproteins from human coronavirus in order to gain the insight on the prediction of amino acid pairs being sensitive to mutations in human sars - cov .","our studies show there is a clearly probabilistic pattern in the amino acids , which are subject to mutations ."
"in order to determine the amino acid pairs probabilistically sensitive to mutations , we conduct the following calculations , which is briefly described follows with the sars - cov spike protein as the example .","the access number is p59594 for human sars - cov with point mutations , p15423 for human coronavirus strain e with point mutations , , and p36334 for human coronavirus strain oc43 with point mutations ."
"the first and second amino acids are considered as an amino acid pair , the second and third as another pair , the third and fourth , until the th and th , thus there are pairs .","because there are types of amino acids , an amino acid pair can be composed from any of types of amino acids so there are types of theoretically possible amino acid pairs ."
"actually we can find three "" rs "" s in the spike protein , so the actual frequency of "" rs "" is .","hence , we have three relationships between actual and predicted frequencies , i . e ."
"as each pair has its actual and predicted frequencies , the difference between them represents a probabilistic measure for the comparison in substituted and substituting amino acid pairs before and after mutation .","after calculating the predicted frequency and comparing with the actual frequency , we can classify the substituted amino acid pairs into the predictable / unpredictable amino acid pairs ."
"although this study shows that the mutations in the spike proteins from strains e and oc43 go along the direction of degeneration , i . e .","as such a pathway is less energy - and time - consuming , in fact , the mutations represent a process of degeneration inducing human diseases ."
"moreover we notice that table amino acid pairs being more likely to be targeted by mutation in the spike protein from human sars - cov difference between actual and predicted frequencies the positions of "" fn "" s overlap with "" nf "" s at positions from to , at which the highly possible mutations would be more likely to occur .","this hypothesis can be supported by the mutations found in other proteins , such as human collagen ( iv ) chain precursor , p53 protein and so on ."
many adult patients hospitalised with acute respiratory illness have viruses detected but the overall importance of viral infection compared to bacterial infection is unclear .,methods : patients were recruited from two acute hospital sites in leicester ( uk ) over successive winters .
adults hospitalised with acute respiratory illness rarely have detectable bacteria in the absence of copd or pneumonia ; viral infection predominates in a large prospective uk sample introduction acute respiratory illness is responsible for a large proportion of acute hospital admissions in adults .,"it is accepted that respiratory viruses are responsible for the majority of acute respiratory illness in infants and children , including those admitted to secondary care ."
all patients had a chest radiograph performed within h of admission .,"individual clinical groups were identified by discharge icd - 10 ( international classification of disease , tenth edition ) code classification and confirmed by case note review ."
"blood cultures were incubated aerobically and anaerobically using the bact / alert d blood culture system ( biomerieux , durham , north carolina , usa ) .","standard microbiological testing blood , urine , sputum and nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected at enrolment ."
"although all patients had nasopharyngeal swabs tested for viruses and the vast majority of patients had blood cultures and pneumococcal antigen testing performed , only / 780 ( 42% ) were able to produce sputum samples for culture .","we therefore performed a separate analysis of only those patients with complete sampling for bacteria ( sputum culture , blood culture , pneumococcal antigen testing ) ."
antibiotics were given in % ( 98 / 165 ) of patients with exacerbation of asthma and % ( 22 / 165 ) received iv antibiotics .,% ( 235 / 299 ) of patients with exacerbation of copd received antibiotics and % ( 67 / 299 ) received iv antibiotics .
only % ( 125 of ) of all antibiotic use occurred in patients with bacteria detected e either alone ( 11% ) or concurrently with a virus ( 10% ) .,% ( 247 / 351 ) of patients with no pathogen detected received antibiotics representing % ( 247 / 582 ) of all antibiotic use .
"in addition to triggering exacerbations of asthma and copd , 5 and causing lower respiratory tract illness in community - dwelling elderly this work suggests that picornaviruses are important in a large proportion of adult hospitalisations with acute respiratory illness .","this study shows that bacterial detection is relatively frequent in patients with exacerbation of copd and pneumonia ( where mixed detection of bacteria and viruses is also common ) compared to all other clinical groups , where detection of bacteria is rare ."
"however , definitely excluding a concurrent bacterial infection in these patients who are often severely unwell is difficult to achieve in practice and so strategies to reduce antibiotic use in hospitalised patients with pneumonia are unlikely to be appropriate or successful .",", primary viral pneumonia occurs in nonimmunocompromised adults with influenza virus infection and may also occur with other respiratory viruses ."
studies using the serum biomarker procalcitonin ( pct ) have demonstrated that antibiotics can be safely withheld in patients with exacerbation of copd and low levels of pct .,biomarker directed antibiotic use probably represent the most promising strategy currently available for reducing excess antibiotic use in this group and studies further evaluating this are ongoing .
influenza virus was detected in over % of all asthma exacerbations in our study and it is notable that asthma was a risk factor for hospital admission with laboratory confirmed influenza during the recent ( h1n1 ) pandemic .,in our cohort bacterial detection in patients with exacerbation of asthma was unusual .
a large study from the us demonstrated that rsv and influenza viruses were both associated with a significant proportion of hospitalisations with congestive heart failure .,in our study around one third of patients admitted with decompensated heart failure had a respiratory virus detected with bacteria being detected infrequently and antibiotics being used in the majority .
a recent randomised placebo controlled trial of antibiotics for acute bronchitis ( in patients without chronic lung disease ) demonstrated no benefit from antibiotics and a trend towards harm in those over aged years .,a cochrane review has concluded that there is limited if any evidence for the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis and has discouraged their use in this group .
"in summary this study demonstrates the predominance of respiratory viruses in adults hospitalised with acute respiratory illness and shows that excess antibiotic use occurs in clinical groups where viral detection is common , bacterial detection is rare and there is a lack of evidence for clinical benefit from antibiotics .",efforts at reducing excess antibiotic use in hospitals should focus in these groups as a priority .

the proliferation rates of the cell lines with silenced cyp40 were decreased compared to the control cells .,"in this study , we created keratinocyte cell lines with cyp40 being stably knocked down using viral particles containing shrna for cyp40 which knocked down the eression level of cyp40 transcripts by to %."
"cyps are highly conserved among all types of species including animals , plants , fungi and bacteria with a shared isomerase domain of approximately amino acids .",cyclophilin proteins ( cyps ) are ubiquitous proteins with peptidyl - prolyl cis - trans isomerase activity .
encoded by the ppid gene which is also referred to in some literature as cyclophilin d ( cypd ) .,"there exists some confusion in the nomenclature whereby an additional cyp member is also referred to as cyclophilin d , which is the kd mitochondrial protein involved in mptp regulation ."
"the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore causes a collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential , leading to atp depletion and cell death , depending on the rate of atp consumption .","the mptp starts its formation in response to conditions of cellular stress including mitochondrial calcium overload , oxidative stress , elevated phosphate concentration and adenine depletion and the consequence of this process for the cell is mptp fluxing ."
all target an identical site within hsp90 through this conserved c - terminal region to form separate steroid receptor complexes containing hsp90 associated with a single cytosolic immunophilin .,"these three large immunophilins ( cyp40 , fkbp51 , fkbp52 ) are characterized by an n - terminal immunophilin - like domain together with a conserved c - terminal tetratricopeptide repeat ( tpr ) domain that provides an interface for protein interaction ."
thus replacing the his141 ( in cyp40 ) by trp ( in cypd ) is likely to be critical for determining binding affinity to csa .,site - directed mutagenesis to replace his141 by trp yielded a protein with an approximately - fold greater affinity for cyclosporin a .
"apoptosis can be induced by various factors of biological , chemical and physical origin .",one of the well known physical agents triggering apoptotic processes in cells is uv light which directly damages dna and leads to high ros production .
"however , there are only very limited data available on the role of cytosolic cyp40 in apoptosis generally and no reports about its role in uva - induced apoptosis specifically .",there is a support for mitochondrial cypd role in uva - induced apoptosis and cell death processes as well as a large amount of evidence that uva light is responsible for cellular apoptosis mediated through the stimulation of ros production .
"transfected hacat cells were incubated in dmem media supplemented with ug / ml puromycin ( sigma - aldrich , saint louis , mo ) .","hacat cells of keratinocyte origin were cultured in dmem medium ( invitrogen , san diego , ca ) supplemented with % fbs ( hyclone , logan , ut ) and penicillin / streptomycin ( 50 g / ml ) ( invitrogen , san diego , ca ) ."
"as a control , an empty plko . 1 vector was used to transfect the hacat cells .","all resulting ppid - 6 , ppid - 7 and control cells were selected from a single cell colony for each particular construct and puromycin was used as a selective agent since the plko . 1 vector contains the region for resistance to puromycin ."
"total rna was isolated using qiagen rneasy mini kit ( qiagen sciences , gaithersburg , md ) according to the manufacturer ' s protocol .","the rna integrity was checked by the rna nano chip kit using agilent bioanalyzer ( agilent technologies , santa clara , ca ) ."

"in parallel eeriments , cells were loaded with calcein - am alone or calcein - am and cocl or calcein - am , cocl and ionomycin and incubated for minutes at c .","cells were centrifuged , washed , and cell pellets were resuspended in ml of dpbs and analyzed for mitochondrial calcein fluorescence by flow cytometry analysis ."
control cells were seeded at a concentration of cells per well while the ppid - 6 and ppid - 7 cells at a concentration of cells per well in - well plates .,"mitosox red mitochondrial superoxide indicator ( invitrogen , san diego , ca ) was used to detect superoxide , as a general measure of cellular oxidative stress in the mitochondria of live cells ."

these two cell lines showed the same behavioral characteristics in all assays that were further performed .,there were no significant differences in eression levels of cyp40 between the control cell line transfected with empty vector and the parental untransfected hacat cells ( data not shown ) .
control cell lines that were transfected with empty vector had the same proliferation rate as untransfected parental hacat cells ( data not shown ) .,"when the numbers of dead cells were counted , no differences between the cells transected with cyp40 and control cells transfected with empty vector were found , highlighting that the effect seen in cyp40 silenced cells was one of diminished cellular proliferation rather than enhanced death ."
flow cytometry analysis revealed % viability in nonirradiated control cell samples and almost the same % viability in both ppid - 6 and ppid - 7 samples .,pi was used to stain cells with altered membrane integrity which is typical for cells in the later stages of apoptosis or necrosis .
depolarized or inactive mitochondria have decreased membrane potential and fail to sequester tmre .,fccp ( a mitochondrial uncoupler ) depolarizes mitochondrial membrane completely and thus serves as a positive control .
"once inside cells , intracellular esterases cleave the acetoxymethyl esters to liberate the very polar fluorescent dye calcein , which does not cross the mitochondrial or plasma membranes .","in order to assess mptp activity , we measured calcein fluorescence accumulated in the mitochondria by quenching cytosolic calcein with cobalt chloride ( cocl ) ."
our results showed significantly lower levels of mitochondrial superoxide after uva irradiation in ppid - 6 and ppid - 7 cell lines than it was found in control cells .,"on the other hand , in non - irradiated samples there were observed slightly lower superoxide levels in ppid - 6 and ppid - 7 cells compared to control cells ( figure a ) ."
"moreover , there was observed % inhibition in eression of mitochondrial kda cypd / ppif gene in cells with altered cyp40 levels that were either eed to uva or not .","the eression levels of ant2 and ant3 were decreased in non uva eed cyp40 knocked down cells by % and %, respectively while there was seen significant decrease of % in ant2 eression and % in ant3 eression levels in these cells eed to uva irradiation ."
"our results showed an effect of cyp40 knock down on processes including the uva - induced apoptosis , mitochondrial membrane potential , activity of mitochondrial pore along with the mrna eression levels of its components , and ros generation .","in this study , we examined the consequences of altered eression of cytosolic kda cyp40 on mitochondrial functions of human keratinocytes ."
we used two individual cyp40 shrna constructs for stable transfection resulting in two cell lines named ppid - 6 and ppid - 7 .,we generated two hacat keratinocyte cell lines with stable cyp40 knocked down by transfecting parental hacat cells with viral particles containing shrna against cyp40 gene .
both eeriments revealed that mitochondrial response to uva irradiation is lower in cyp40 knocked cells than in control cells by showing significantly more stable mmp and less active mptp what correlates with lower apoptosis in these cells .,we also tested the response of mmp as well as mptp opening in response to uva eure .
"thus , our data show that diminished levels of cyp40 eression are associated with increased resistance to uva - induced apoptosis .","in conclusion , in our study we show for the first time that silencing of cytosolic kda cyp40 causes a protective effect against uva - induced apoptosis in human keratinocytes and this is most likely produced through an alteration of mitochondrial function and specifically mitochondrial ros ."
"as a corollary , therapeutic strategies to increase cyp40 levels in cutaneous malignancies may allow for uva to be used as a paired therapeutic modality to treat skin cancers with depths that are penetrable by irradiation with uva .","medications such as csa that inhibit the activity of cyp40 , or other therapies that have the result of lowering cyp40 levels may have an undesirable effect in the skin of promoting tumors or by generating populations of cells that are resistant to therapeutic strategies such as photodynamic therapy or photochemo - therapy that are designed to induce apoptosis in tumor cells ."
the optical signals showed that this nanoparticle - based immunoassay with dynamic mixing could successfully achieve a detection limit of influenza as low as 07 hau .,"furthermore , the mixing index of the micromixer could achieve as high as % in seconds ."
"furthermore , the influenza virus , which causes the flu , caused several historic pandemics ; for instance , the spanish flu of claimed million lives worldwide .","people infected with norovirus can develop acute gastroenteritis and become ill with influenza , causing sudden fever and whole - body achiness , as well as lung and heart diseases ."
"recently , with the development of micro - electro - mechanical systems ( mems ) technologies , an increasing number of miniature biomedical systems have demonstrated the potential for virus detection .","for instance , a nano - cantilever beam operating as a mass detector was developed for the detection of viral particle ; this type of microsystem was further used for virus - specific antibodies to selectively detect pathogens ."
using beads with smaller sizes and larger surface area may be beneficial for target detection .,the incomparable size between beads and viruses can affect the detection signal and cause relatively high background noise .
"in this study , it is the first attempt to apply nanoparticles , by using an integrated microfluidic system that involves characterized micro - devices working with magnetic mnfe o nanoparticles for influenza detection with a fia .","by using this approach , the detection limit of the diagnosis is eected to improve because of the large surface - to - volume ratio of nanoparticles ."
"finally , an optical detection module was used to detect the optical signal of the purified nanoparticle - virus - developing mabs complexes ( figure , d ) .",the non - binding interferences were washed away and the purification of the nanoparticlevirus - developing mab complexes with the similar process .
"figure , c shows a photograph of the chip with dimensions measured to be mm mm .","a schematic illustration of the developed microfluidic chip composed of washing buffer chambers , - a - np - pe mabs chambers , micropumps , normally closed microvalves , and micromixers for performing the entire diagnosis process is shown in figure , b , which consisted of eight reaction units and could test eight samples in one chip ."
", therefore , the micromixer was modified into a circular shape to reduce the adsorption of the magnetic nanoparticles .","the original incubation chambers contained microfluidic side channels , where nanoparticles might adsorb along the edges with the dead - volume regions ."
this sequence of surface modification was repeated twice to obtain the desired thickness of polyelectrolyte multilayers and the native hydrophobic pdms surface could be surface - modified to hydrophilic .,"thirdly , the pdms surface was coated with a pei solution ( mw , 000 , 5% [ wt / vol ] , in di water ) for min ."
the size of the synthesized nanoparticles can be fine - tuned to an average size of nm with this approach .,", a series of transmission electron microscope ( tem ) images of the magnetic mnfe o nanoparticles are shown in figure ."
the crystalline structures were further identified using an x - ray diffractometer ( xrd ) analysis with nanoparticles preserved for three months .,"to confirm the stability of these nanoparticles , these products were tested under tem and uv - vis spectrum analysis ."
they were diluted with a c pbs buffer to form various viral concentrations ranging from : 128 with a dilution (8 hau / 50 l ) to : 128 with a dilution ( 0.007 hau / 50 l ) .,the pbs buffer was used as negative control ( nc ) for background noise testing .
the fluorescence decay analysis of nanoparticle in pe was shown in si section viii .,"subsequently , the emitted signals from the pe dye were passed through a dichroic mirror ( 565 - nm cut - off wavelength , nikon , japan ) and other signals were filtered by using a barrier filter ( 590 - nm long - pass [ lp ] , nikon , japan ) ."
"the detailed information regarding the calculation of mixing index could be found in the si section v . the optimization of the micromixer was also elored by measuring the mixing index at different driving frequencies ( 0.5 , , , and hz , respectively ) under an applied gauge pressure of kpa and psi .","in the unmixed state , c + shows significant difference from low to high ink concentration ; after mixing , c + value is the same for all area within the mixing chamber ."
"importantly , non - specific adsorption of the nanoparticles was elored for the cases before and after the surface modification .","figures , e - 1 to e - 6 clearly show that non - specific adsorption of mnfe o nanoparticles was evident on the non - modified surface , but became substantially reduced on the p123 / paa / pei - modified surface ( figure , e - 6 ) ."
note that the entire process can be performed within min .,"compared with a pbs buffer as a negative control ( nc ) ( figures , a - g ) , the optical signals for the detection of influenza virus in the microfluidic system with different viral concentrations were shown ."
"however , further comparisons with jcpds patterns of - 1964 , - 2403 , - 0034 , and - 1965 showed other xrd patterns of mnfe o with slight differences in the formation ratios of mn and fe .","compared with the standard mnfe o pattern of jcpds , non - typical peaks were detected at , , and ."
effective focusing and collection are the next concerns for applying dynamically mixed nanoparticles and combining dielectrophoresis ; otherwise the ac electro - osmosis force may provide the additional force for nanoparticle collection .,", in addition , a well - designed customer - made control system , which was composed of a temperature control module , an air compressor , several emvs , and an optical detection module , might also reduce optical signal loss and automatically perform the entire diagnostic process ."
"by using this approach and combining with lbl surface modification , the lod of the on - chip diagnoses was improved to be as low as 07 hau .",this study is the first attempt to demonstrate an integrated microfluidic system that involves using dynamically mixed magnetic mnfe o nanoparticles to detect the influenza infection with fia .
"from a macroeconomic point of view , the property sector is an aspect of paramount importance of the holistic performance of economy .","in fact , over the past few decades the real estate industry has been a target of government fiscal and monetary policies aimed at achieving balanced economic growth , low inflation , and low unemployment ."
"however , meen argues that there is no stable relationship between house prices and rents or between house prices and income .","for examples ) , because it seems reasonable to cite the currently low level of the rent - price ratio as a sign that we are in a housing price bubble ."
"according to yuen and chu , the bubble detection methodologies can be divided into two generations .","there has been a long tradition of studying the theory and models of price bubbles in the general stock markets , and these models are also utilized to detect bubbles in the property markets ."
"more recently , hui and shen incorporate econometrical methodologies into a reduced form equations structure to study housing price bubbles in shanghai and beijing .","taipalus develops a rolling sub - sample augmented dickey fuller ( adf ) indicator to test log rent - price ratio for the existence of real estate bubbles for finland , usa , uk , spain and germany , and the results suggest bubbles exist in nearly all of these countries ."
the difficulty of accepting a bubble lies in the specification of the underlying fundamental economic models .,as flood and garber argue that any bubble detected suffers from the problem of model mis - specification or regime switch processing without any universally accepted fundamental model .
the parameters ( i ; t i ) and p ( i ; t i ) are uniquely determined from the past t i data points by the condition that minimizes the root - mean - square of f ( t ) .,"in this formula , p ( t ) is the price at time t and f ( t ) is the residual noise term ."
"after t i are obtained for each point , we introduce the following formula defining bubbles and crashes , adding p ( t ) into the autoregressive model .","by repeating for each point at time t , ( i ; t i ) is obtained for different t i diversified from to , which means that the time scale t i used is dynamic and determined by historical data ."
p ( t ) is the price at time t and f ( t ) is the residual noise term .,"the parameters ( i ; t i ) , ( i ; t i ) and p ( i ; t i ) are uniquely determined from the past t i data points by the condition that minimizes the root - mean - square of f ( t ) ."
"the gpr index is available on a daily basis , and is divided into various sub - indices .","the standard gpr reit index is calculated in three currencies : local , euro and us dollar , and we use the us dollar currency in this paper ."

one stillborn male calf with atresia coli after days of gestation from a cow the present investigation was presented to the,"the number of fetuses aborted late , premature , and mature dead from fms , asp , and con groups was , , and , respectively ( p 5 ) , and no abnormalities at necropsy were detected ."
"the number of fetuses aborted late , premature , and mature dead from fms , asp , and con groups was , , and , respectively ( p 5 ) , and no abnormalities at necropsy were detected .","the calving rate two for the same groups was % ( 204 / 239 ) , % ( 197 / 239 ) , and % ( 207 / 236 ) , respectively ( p 7 ) ."
"to accomplish this purpose , cows must become pregnant within to days after calving .",two capital phases in dairy reproductive management are not only breeding cows after the voluntary waiting period but also having an early pregnancy diagnosis .
per rectum palpation continues to be the most used technique for pregnancy diagnosis for practitioners .,"the use of prp is based on multiple reasons such as not requiring equipment or laboratory and the fact that the results are fast , permitting an immediate decision ."
"moreover , no evidence was published about the use of allantochorion membrane detection on calving rates or abnormalities in newborn calves .","however , to the best of the authors ' knowledge , no controlled studies were available with the initial pregnancy diagnosis by asp performed during the early fetal period ( ! 46 - 60 days ) on prl , calving rates , and abnormalities in newborn calves ."
"eight hundred lactating pregnant cows from the cold water dairy farm from strafford , tx , usa , were included .",the study was performed in compliance with established standard operating procedures and guidelines for animal care and use of texas a & m university .
all the initial pregnancy diagnoses were performed only once by a board - certified theriogenologist with over years of bovine practice .,"in the event that one amniotic sac was found , no attempt was made to look for a second amniotic vesicle ; therefore , the possibility of twin pregnancy detection was avoided ."
calving rate one was the percentage between the number of females that calved and the initial number of pregnant females .,calving rate two was the percentage between the number of cows that calved and the number of pregnant cows at reexamination .
"the overall late prl rate between reexamination ( from the embryonic period plus early fetal evaluation ; days - 57 ) and calving for fms , asp , and con groups was % ( 9 / 213 ) , % ( 12 / 209 ) , and % ( 9 / 216 ) , respectively ( p 1 ) .",the late prl rate from all groups between cows pregnant at reexamination and calving from all the groups that were from the embryonic period ( 4.1% ) to the early fetal period ( 5.5% ) was not different ( p 1 ) .
"in a later study , a prl of % between pregnancy diagnoses by asp performed between days and and calving was described .","in regard to fms , in multiple noncontrolled studies , the procedure was shown to be deleterious for the conceptus ."
"it is difficult to interpret how fms produced the highest prl compared with asp , which required more manipulation of the uterus and skill to detect the amniotic sac .","in a former investigation that compared three techniques of pregnancy diagnosis , fluctuation , allantochorion detection , and amniotic sac detection by prp , it was concluded that allantochorion membrane detection increased significantly the prl compared with the other two procedures ."
"on the other hand , nonpregnancy is a static condition that needs assessment to place the female as soon as possible in the reproductive program .","prl varied among farms ; therefore , different policies of pregnancy diagnosis and reexamination need to be established for each dairy operation ."
that means that only one veterinarian performs one examination looking for only one positive sign of pregnancy .,"this fact could be judged as a limited factor ; however , this person has the eerience and credentials to be considered as a regular bovine practitioner ."
"therefore , the present eeriment not only agreed with this last study but also extends knowledge that the use of fms for pregnancy diagnosis affected neither the late prl nor calving rates .",the present outcomes are in concordance with a recent investigation in which asp was used only during the late embryonic period and compared with a concurrent con group of pregnant females throughout the gestation with no differences in calving rates detected .
the presence of a contemporaneous cluster of pregnant females of the same age of gestation that did not undergo prp for comparison permitted differentiation between the spontaneous prl in the con group from the potential effects of the technique by prp for pregnancy diagnosis groups .,containing an adequate concurrent con group of comparison to arrive at sound conclusions .
"this outcome is in agreement with the findings of a recent study in which asp was performed in pregnant cows during the late embryonic period ( days ) ; of these , were between days and .","however , no calves with atresia coli were detected in cows evaluated ."
"in a different study , from the same herd , one calf with atresia coli ( 0.34% ) was detected from normal calves diagnosed from a contemporaneous random mating group .",the present outcomes were in conformity with other reports that pregnancy diagnosis performed after day corresponded to normal calves and one affected calf ( 0.3% ) or a mean prevalence of 6% from a holstein herd that reported cases of atresia coli from births ( from - 1983 ; range between years from % - 1.55% / y ) .
"the present findings support the use of either asp or fms for pregnancy diagnosis , when performed by a trained veterinarian in a random dairy cattle population , was a safe procedure for the conceptus using three assessment points : at reexamination , at calving , and at evaluation of newborn calves .","some authors stated previous recommendations avoiding prp of the uterus to detect the amniotic sac during the first days of gestation [ 33 , , ] ."
"recently , hfmd associated with coackievirus a6 and a10 ( cva6 and cva10 ) also emerged ( aswathyraj et al . , ) .","in china , eva71 caused a severe hfmd outbreak in , and hfmd has since become epidemic ( zhang et al . , ) ."

"based on their functions , cofactors are divided into three major classes : ( i ) substrate - recruiting cofactors like uba - ubx proteins and ufd1 - npl4 which bring substrates to vcp ; ( ii ) substrate processing cofactors like ubiquitin ( e3 ) ligases , deubiquitinases ( dubs ) and peptide n - glycanase ( pngase ) ; ( iii ) regulatory cofactors like ubx proteins ub4 and aspl as well as svip ( hanzelmann and schindelin , ) .","the activity of vcp is tightly controlled by various regulatory cofactors , which either associate with the n - terminal domain or interact with the c - terminus via distinct binding motifs and target vcp to specific cellular pathways ( hanzelmann and schindelin , ) ."
"moreover , ufd1 regulates the viral co - receptor j o u r n a l p r e - p r o o f nucleolin eression since knockdown of ufd1 significantly reduces the eression of nucleolin , leading to decreased binding of eva71 to host cells .","thus , our study reveals novel mechanisms of vcp and its cofactors to facilitate enterovirus infection ."

"the inoculum was then removed , and cells were washed three times with pbs and then covered with % agar medium .","after days of incubation , the cells were fixed and stained with % crystal violet and plaques were counted ."
the pseudotyped viruses were produced by sequential transfection of capsid plasmid and replicon rna into hek293t cells as described previously .,the replicon rnas of eva71 - luc or eva71 - egfp were obtained from the linearized plasmid by in vitro transcription .

we treated rd cells with various concentration of nms - 873 and assessed the viral replication by monitoring the intracellular level of viral capsid protein vp - 1 .,"to elore the role of vcp in eva71 replication cycle , we first used nms - 873 , a pharmacological inhibitor of vcp ( magnaghi et al . , ) to assess its effect on viral replication ."
"its extended ubx domain - containing fragment ( residues - 553 , termed aspl - c ) , is critical for the interaction with vcp , while its j o u r n a l p r e - p r o o f mutant ( two proline amino acids of residues - 438 were replaced by two alanine amino acids , termed aspl - c pp437 - 4 3 8 aa ) loses the binding for vcp ( arumughan et al . , ) .","alveolar soft part sarcoma locus ( aspl ) , a cofactor of vcp with high - affinity , is reported to promote vcp hexamer disassembly and disrupt the d2 atpase activity of vcp ( arumughan et al . , ) ."
"since ufd1 interference showed the most consistent and the largest suppressing effect , we subsequently focused on the role of ufd1 in virus infection .","to exclude the off - target effects of sirna against ufd1 , we examined three sirna oligosaccharides and two previously reported oligosaccharides showing strong suppressing effects individually ."
"we found that early inhibition of vcp led to more viral inhibition shown by less vp - 1 levels , eva71 rna and viral yields , indicating the involvement of vcp in early steps of viral infection ( fig .","to further study how vcp and ufd1 interact with the enterovirus life cycle , we performed the time of addition assay testing the vcp inhibitor ( nms - 873 ) ."
"to elore the involvement of vcp and ufd1 in different stages during enterovirus life cycle , their roles in viral replications were examined in enterovirus replicon rnas transfection assays , while their roles in pre - entry steps were examined using the eva71 pseudoviral particles which only caused single round of infection .","in both assays , the viral replication and infectivity could be easily monitored by luciferase activity or egfp eression ( chen et al . , ) ."
"to confirm this , we utilized the tcr - gfp overeressing rd cells in which overeressed tcr was degraded by erad , and disruption of erad led to tcr accumulation .","however , our data showed that ufd1 was involved in eva71 infection and npl4 was not , suggesting the mechanism may not be related to erad ."
"we found that knockdown of vcp or ufd1 significantly decreased the binding and uptake of eva71 to rd cells , but knockdown of npl4 did not ( fig .","next , we investigated whether ufd1 participated in viral binding and cellular uptake during the early stages of viral life cycle ."
"therefore , we hypothesized whether ufd1 affected the eression of enterovirus receptors .","it is uneected to find that ufd1 , an intracellular protein , affects the enterovirus binding to host cells ."
these studies suggested that vcp may participate in various steps of viral life cycle .,"in this study , we confirmed that vcp functioned at both the early and later stages of eva71 life cycle , including enterovirus entry , genome replication and likely virion release ."
"however , knockdown of npl4 failed to affect eva71 infection , so the role of ufd1 and vcp in eva71 infection is independent of npl4 or erad .","furthermore , we also found similar roles of vcp and ufd1 in facilitating infection of other enteroviruses , such as cva16 , cav6 and cva10 , whereas knockdown of npl4 did not affect viral infections ."
"these data indicate that ufd1 likely acts as an upstream regulator for nucleolin , a coreceptor for eva71 .",we further showed the matching effects of ufd1 and nucleolin knockdown in infections by different enterovirus species .
revealing the exact mechanism of how vcp - ufd1 regulates nucleolin may reveal potential intervention targets for those enteroviruses .,these data increase our understanding of the specific pre - entry regulatory process of enterovirus a .
"in the screening of cofactors , we identified that ubxn6 and sprtn knockdown also had inhibitory effects on eva71 infection .","it has been reported that sprtn is a regulator of uv - induced dna damage response and promote ubiquitination of pcna and synthesis of translesion dna synthesis ( machida et al . , ) ."

"however , these questions may never be answered because we hope that there will never be another patient with classical smallpox , and the best nonhuman primate model does not perfectly reproduce clinical smallpox .","despite this impressive progress , clinicians have been left with several unanswered questions ."
"if therapeutic interventions were available that could assist the immune system during infection with smallpox virus , the case - fatality rate in pregnant women might be reduced considerably .","we now know that a normal pregnancy includes a modest transient immune defi cit , particularly suppression of th1 and tc cells ."
"we cannot say with confi dence that ocular variola was considerably more common in areas where trachoma or vitamin a defi ciency was rare because rates of this devastating complication are not well documented in europe and the united states ; however , ocular variola certainly occurred .","if trachoma is a predisposing condition , ocular variola may be rare in western industrialized nations if smallpox reappears ."
"if the mechanism is predominately poor blood fl ow secondary to an arteritis , an antiviral drug might not eliminate it .",direct injection of an antiviral drug into the joint spaces might be useful if we could agree on clinical indicators of joint infection that would induce such a therapeutic approach .
the dynamics of development of humoral and cellular immunity after vaccination also suggest that vaccination within days after eure would be successful .,analysis of old data from the united kingdom showed that good protection resulted from posteure vaccination .
st - 246 seems to be an effective antiviral drug .,preliminary animal data and limited human data suggest that giving st - 246 with vaccination greatly reduces the clinical manifestations of vaccinia but does not impede development of cellular or humoral immunity .
"the fi rst consideration is the use of therapies that may , although unproven , be of considerable value in reducing the case - fatality rate .","these therapies include newly developed antiviral drugs , pressor therapy for shock , treatment for dic , and efforts to control the cytokine cascade ."
their immune conditions may make vaccination diffi cult or dangerous if they are eed to smallpox virus .,these patients might become severely ill if eed to smallpox virus .
"it might be better to bring medical care to patients in a remote location ( e . g . , motel or defunct hospital ) than to risk spread of the disease in a hospital .",evidence has shown that protocols for isolation of patients with fever and an undiagnosed rash are not rigidly followed in many general hospitals .
"orthopoxviruses are large , stable , dna viruses that are fairly easy to manipulate genetically .",technologies needed for creating live poxviruses from a variety of genetic fragments are readily available .
researchers working with mousepox virus have created a recombinant virus capable of escaping the effects of prior immunization with vaccinia virus .,the soviet union allegedly inserted genes from other pathogens into variola major virus .
"although most western nations have mechanisms for controlling smallpox outbreaks , most third - world nations do not .","the eerience with severe acute respiratory syndrome showed that even in the absence of a vaccine or antimicrobial drug , diseases spread by respiratory secretions can be controlled by vigorous identifi cation and isolation of patients ."
second - generation vaccines can be diluted : 10 and still give excellent results .,"it produces reactions and immune responses similar to those of fi rst - generation dryvax vaccine ( wyeth laboratories , new york , ny , usa ) ."
"because mva does not produce a visible lesion or scar , rapid determination of who has been already vaccinated is diffi cult .",first - generation and second - generation vaccines are lyophilized and can be reconstituted and administered in the fi eld with bifurcated needle scarifi cation by persons with minimal training .
"in an actual outbreak , acam2000 should be used for fi eld vaccination .","given these limitations , third - generation vaccines may be best for persons who anticipate possible eure , such as military personnel or laboratory personnel working with orthopoxviruses ."
"in that situation , we might respond by using fi rst - generation and second - generation vaccines with proven effi cacies .",widespread use of fi rst - generation or second - generation smallpox vaccines in era of aids and iatrogenic immune suppression by cancer chemotherapy or for transplant surgery seems unlikely unless there are actual cases of smallpox .
the us institute of medicine has issued a report that outlines robust scientifi c arguments for retaining the stocks of live virus .,modern viral genetics may have rendered destruction of the offi cial remaining stores of the virus moot because the virus can be recreated with minimal technical diffi culty ( vide supra ) .
terrorists or rogue states that have other weapons of mass destruction might see our possession of smallpox virus as a justifi cation for their own development of a bioterrorist arsenal .,"if known offi cial stocks are destroyed , then we will know that any new cases of smallpox are the result of deliberate maligning activities ."
the resulting n - propargylated oxindoles are then converted to triazoles using coppercatalyzed azide - alkyne cycloaddition ( cuaac ) reactions .,"overall , this strategy affords a member pilot - scale library of diverse oxindoles and spirooxindoles ."
"for example , isatin is a potent inhibitor of sars cov c - like proteases .","substituted isatin ( indole - 2,3 - diones ) scaffolds have also shown promising examples of biological activity ."
the efficient stereoselective syntheses of complex heterocycles combining both oxindole and triazole motifs have not been described previously .,"based on the breadth of biological activity known for isatins , oxindoles and spirooxindoles , these densely functionalized heterocycles should serve as important biological probes for chemical biology ."
"based on the nucleophile component utilized ( scheme ) , four oxindole scaffolds were selected for this library : hydroxyoxindoles - 15 are prepared enantioselectively using a chiral lewis acid catalyst ; b spiroindolones are prepared enantioselectively using a chiral br nsted acid catalyst ; c and the - oxazoline and - oxazoline spirocycles and are each prepared diastereo - and regioselectively using a titanium ( iv ) lewis acid catalyst ( scheme ) .","a key feature in this strategy is the regio - , diastereo - and enantioselective synthesis of the oxindole and spirooxindole scaffolds ( scheme ) ."
"using ( s ) - 3,3 - bis ( 2,4 , 6 triisopropylphenyl ) - 1,1 - binaphthyl - 2,2 - diyl hydrogenphosphate as the catalyst , fluorospiroindolone b was attained in excellent yield ( 86% ) and high enantioselectivity ( 84% ee ) ( table , entry ) .","using either sc ( otf ) or , 3 - bis ( 3 , 5 bis ( trifluoromethyl ) phenyl ) thiourea provides an efficient ( and less eensive ) catalyst for the preparation of racemic spiroindolones ( table , entries and ) ."
"this method has previously only been reported for less - functionalized substrates , but here the conditions generally afforded low yields ( 33 - 40% ) for the more complex oxindole substrates .","this method was also considered to be attractive because it provides access to diverse aryl triazoles , including amino - substituted triazoles that are not available when preparing azides from amines ."
"azides a - f were selected to include indolyl , pyridyl , ester , and phenyl derivatives in order to provide a variation in molecular weights , hydrogen bonding donor and acceptor properties , and capabilities for interactions .","azides a - e were each prepared from the amine using diazotransfer reagent , and azide f was prepared by direct displacement of a chloride with sodium azide ."
"due to the similarity of hydroxy - oxindoles - 15 , the retention of enantiomeric excess for ba was used as a model for retention of enantioselectivity for all triazole products .",enantiomerically - enriched spiroindolone b was used to demonstrate that the enantiomeric excess for this class of spirooxindoles is retained under cuaac reaction conditions ( entry ) .
"however , the success of the spirocyclization is dependent on the nature of the triazole substrate ( see supporting information ) .","for spirooxazoline - triazole , the titanium ( iv ) - catalyzed addition and spirocyclization of - methoxyoxazole e can also be performed using a triazole - containing isatin ( derived from azide a ) in % yield and maintaining high diastereoselectivity ( 97 dr ) ."

"this fact makes it necessary to deepen in the knowledge of how they affect aging , their interaction with the most prevalent chronic diseases in the elderly and their immune response in order to apply preventive measures that offer a better protection to this population group .","the - 2018 influenza season showed a moderate , early - onset activity ( approximately weeks ) with longer epidemic duration than usual ( 13 weeks ) ."
this fact has also been reported in the spanish influenza surveillance network - 2018 report .,"at the primary care level , the most affected were those under years of age with a cumulative incidence of 6 in the - 4 age group or 4 in the - 14 age group ."
"acute encephalopathy syndromes as a complication of influenza infection has been previously described by other authors in children and adults , but our observation in unvaccinated adult population with risk factors to develop influenza complications underscores the need for higher vaccination coverage in at risk population despite age .","there are some limitations to be taken into account , such as the fact that the total hospitalization burden including non - severe hospital admitted cases with laboratory confirmed influenza is not included ."
"in conclusion the - 2018 influenza season in catalonia was , as in the rest of spain , an unusual epidemic season with an early onset , great predominance of influenza b ( yamagata strain ) virus circulation followed by a second wave of influenza a ( subtypes h3n2 and ( h1n1 ) pdm09 ) that resulted in a high hospitalization rate of severe cases especially among the elderly .",the low vaccine coverage among > 64 age group stresses the need to upgrade vaccine uptake in this age group as well as in those of any age with a risk factor for presenting influenza related complications .
"thus , data from the - month period immediately after the gb implementation were included in the pre - gb period .","because the new health insurance policy may have had a lag effect on physicians ' decision regarding sga prescription , we used january as the timepoint to divide the data , which was months after gb implementation ."
"the gb program was introduced in taiwan for dental services in ; it was subsequently initiated for chinese medicine in , for western medicine community clinics in , and finally for hospital services ( including out - and inpatient services ) in .",the implementation of gb has resulted in a reduction in the number of admissions and the adoption of an efficient case - mix .
"for the purpose of reducing the growing eenditures on health care , the bureau of national health insurance ( bnhi ) in taiwan introduced "" hospital - based selfmanagement "" in january , which is a hospital - based gb program .",the bnhi encouraged hospitals to participate voluntarily in the hospital - based self - management project .
business operating characteristics such as finance and management model are assumed to be different among various types of hospitals .,"furthermore , psychiatric services in taiwan are provided by four main types of institutions : medical centers , psychiatric centers , public hospitals , and private hospitals ."
"first , does the implementation of hospital - based gb affect psychiatrists ' ongoing prescription of sga for the treatment of schizophrenia ?","second , if this kind of impact does exist , is it different among various types of hospitals ?"
"this study was approved by the institutional review board of yuli hospital , haulien , taiwn .","data from between and were collected from the nhi database , which included outpatients who were diagnosed as having schizophrenia during the period of e2001 ."
""" event "" indicates the implementation of gb ; event is the condition prior to the implementation of gb and event is the condition after the implementation of gb .",""" proportion "" indicates the proportion of sga eenditure ; "" time "" is the number of months between the starting point of the database and the point under examination ."
"to examine whether the trends in the proportion of sga eenditure changed after the dividing timepoint between the public and private sectors , we similarly assessed whether the interactions between time , event , and type were significant .",""" type "" indicates the types of sectors ; type indicates the public sector and type indicates the private sector ."
"prior to the dividing timepoint , the proportion of sga eenditures continue to rise , whereas there was no obvious "" rising trends "" after the dividing timepoint with the apparent plateau lasting for months .",second - generation antipsychotic usage continued to rise after the regulations restricting the use of sgas were loosened in september .
"the proportion of sga eenditures in public hospitals showed a smooth upward trend , whereas the proportion in private hospitals demonstrated a progressive decline .","in addition , the trends of sga use between these two types of hospitals were significantly different after the dividing timepoint ( t , p < 19 ; fig ."
"our findings indicate that the change in the medical payment system through the implementation of gb did indeed affect physicians ' behavior , which was manifested by the prescription of sgas and by the varying prescription pattern of sgas based on hospital type .",the proportion of sga eenditures markedly increased after september when sga regulations were loosened .
"a set of indicators is assessed : quality indicators , observation indicators , and survey indicators .","if the medical cost is above a predetermined upper limit , the nhi will not cover the amount that exceeds the limit ."
some private hospitals in taiwan have conversely adopted a physician fee program to improve physicians ' performance .,"in addition , the public sector tends to be held to a higher standard by the general population to meet their eectations , and this suggests that physicians in the public sector are likely to have a stronger concern for the welfare of the patients ."
"e25 in view of the better efficacy for refractory patients , fewer and less severe neuromuscular side effects , and improved life quality , sga use in psychiatric care could accordingly be an indicator of the quality of treatment in schizophrenic patients .","in our study , the sga use pattern in public psychiatric centers appeared least likely to be influenced by the implementation of gb ( i . e . , by financial incentives ) ."
"our study described findings related to the implementation of a large - scale global budgeting program in taiwan , a country with relatively conservative gross domestic product health costs , and may therefore serve as a useful example for similar countries looking to develop effective strategies that can reign in escalating health care costs .",a - year period of observation was analyzed ( 1.5 years prior to and years after the implementation of gb ) .
"in recent years , metabolic syndrome caused by sgas has become an important issue .","e29 many psychiatrists are becoming more cautious and conservative in prescribing sgas because of education by reading current literature , engaging in peer group discussions , and attending international forums ."
"more research is needed on this increasingly important issue because many governments are adopting health policies to contain eenditure , which could result in reduced quality of care , especially for those with severe mental illness .","we herein propose several recommendations , based on our findings that health policymakers may find useful ."
our findings demonstrated that the quality of care in public psychiatric hospitals for chronic psychotic patients must be enhanced .,"in addition , public psychiatric hospitals may offer better treatments for patients with chronic schizophrenia who need long - term institutional care ."
"in spite of first - world nationalism that imagines its subjects as immune to the threat of infectious disease , our post - postmodern , post - human , postnatural society nevertheless retains the structural paradigms of contagion and infection in discourses beyond biomedicine .","in this capacity , contagion still threatens certain lives whether it be by way of suicidality , chronic diseases such as cancer or obesity , or physical and fi nancial productivity ."
"th at is , our current social constructions rely on paradigms that represent nearly everything as communicable : fears ( especially of non - contagious illnesses ) , media campaigns ( such as susan g . komen ' s so - called "" pink - washing "" eff orts ) , social activism ( the pandemic spread of k philanthropy ) , viral videos and memes , and so forth .",epidemic discourse so thoroughly structures our world that it is endemic to our processes of social construction .
"moreover , recent research and popular media attention to how digital , social , and mobile media aff ect heath and behavior , while itself often characterized under the rubric of "" virality , "" speaks to the timeliness of investigating how contagion is currently operating as a discourse and what kind of cultural work it is doing .","th e advent of research on the microbiome and antibiotic - resistant infections , for instance , has signifi cantly changed how we understand humans ' relationship to microbial life ."
our volume unites these methodological aims in the pursuit of an innovative theoretical perspective and peers through the interstices of biological materiality and symbolic import .,"and , in contrast to the prevailing focus on contagion via epidemic patterns , this volume theorizes contagion as operant through an endemic prevalence in discourse and society ."
"th e victim of an epidemic disease , that is , at least functions in their death to relieve society of an unproductive member .","th e endemically ill linger and metaphorically contribute in the social imaginary to the troubling endemic conditions of "" wasted energy "" and "" costs "" which neoliberal actors seek to track , mitigate , and eliminate both in and beyond traditional disciplinary structures of the school , the prison , and the workplace ."
th e relationship between biopolitics and contagion is ultimately about the production of self and the social .,"contagion can be broadly characterized as any kind of infl uence that threatens our agentive control of our health , behavior , emotions , and social bonds ."
"by understanding the ways that this pathogenic model is so imbedded in our cultural logic , contagion becomes a way to rethink the liberal and neoliberal conceptualizations of autonomous , cordoned subjectivity , challenging the distinction between self and other to facilitate community rather than quarantine , to resist social darwinistic models of selffashioning , to challenge the hierarchal conceptualizations of humanness .","as marget pelling has suggested , "" contagion ' s capacity for excess has interested rather than frightened some in postmodernity , encouraging some to give up the dream [ of hygienic containment ] "" ( pelling , p . ) ."
"in greek and roman times , for instance , the infl uence of religion , ideas , and love was thought to infl uence physical health ( pernick ) .","even the elicit and intended use of the term as metaphor rather than description of a biological entity or process is , as martin pernick observes , historically contingent ."
"while some contributors focus on biological iterations and others on the social , cultural , or digital "" metaphors "" of contagion , rather than parsing phenomena in one category or the other , each of the authors in this volume considers the concept holistically , examining ways that the biological and the fi gurative borrow from each other to shape the various discursive topoi of biomedicine , political economy , media , epistemology , and other systems of thought .","th us , much like contagious discourse itself , this volume considers both the metaphorical and the biological forms of the endemicity of contagion , without seeking to - and in many ways avowedly refusing to - demarcate where the one begins and the other ends ."

"""
"first , mathieu donner ' s chapter argues for a reasoning methodology that bridges epidemiology and epistemology .","woo ' s post - humanist theorization of contagion points toward our fi nal section , "" reconstructing contagion , "" which features three essays focused on the ways that contagious discourse might be constructively reconfi gured toward shaping a world more engaged in critical bioethics ."
"she goes on to show that infectious discourse is often used either to reify ( what she characterizes as "" epidemic narratives "" ) or to challenge ( in the case of "" endemic narratives "" ) normative gender constructs .","bollinger suggests that the fear of festering microbes is a palimpsest for anxieties about gender norms ; the proliferating germ inside a body turns all human bodies - that is , male and female - into gestational spaces ."
"th e authors juxtapose the nonchalant first - world designation of a variety of th ird - world endemics - diseases that are thusly constructed as beyond the reach ( or necessity ) of aid because of their perceived inevitable pervasivenessagainst first - world constructions of its own "" epidemics "" such as obesity .","reading the often naturalized diseased state attached to particular th ird - world locations , they contend that "" there is no such thing as endemic disease "" but rather that these states are humanmade confi gurations - products of political , economic , public health , and agricultural policies and practices that "" make disease .

it is only the ends to which they are used that we can hope to guide .,"however , we maintain that at the interstices of material , biological realities and metaphoric potential lie political power and social meanings that warrant serious consideration ; for , as the authors in this volume demonstrate , these power structures and epistemologies are already in play ."

"canine parvovirus may also threaten island foxes , particularly juveniles , because it can cause debilitating enteritis and panleukopenia in juvenile and na ve adult domestic dogs ( pollack and carmichael , ) .","canine parvovirus may also have affected the recovery of some grey wolf ( canis lupus ) and red wolf ( canis rufus ) populations through increased pup mortality ( mech and goyal , ) or poor juvenile survival ( munson , unpublished ) ."
"based on their natural history , clinical disease due to primary t . gondii or leptospira interrogans would be rare in island foxes but other stressors ( starvation , concurrent disease , placement in captivity ) could make them more vulnerable to clinical disease .","neonatal dogs and captive coyote pups also can get a fatal generalized chv infection ( appel , ; evermann et al . , ) ."
"to address these concerns , eure to selected infectious disease agents that could threaten fox persistence was examined by conducting a systematic serologic survey of foxes and sympatric feral cats for antibodies against pathogens known to infect canids .",feral cats were also surveyed for eure to feline - specific diseases that cause immune suppression and thereby increase the susceptibility of cats to infection with canid pathogens .
"serum samples from foxes on all six islands collected between and were assayed for antibodies against cdv , cav , ccv and chv , using serum neutralization ( sn ) tests ( appel and robson , ) ; cpv using a hemagglutination inhibition ( hai ) test ( carmichael et al . , ) ( positive titer p : 10 ) ; and six leptospira interrogans serovars ( icterohaemorrhagiae , pomona , canicola , hardjo , grippotyphosa , and bratislava ) using the microagglutination ( mia ) test ( cole et al . , ) ( positive titer p : 100 ) .","for cdv , the onderstepoort viral strain was inoculated onto vero cells ."
"all cats sampled , and a subset of fox samples , were tested for feline calicivirus ( fcv ) antibodies by sn using virus atcc ( positive titer p : 8 for cats and foxes ) ( harrison et al . , ) .","the fcv sn may also detect related caliciviruses ( dubovi , unpublished ) ."
"the presence of felv p27 antigen was detected by microtiter plate elisa ( idexx petchek , idexx , portland , me , usa ) and results classified as positive ( including equivocal ) or negative ( lutz et al . , ) .","' ' equivocal ' ' samples were classified as ' ' positive ' ' , and ' ' high negative ' ' samples were classified as ' ' negative ' ' for statistical analysis , as previous work has shown that the majority of cats testing ' ' equivocal ' ' are actually positive for fiv ; and cats testing ' ' high negative ' ' are usually negative on confirmatory western blot testing ( barr et al . , ) ."
"the prevalence of cdv - antibody positive wild or wild - born foxes on sni was greater than sri , scz , sca and sci , thus sni foxes were times more likely to be cdv - antibody positive than foxes on the other four islands during the study period .","wild ( or wild - born ) foxes with cdv - suspect antibody titers were present on all six islands , with the prevalence on sri being significantly lower than scz , sca , sci and sni ."
"the prevalence of positive cdv antibody titers significantly decreased each year on sni ( lr v = 5 , p < 01 ; or = 71 , % ci for or = 24-0.590 ) .","on sri , one of nine wild - born foxes tested had a positive cdv antibody titer in , but none of five wild - born foxes tested in were positive ."
san cornell canine distemper virus sn assay results did not differ significantly for repeated test runs ( exact mcnemar ' s v p = 19 ) .,"replicate agreement was excellent for positive ( antibody titer p : 16 ) samples ( j = 38 ) , but agreement decreased slightly when suspect samples were included ( j = 72 ) ."
"on scz , cpv prevalence was much greater in ( 93.3% ) compared to % in - 2002 ( v = 1 , p < 01 ) .","prevalence on scz was significantly lower than sni , sca and sri ; and cpv prevalence on sca was significantly lower than sni ."
canine adenovirus antibodies were present in foxes on all but sca ( table ) .,"both sci and sni had greater cav prevalence than scz , while sci was also greater than sni ."
antibodies to neospora caninum were not detected in any foxes sampled .,antibodies to t . gondii were absent in all captive - born foxes sampled .
"additionally , one captive - born fox sampled on sri was positive for lepto b . eure .","wild and wild - born foxes in captivity on four islands ( sri , scz , sca , and sci ) had eure to lepto b . with sci and sri having the highest prevalence ."
"antibodies to cdv , fiv , fplv , and fcov / fip and felv antigen were only detected in the sca cat population .","all three islands with feral cat populations had detectable antibodies to fcv and t . gondii , with sci having a significantly lower prevalence of fcv than sca and sni , and lower t . gondii prevalence than sca ( table ) ."
"prevalence differences between cats and foxes were statistically significant on sca for fcv ( v = 1 , p < 01 ) , cdv ( fisher exact p = 46 ) , t . gondii ( v = 4 , p < 01 ) and cpv / fplv ( v = 7 , p < 01 ) .","although cpv is highly prevalent in foxes on sca , sci and sni , only one cat on sca had antibodies against cpv / fplv ."
"the placement of large numbers of remaining foxes into captivity , while critical for recovery efforts , further exacerbated the risk that disease could cause significant mortality or inhibit reproduction and eventual recovery .","although the distribution of the island fox is inherently limited to six of the california channel islands , human alterations of the ecosystems have put this unique species at risk of extinction from unnatural predation pressure ( roemer et al . , ) and possibly through introduction of a more pathogenic strain of canine distemper virus ( timm et al . , ) ."
"the existence of cdv - antibody positive and suspect young foxes on sca , sni and scz for three consecutive years indicates that some foxes were recently eed to distemper in the absence of detectable mortality in radio - collared individuals and recovered carcasses .",five of the six island fox populations have been eed to canine distemper virus and eure appears to have occurred only in the wild .
it is possible that a low pathogenicity island - fox adapted cdv strain evoking low antibody titers evolved and now circulates among island foxes without the continued presence of domestic dogs .,re - analyzing the fox samples with the more sensitive assay allowed us to compare our study results directly with samples from before the decline and document a previous eure to canine distemper virus .
"all but one cdv - antibody positive island fox in our study had natural eure titers of less than : 100 ; similarly low level antibody titers ( < 1:10 0 ) occur in island foxes after cdv vaccination ( timm et al . , ) .","however , in domestic dogs , previous vaccination does not guarantee protection from an overwhelming viral infection or challenge with a highly pathogenic cdv strain ( greene and appel , ) ."
"our results suggest that cpv is highly prevalent and remains endemic on all the islands , except possibly smi .","although there was no evidence of cpv eure in wild - born smi foxes , the presence of cpv eure in captive - born foxes suggests the virus is still present on the island ."
"it is possible cav was introduced sometime between and , and eure prevalence has subsequently decreased as a consequence of the severe population decline on scz , causing the virus to fade - out .","in , no eure to cav was reported on scz ( garcelon et al . , ) , but then eure was documented in scz foxes sampled from to ( roemer et al . , ) and our study documented low positive cav antibody titers in wild scz foxes after ."
"despite the continuous presence of domestic dogs on the island and the highly contagious nature of cav , foxes on sca still remain naive to cav .","this is likely due to the fact that clinical disease is very rare in dogs because of vaccination ( green , ) ."
"fox pup mortality on santa catalina island can approach % in the wild ( clifford , unpublished ) .",the contribution of disease to the observed mortality is not known due to the difficulty in recovering carcasses from dens .
the lack of eure to t . gondii in captive - born foxes supports the contention that transmission occurs via contact with feral cat feces or from infected prey found in the wild .,"antibodies to t . gondii were also detected on two islands that do not have feral cats ( scz and sri ) , suggesting foxes were eed through consumption of infected bird or marine mammal carcasses ( dailey , ; dubey et al . , b ) ."
the absence of neospora caninum antibodies in sampled foxes may indicate this protozoal parasite does not exist on the islands .,"a single report of n . caninum being found in the feces of two of nine sni foxes ( roemer et al . , ) contradicts our findings and warrants follow up to differentiate the oocysts of n . caninum by molecular methods from those of the morphologically identical fox parasite , hammondia heydorni ( gondim et al . , a ) ."
"leptospirosis is an endemic disease in california sea lions ( zalophus californianus ) that breed on the islands and has caused reproductive failure and periodic epidemics of severe renal disease in these populations ( gulland et al . , ; smith et al . , ) .",island foxes may serve as an important sentinel for the presence of different leptospira serovars in the california channel islands ecosystem as they inhabit the near - shore environment and interact with both terrestrial and marine mammals that may be harboring leptospira .
"antibodies to chv and ccv remain restricted to a few islands , with an apparent prevalence decrease since ( garcelon et al . , ) .","we found no eure to chv in our sri sample , although this subspecies had evidence of eure in ( 12% ) ."
"rabies outbreaks in african wild dogs ( kat et al . , ) and ethiopian wolves ( canis simensis ) ( randall et al . , ; sillero - zubiri et al . , ) and the cdv epidemic in lions ( panthera leo ) from the serengeti ( roelke - parker et al . , ) were believed to have originated from nearby domestic dog populations .","most extinctions and near - extinctions of wildlife populations from disease are caused by generalist pathogens with a wide host range that ' ' spill over ' ' from domestic to wildlife species ( woodroffe , ) ."
the presence of cdv antibodies in two feral cats on sca likely occurred via spillover from foxes or dogs .,"the two cdv - antibody positive cats were also eed to fiv and felv , possibly making these individuals more susceptible to cdv infection ."
"although foxes on islands with cats have a higher prevalence of cpv / fplv than foxes on islands without cats , the lack of cpv / fplv antibodies in sympatric cats provides strong evidence that cats are not a primary source of eure for foxes .","while caliciviruses have been shown to infect a variety of hosts and could possibly be passed between cats and foxes ( smith et al . , ) , the inverse relationship between fox and cat calicivirus eure in our study and the presence of calicivirus antibodies in foxes on islands without cats suggests this interaction is not necessary for fox infection ."
"additionally , a dramatic decrease in foxes trapped ( from to ) and fox density ( 11 foxes / km to foxes / km ) occurred on sni between and , and further decreased ( 3 foxes , foxes / km ) in ( laughrin , ) .","during the s , fox numbers and density remained very low ( 0.5 foxes / km ) on sca ."
"this surveillance will provide the basis for management decisions on all the islands , especially during active recovery efforts .",the suspected susceptibility to cdv and absence of documented morbidity or mortality in foxes eed to other pathogens strongly argue for continued intensive disease surveillance .
"lastly the authors wish to thank the national park service , the nature conservancy , the santa catalina island conservancy and the united states navy for permission to conduct this project on their land .","this study was funded by grant from morris animal foundation , and was conducted in accordance with a mou between the institute for wildlife studies and the california department of fish and game , scientific collecting permit ( d . clifford ) , and university of california davis animal care and use protocol ."
this paper describes a study aiming at the standardization of the maintenance processes of medical tss by capturing the criteria for the management of the maintenance processes into a framework .,"furthermore , this paper describes application of the framework , which sheds light on the current practice of ts maintenance ."
results were stratified by the size of the ts being maintained .,the current practice of ts maintenance was elored by a survey among organizations that maintain a ts .
the increase in number of tss is demonstrated by the growth of the umls metathesaurus that now integrates ( umls ab release ) tss .,"throughout different generations , these tss have developed from single - purpose , inextensible systems to extensible multi - purpose systems ."
", full - time equivalents are responsible for the maintenance processes .",the need for standardization of the maintenance of medical tss has been discussed by several authors .
the second goal is to apply the developed framework to gain insight into the current maintenance practice of existing tss and to evaluate whether the introduction of the framework triggers the wish for maintenance process redesign .,"this framework can be used as a reference to design , evaluate and improve the maintenance process of ( new and existing ) tss ."
a search in the medical literature from until was performed using medline .,"the following mesh headings ( indicated by an asterisk ) and terms were used : "" terminology * , "" "" vocabulary * , "" "" terminological system , "" and "" record coding system , "" combined with "" guideline * , "" "" maintenance * , "" and "" upgrading . """
papers found with this supplementary search were considered relevant when they described the maintenance process of a ( terminological ) system .,"to elore the internet , from october to january , google searches were performed using the same key words as described above ."
"this draft version was evaluated via a first questionnaire by the maintainers of tss and the results were published in raiez et al . , .",the extensive literature search described in the previous paragraph was performed to identify additional criteria for the maintenance process .
"for the remaining tss included in the umls no valid contact information , i . e . , email addresses , was available .","to increase the response rate reminders were sent two weeks , four weeks and six weeks after the first request ."
"for each topic , the respondents were asked how their current maintenance activities were organized and what the desired situation would be .","most of the questions were multiple - choice with an "" other , namely "" option to enter complementary free text remarks ."
the medline search from until resulted in twenty - eight relevant publications .,the supplementary search ( including papers referenced by other papers and the internet ) resulted in another thirty - five publications .
"the other three components support carrying out the core activities of primary component "" execution . ""","these components encompass : ) "" process management , "" describing the coordination and management of the maintenance process and the disciplines involved , ) "" change specifications , "" describing the possible changes that occur in the tss and how to deal with them and ) "" editing tools , "" in most cases software applications that are used for various activities ."
"below , the four components are described for the situation in which there is a maximal adherence to the criteria .",it should be noted that in some cases not all criteria are feasible and that an optimal management of the maintenance process does not necessarily satisfy all criteria .
"for a large number of tss in use , change suggestion forms are available from their websites .","to optimize the process of change proposal , proposals are submitted using structured and standardized forms ."
"furthermore , the impact of the proposed change on the ts model is determined before implementing it ( e . g . , impact on hierarchical relations ) .","for each proposal , the maintenance team determines whether or not the change is desired ( e . g . , the change does not lead to redundancies ) and whether it is possible to incorporate the proposed change into the ts ( e . g . , the proposed change does not violate the terminology domain or structure ) ."
other tss use similar criteria to evaluate the proposals for changes .,"once a change has been incorporated into the ts , the maintenance team verifies the change on completeness , textual errors , consistency of the hierarchical relations , consistency of mappings to other tss and consistency of mappings to other languages ."
"for each change that is incorporated into the ts , additional information is documented .",the amount and type of docu - mented information depend on the change type and the number of concepts involved in the change operation .
another option is to provide a list with the accepted changes that can be imported into the previous version of the system ( incremental update ) .,the choice of the update method depends on the volume and the complexity of the changes made .
"therefore , we suggest to apply the centralized maintenance model that requires that the maintenance process is coordinated and carried out by a qualified maintenance team .",", , this maintenance team is easily accessible and responds quickly to proposals and questions ."
", terminology eerts and ontologists are involved because of their knowledge of the structure and the architecture of the ts .",software engineers are involved because of their knowledge of the technical possibilities and functions of the system .
"technical decisions during the development of a ts can impact its capacity to grow , change and remain usable over time .",", , to this end , a change policy needs to be adopted when developing a ts ."
"in case of removal of a concept ( which is not in accordance with the criteria ) , the code assigned to that concept is not reused so that consistency of data over time is not violated .","finally , within the ts there are no limitations for the number of concepts , hierarchic levels and terms that can be added ."
"the maintenance team uses a "" change model "" based on the change policies described above to define permitted "" change operations "" such as insertion of new concepts .","the goal of making changes in a ts is to keep the ts up to date , while ascertaining the consistency of the concept model ."
"in general , a distinction is made between the change operations that do and those that do not affect the hierarchy of the concept model .",", change operations that do not affect the hierarchy , e . g . , changes in concept descriptions such as addition of synonyms or deletion of terms , are relatively easy to implement ."
", finally tools might also provide functionalities to support the management of the maintenance process such as managing access rights ( security ) and collection of proposals .",", furthermore , the tools can be used for consistency control , e . g . , to identify duplicates , inappropriate coding , errors in relationships , and inconsistencies after the modification of concepts ."
"due to space limitations , the desired situation as indicated by the respondents is not extensively described in the tables .",figure gives an overview of the number of additional criteria that the participating organizations wish to fulfil for their maintenance processes after being confronted with the framework .
"as shown in figure , the respondents do not wish to make large changes in their maintenance process to meet more criteria .","in most of the cases , the desired changes concerned the functions of the editing tools ."
"however , although the need for standardization of the ts maintenance process is recognized in literature , few publications are available on this topic .","without a well - structured and standardized maintenance process , tss cannot provide the quality required by today ' s medical applications ."
"as far as we know , this study is the only work that provides an extensive survey of the maintenance process of medical tss .",available literature on the maintenance of medical tss mainly focuses on technical aspects of the maintenance process and to our knowledge no other attempts have been made to standardize the organizational issues around the maintenance process .
"information that was considered suitable and relevant for our study , mainly came from publications outside the medical domain .","although many publications , guidelines and standards on maintenance of software systems are available , these mainly focus on the technical aspects of the maintenance process ."
"in our study , the mean response time of the maintenance teams varies between days for quartile i , and days for quartile iii .",almost all respondents wish to reduce their response time for processing the proposals .
"accordingly , the results show that a majority of the large tss ( i . e . , tss in quartile iv ) fulfil most of the criteria .","furthermore , large tss are generally more complex and thus necessitate extensive management of the maintenance processes ."
"the criterion of using a "" change model "" forms an exception since the maintainers of smaller tss more often use a "" change model "" than the maintainers of the large tss .","however , a closer look at the component "" change specifications "" shows that the larger tss satisfy more of the remaining criteria in this component and have extensive change policies ."
"it is notable that many of the respondents of the survey , even when their maintenance process was incomplete and was not compliant with most of the criteria , did not wish to redesign their maintenance process after being confronted with the framework .",most of the wanted changes regard the functions of the editing tools and are especially mentioned by the respondents of the larger tss ( in the fourth quartile ) .
the maintainers can use the framework as a guideline to prioritize the processes that have to be implemented and to decide which criteria should be fulfilled given their own possibilities and needs .,the framework presented here can be applied to a ts in conformity with the needs and the possibilities of its maintainers .
"for our study , especially because we aimed to include a large number of tss , it was not doable to use objective observation methods to get the answers .",the criteria cover rather specific topics that are in general only answerable by the maintainers of a ts and therefore only the maintainers could provide complete answers to related set of questions .
the model of such a maintenance process is characterized as centralized or semicentralized .,"the idea of a semantic wiki is that qualified users can directly add new concepts to the ts , or refine or modify existing ones while taking the semantic structure of the ts into account ."
the framework developed within this study summarizes the principal notions that are important for the management of the maintenance process of medical tss .,it is applicable to all kinds of medical tss and provides their maintainers with the criteria for a well - organized maintenance process .

"this could be elained by the fact that the former incin er a tor ( ba1 and ba2 ) dis posed of hw in a big city , includ ing approx i mately hospi tals ; thus the hw dis posed in this incin er a tion plant con tains higher amounts of metal lic objects , such as alu mi num cans , scalpels , nee dles , syrin ges or small metal lic med i cal tools , than the small hos pi tal - run incin er a tion facil ity .","when these metal wastes are incin er ated , the ashes are often enriched with met als ."
"cr is gen er ally not ther mally mobile dur ing the incin er a tion pro cess , and thus mainly remains in the bot tom ash ( jung et al . , ) .","in the hw ashes , ag tends to be enriched in fly ash , prob a bly due to the lower boil ing points of sil ver com pounds , e . g . , the boil ing point of sil ver nitrate is c ."

"previously , recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus ( rvsv ) pseudotypes eressing ebolavirus glycoproteins ( gps ) in place of the vsv g protein demonstrated protection of nonhuman primates from lethal homologous ebolavirus challenge .",those pseudotype vectors contained no additional attenuating mutations in the rvsv genome .
these rvsv vectors contain the same combination of attenuating mutations used previously in the clinical development pathway of an rvsv / human immunodeficiency virus type vaccine .,here we describe rvsv vectors containing a full complement of vsv genes and eressing the ebola virus ( ebov ) gp from an additional transcription unit .
"the genus ebolavirus is classified within the filoviridae family and comprises closely related but antigenically distinct virus species : bundibugyo ebolavirus , reston ebolavirus , sudan ebolavirus , tai forest ebolavirus , and zaire ebolavirus .","in nature , all but reston virus have been isolated only in sub - saharan africa , where the likely virus reservoir is thought to be in bats ."
"one of these proteins is the ebov glycoprotein ( ebovgp ) , which mediates virion attachment and fusion to susceptible cells .","the ebov genome is composed of a single strand of negative - sense rna , approximately kb in length , encoding major viral polypeptides ."
for a thorough review of vaccine approaches see falzarano et al .,"the ebovgp also contains the major virus neutralization epitopes ; accordingly , the ebovgp has been the target for a variety of ebov vaccine designs ."
vsv can also infect humans who have close contact with infected animals or purified virus .,"infection results in mild influenza - like symptoms , which typically resolve in - 5 days without complications ."
"vsv exhibits a pronounced to gradient of gene eression due to discontinuous messenger rna ( mrna ) transcription across intergenic regions , allowing modulation of virus protein or foreign antigen eression as a function of gene distance from the transcription promoter .",a highly attenuated rvsv vector eressing human immunodeficiency virus type ( hiv ) gag from the first position in the genome was developed and has been demonstrated to be safe in stringent mouse and nonhuman primate ( nhp ) neurovirulence and biodistribution studies .
the vector that elicited the most balanced ebovgp - specific humoral and cellular immune response in mice was then evaluated for protective efficacy in guinea pig and nhp challenge studies .,here we describe the generation of attenuated rvsv vectors eressing ebovgp and their immunogenicity in mice .

"the n4ct1 - hivgag1 genomic cdna was modified by exchanging the gag gene located in position of the genome with the ebovgp gene ( 1976 , mayinga isolate ) , generating n4ct1 - ebovgp1 cdna ( gp1 ; figure a ) .","as described previously , the n4ct1 - hivgag1 vector was used as template for generating all rvsv / ebov vectors eressing ebovgp ."
"for animal studies , vectors were purified from infected cell supernatants by centrifugation through a % sucrose cushion .",rescued virus was plaque purified and amplified on vero cell monolayers ( atcc ccl - 81 ) .
cumulative deaths across all doses tested allowed the % lethal dose to be calculated for each vector .,mice that were showing severe signs of disease or were moribund were promptly euthanized .
on day after vaccination guinea pigs were challenged with focus - forming units ( ffu ) of guinea pig - adapted ebov ( gpa - ebov ) by intraperitoneal injection .,all animals were weighed daily and monitored for signs of illness .
"at study day , macaques were anesthetized with ketamine and inoculated in the caudal thigh muscle with pfu of rvsv / ebov vector ( total volume , ml ) .","for macaque challenge , healthy , ebov - naive , adult ( age , - 10 years ; weight , - 12 kg ) , male and female rhesus macaques ( macaca mulatta ) were randomly assigned to a vaccination group ( n = ) and a nonvaccination control group ( n = ) ."
"for murine studies , vaccine - elicited ifn - elispot responses were determined using a mouse ifn - elispot kit ( bd biosciences , san diego , california ) as previously described .","splenocytes were incubated with g / ml con - a ( sigma ) , peptide pools ( 15 - mers overlapping by aa ; final peptide concentration , m [ each ] ) spanning ebovgp , or medium alone ."
antigen - specific antibody titers were defined as the reciprocal of the last serum dilution giving an od of > 0.1 .,murine serum samples were added to elisa plates at a starting dilution of : 100 and were further diluted - fold across the plates .
"ten days after primary immunizations , splenocytes were collected from mice / group and tested for ebovgp - specific ifn - secretion by elispot assay .",the remaining mice / group were boosted intramuscularly at study week with pfu of each rvsv / ebov vector .
"interestingly , n4ct1 - ebovgp1 muc , elicited a significantly reduced response ( mean sem , sfcs / 10 splenocytes ) relative to n4ct1 - ebovgp1 and n4ct1 - ebovgp1 .","notably , after immunization , gp responses were undetectable in mice immunized with vectors eressing ebovgp from genome positions or ."
"after boosting , the highest mean ebovgp - specific ifn - elispot responses ( sem ) were again detected in mice immunized with n4ct1 - ebovgp1 tm ( 211 sfcs / 10 splenocytes ) and n4ct1 - ebovgp1 ( mean sem , sfcs / 10 splenocytes ) .","mice immunized with n4ct1 - ebovgp1 muc showed an improved response ( mean sem , sfcs / splenocytes ) , and mice boosted with n4ct1 - ebovgp3 or n4ct1 - ebovgp6 still failed to demonstrate a measurable ebovgp - specific ifn - elispot response ."
"interestingly , a statistically significant , approximately - fold lower ebovgp - specific igg titer was detected in mice immunized with n4ct1 - ebovgp1 tm ( mean sem , 5 5 ) relative to mice immunized with n4ct1 - ebovgp1 .",a - fold lower titer was also detected in mice immunized with n4ct1 - ebovgp6 ( 4.21 2 ) relative to mice immunized with vectors eressing ebovgp from genome positions or .
"for controls , additional groups of guinea pigs were immunized with pfu of wtvsv or medium alone .","in this eeriment , guinea pigs were immunized intraperitoneally with pfu of n4ct1 - ebovgp1 ."
"in contrast , n4ct1 - ebovgp1 immunized guinea pigs gained weight and were completely protected from disease during the course of the study .",guinea pigs immunized with medium alone or wtvsv began to lose weight on day after challenge and died from ebov infection during study days and as observed previously .
"importantly , a rapid increase in the ebovgp - specific serum igg titer was observed on days , , and after challenge in both vaccinated macaques , and they survived without showing signs of disease .","as shown in table , the single control animal failed to mount an ebovgp - specific response on day after challenge and quickly died from ebov infection ."
"to test the neurovirulence potential of n4ct1 - ebovgp1 , groups of outbred swiss webster mice were inoculated intracranially with n4ct1 - ebovgp1 in a dose - ranging study ( 10 pfu ; figure ) .",two control groups were inoculated with pfu of a less attenuated rvsv ( rvsv - hivgag5 ) or with pbs alone .
"importantly , all mice inoculated with n4ct1 - ebovgp1 survived and were disease free .","consistent with previously published reports , mice inoculated intracranially with pbs survived , and approximately half of the mice inoculated with rvsv - hivgag5 died - 5 days after inoculation ."
"here we demonstrate protection of guinea pigs and nhps with a highly attenuated , replication competent form of rvsv that retains the vsv g gene and eresses the ebovgp from an additional transcription unit inserted at position in the rvsv genome .","the rvsv vector used in those studies retained the natural vsv genome organization , except the vsv g gene was replaced with the ebovgp gene ."
"interestingly , there was a significant reduction in the cell - mediated immune response to ebovgp when part of the mucin - rich region was deleted , possibly as a result of altered proteosomal processing of ebovgp or direct deletion of t - cell epitopes .","the cell - mediated immune response was similar for secreted and anchored forms of ebovgp , indicating that both forms of ebovgp underwent a similar degree of processing and presentation of t - cell epitopes in antigen - presenting cells ."
"the corollary is that anchored trimeric ebovgp spikes on the surface of infected cells and virus particles present a dense array of structural epitopes that may interact more efficiently with b cells than soluble secreted ebovgp , as is the case for other particulate antigen compositions .","ebovgp - specific igg responses were highest for n4ct1 - ebovgp1 muc , possibly reflecting better eure of ebovgp epitopes by removal of part of the carbohydrate cloak ."
"results confirmed the highly attenuated nature of n4ct1 - ebovgp1 in the mouse central nervous system , indicating that the presence of ebovgp on the virion surface , in addition to vsv g protein , did not enhance virus spread in the brain , presumably because cells in the central nervous system lack the ebovgpspecific receptor and because virus using vsv g receptors remained attenuated as previously described .","therefore , a mouse nv study was performed to assess any changes in virulence arising from the possible alteration of vector tropism mediated by ebovgp ."
"interestingly , there was a slight delay in onset of the first signs of disease after challenge of wtvsv - vaccinated guinea pigs .",one dose of this vector protected guinea pigs from signs of disease following challenge with a lethal dose of gpa - ebov .
a single dose of n4ct1 - ebovgp1 vector also protected nhps from disease following ebov challenge .,"an ebovgpspecific igg titer was detected in both immunized macaques prior to challenge and was eanded following ebov challenge , indicating that a preexisting ebovgp - specific antibody response is important for protection ."
"technology , information , media , food , goods and services , as well as environmental pollution and diseases are shared among villages , cities , countries and continents .","not only are these exchanges great in scope , but the magnitude and speed of interaction among individuals and populations is also increasing ."
implicit in this definition is the ubiquity of globalization processes and the pervasiveness with which these processes affect human lives .,"for the purposes of this review we use an eansive definition for which globalization consists of the "" processes contributing to intensified human interaction in a wide range of spheres ( that is , economic , political , social , environmental ) and across three types of boundaries - spatial , temporal and cognitive - that have hitherto separated individuals and societies "" ( bettcher & lee , ) ."
"instead it is likely that myriad processes comprise globalization , and each may influence the health of populations through multiple pathways .",the challenge lies in elucidating the mechanisms by which globalization affects health .
"the aim of this framework is to facilitate understanding of the complex relationships among globalization , macro - level determinants of health , and population health .",the relationships between each component of the framework and population health will be briefly discussed followed by a presentation of potential mechanisms that may elain these associations .
"we propose a framework that summarizes a few key characteristics of the global , national and community level environments that are associated with population health .",globalization is characterized by a plethora of components that may influence health at the population level .
"global - level factors ( including global trade , income distribution , population movement , global governance and communications ) are conceptualized to shape national - level factors ( infrastructural resources , employment , income growth , population density , and national governance ) .","our framework ( figure . 1 ) builds upon the emerging thinking about multiple "" levels "" of determination of population health ( kaplan , ) and suggests that three levels of variables may be considered central to the role played by globalization in population health ."
this strategy allows clearer and more elicit development of the pathways through which globalization exerts influence on health and is compatible with clinical and epidemiologic approaches to health research .,"although an unconventional approach , we begin by eloring the proximal relationships between community level factors and population health before approaching the more distal national - level and global - level factors ( moving from right to left in figure . 1 ) ."
"for purposes of this review , communities are defined as any sub - national aggregation that is socially meaningful to local residents .","such groupings may be convenient , affordable or otherwise useful for spatial analyses ; however , they do not always carry social meaning for individuals ."
"yet we recognize that multiple elements of communities may interact to shape health indicators through more complex , indirect pathways .",these are the most proximal of the macro - level health determinants that are addressed in this chapter and should therefore affect population health indicators through the most direct pathways .
access to a sufficient quantity and quality of food is essential for proper nutrition .,"malnutrition and undernutrition have severe consequences for growth and development of children ( de onis , monteiro , akre , & glugston , ; stevenson , latham , & ottesen , ; weinreb et al . , ) , as well as for the functioning of the immune system and prevention of disease ( cunningham - rundles , mcneeley , & moon , ) ."
"insufficient physical space in a community may lead to overcrowded housing , which facilitates the spread of communicable diseases such as tuberculosis ( antunes & waldman , ) and helminth infections ( carneiro , cifuentes , tellez - rojo , & romieu , ) .","quality housing protects inhabitants from climate extremes ( heat , cold , wet ) , which contribute to disease and mortality ( evans , hyndman , stewart - brown , smith , & petersen , ; gemmell , ; the eurowinter group , ) ."
many other such directly detrimental social impacts exist at the community level .,"for example , neighborhoods in baltimore , maryland , comprised predominantly of african americans have a higher density of alcohol distributing outlets than neighborhoods with different racial demographics ( laveist & wallace , ) ."
"unequal access to basic resources such as food , water , housing and medical supplies may have repercussions for the entire community by decreasing social cohesion ( wakefield & poland , ) .","social cohesion and collective efficacy help to defend a community against crime and vandalism ( kawachi , kennedy , lochner , & prothrow - stith , ) and provide social resources that buffer the negative health effects of being resource deprived ( sampson , raudenbush , & earls , ) ( see section ) ."
"important issues include presence of these services , physical proximity to communities , cost and distribution .",access to these social services increases opportunities to obtain necessary resources ( discussed above ) and provides a buffer against volatile economic situations .
"furthermore , self - medication may encourage drug resistance , as has been observed with malaria ( evans et al . , ) .","for example , gambian children presenting with severe malaria were significantly more likely to have delayed seeking treatment by more than four days than were those presenting with mild malaria ( meerman et al . , ) ."
"local environments , including homes and workplaces , may be sources of eures to toxic substances , allergens or poor air quality ( bruce et al . , ) .","aspects of the outdoor environment are recognized as contributors to increased injury ( moore , teixeira , & shiell , ) or breeding of disease spreading vectors ( mcmichael et al . , ; moore , gould , & keary , ) ."
"for example , insects that serve as vectors for various infectious diseases may become more abundant or widespread with global warming .","one example is the possible increased range of malaria into previously uninfected highland regions ( bouma , dye , & van der kaay , ; loevinsohn , ; zhou , minakawa , githeko , & yan , ) ."
"as another example , temperature extremes may have direct effects on mortality , especially for poor , elderly or otherwise disadvantaged individuals .","similarly , changes in precipitation and temperature may affect local agricultural yields , thereby affecting food availability with all of the accompanying health implications ( fischer , shah , tubiello , & van velhuizen , ) ."
"social environments shape our interactions , our beliefs and our behaviors , all of which have health effects .","to complicate matters , social environments likely interact with physical environments in their relationships with population health ."
"aspects of the social environment that are likely to influence human health include social disorganization , social resources ( including support and capital ) , social contagion , spatial segregation and inequality .","the theory of neighborhood social disorganization , arising from sociological research of urban chicago in the s , posits that social disorder is conducive to deviant behavior and crime ( shaw & mckay , ) ."
"social resources , including social support and social capital , are recognized to provide better coping mechanisms for difficult situations and are therefore associated with better health ( kawachi & berkman , ; mcleod & kessler , ) .","social capital is also likely to help buffer negative health effects of social disorder by providing economic and social support ( sampson et al . , ) ."
"social contagion , or social influence , is thought to affect health by the sharing of behaviors and attitudes among members of social networks , which can have both positive and negative health effects .","these social norms are important in the transmission of infectious diseases , such as sexually - transmitted infections ( stis ) and hiv ( pick & obermeyer , ; wellington , ndowa , & mbengeranwa , ) , as well as in the spread of behaviors such as suicide ( phillips & carstcnsen , ) and criminality ( jones & jones , ) ."
"poor , segregated populations have restricted access to health care services , shortages of health care providers and many under - or un - insured individuals ( mayberry , mili , & ofili , ) .","finally , segregation and income inequality can cause both perceived and actual inequity , which erodes social trust and diminishes social capital with the resulting health effects as discussed above ."
wealthier individuals may be encouraged to use their money and power to improve the access and distribution of resources needed for good health .,"this heterogeneity may also provide access to broader social networks , including positive role models and salubrious social norms ."
"cross - national comparisons of health indicators have investigated the effects of national income ( dollar , ; lynch , smith , kaplan , & house , ; weisbrot et al . , ) , mode of governance ( navarro & shi , ) , and average educational attainment ( williamson & boehmer , ) , among others .",a substantial amount of epidemiologic research has examined the role of globalization in shaping population health at the national level .
availability of national resources and the distribution of those resources have great potential to influence population health .,"to the extent that money can finance infrastructural development , overall national income becomes an important element in this equation ."
"some evidence exists that perceived poor quality of health services leads to underutilization of these services and increased use of alternative resources ( haddad & fournier , ; segall , ) .","alternatives include traditional healers or self - medication , which may increase chances of inappropriate or insufficient treatment , possibly also encouraging drug resistance for certain pathogens ( evans et al . , ) ."
"societies with a large proportion of uninsured or underinsured individuals who cannot afford health care costs are at risk for sustained transmission of communicable diseases as well as high burdens of disability due to untreated chronic diseases ( hadley , ; institute of medicine , ) .","underinvestment in social resources at the national level is also an important predictor of population health ( davey smith , ; wagstaff , bustreo , bryce , & claeson , ) ."
"additionally , poor water quality and inadequate sewage infrastructure may create breeding sites for vectors that transport infectious disease agents ( keating et al . , ) .","lack of potable water and sewage and waste disposal facilitates the spread of infectious diseases ( world health organization , ) and increases the stress and physical strain for families ( especially women and children ) who must transport water long distances to their homes ( cosgrove & rijsberman , ; united nations , ) ."
"most commonly , unemployment rates are reported as an indication of the percentage of a nation ' s population that is unwillingly jobless .","another important element of employment is salary , with information coming from both minimum wages mandated by national law and the range and distribution of salaries in the country ."
"first , joblessness usually accompanies loss of income , which limits the purchase or attainment of necessary resources .",unemployment or part - time or seasonal employment may lead to loss of medical insurance to cover disease prevention and treatment .
"poor work environments place workers at risk for injury , respiratory disease , eure to toxins and infectious agents ( loewenson , ) .","for example , in african countries annual injury rates for occupations such as mining , forestry and transport all exceed injuries per workers ( loewenson , ) ."
more income means more resources that can be used to meet the health needs of the population .,"in reality , the association between national income growth and health is much more complex and depends on a wide array of contextual factors ."
various potential health effects of job insecurity were described in section .,"another result of volatile income growth is sudden uneected reductions in household wealth , which may result in children leaving school to join the workforce and sometimes engaging in high risk jobs such as prostitution ( cornia , ) ."
"in addition , people living in dense populations eerience higher rates of violent death ( wallace & wallace , ) and injury ( lascala , gerber , & gruenewald , ) than do less dense populations .","evidence suggests that population density may predict many health effects , including infectious diseases such as tuberculosis ( antunes & waldman , ) and acute respiratory infection ( lee , jordan , sanchez , & gaydos , ) , chronic diseases such as stomach cancer ( barker , coggon , osmond , & wickham , ) , and poor mental health ( lepore , evans , & palsane , ) ."
"crowding in situations of poor sanitation increases the spread of infectious disease through increased risk of eure to infectious agents in the environment ( krieger & higgins , ) .","in addition , populations living in crowded conditions are also often those with the fewest resources ( baum , garofalo , & yali , ) ."
"furthermore , dense populations tend to have higher rates of suicides , violent crimes , drug use and mental diseases due to social tension , competition for resources , lack of social cohesion or psychosocial stress .","urban traffic is therefore linked to increased risk of respiratory disease ( mcmichael , ) , not to mention the risk of transportation related accidents ( lascala et al . , ) ."
other nations have privatized health care such that individuals are responsible for meeting their health care needs through the private market .,even nations with privatized health care usually subsidize the costs of such services for certain members of the population ( the elderly or poor ) as in the medicare and medicaid programs of the us .
"for example , a recent study found a link among good governance measured by accountability , political stability , absence of violence , government effectiveness , regulatory quality , rule of law and the control of corruption and national hiv prevalence ( menon - johansson , ; widdus , ) economic decisions regarding resource allocation and distribution are likely to influence population health through various pathways with resounding health effects .","for example , freudenberg and colleagues describe the impact of city , state and federal budget cuts on a tb / hiv / homicide combined epidemic in new york city during the s and s , which they term a "" syndemic "" ."
we consider global - level factors to involve the processes of globalization that extend beyond national borders ( outlined in section ) .,understanding the differential effects of national - level factors on health in the global system will enhance opportunities for effective health interventions through a focus on global - level structural changes to achieve sustainable improvements in health .
"in effect , trade serves to redistribute commodities and wealth throughout the world , and it is the patterning of this redistribution and its associations with health that interests us .",exchanges of goods and services shape nations ' economies through imports and erts and levied taxes .
"for example , the transportation of aedes aegypti mosquito eggs in used tires being shipped across the oceans led to the rapid eansion of dengue virus infections worldwide ( mcmichael , ) .","indeed , a multitude of food - borne pathogens are transported globally each year ; for example , cyclospora cayetanensis in raspberries imported to the us caused an outbreak of diarrheal disease in ( centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , ) ."
"additionally , unequal distribution of resources at the community level may contribute to deterioration of the physical and social environments , which has deleterious health effects as previously discussed ( see sections and ) .",even countries eeriencing positive income growth due to trade activities on the global market may eerience poor population health outcomes if the money is not used to provide necessary social services or infrastructure development .
whether this relationship between income and health holds at the population level is less clear .,"we know that on an individual level rising income leads to better nutrition , lower child mortality , and better maternal health ( filmer & pritchett , ; pritchett & summers , ) ."
"at the global level , rising income inequality encourages migration and fosters conflict ( wade , ) .","global income distribution may shape population health through its influence on global , national , and community level factors ."
community - level characteristics may act as mediators of the health effects of income distribution as well .,"for example , navarro and shi found that countries with predominantly social democratic government traditions between and eerienced more economic growth , lower levels of income inequality and unemployment , and lower infant mortality rates than did countries with liberal or fascist government traditions ."
"at the global level , population movement facilitates spread of culture and technology , which can be beneficial for population health by eanding health knowledge and encouraging healthy behaviors ( frenk , ) .",mobility of human populations has the potential to affect health through a variety of mechanisms .
"the magnitude of morbidity and mortality due to increased infectious disease spread is likely to depend on national capacity to respond to disease outbreaks , which is a function of income , infrastructure and health knowledge and resources .","take , for example , the enhanced spread of infectious diseases facilitated by novel patterns of human to human contact , as well as by changing eco - social environments ( mcmichael , ) ."
"at the national level , changing demographics associated with mobile populations include rapid urbanization , especially in the developing world mcmichael , ; moore et al . , ) .","this phenomenon , coupled with high fertility rates , threatens population health by increasing pressures on limited national and community resources ( mcmichael , ) ."
"psychosocial stress resulting from high population densities and difficult living conditions may also seriously influence community health outcomes ( mcewen & seeman , ) .",local conflicts may also arise from competition over limited food or arable land .
"as "" the actions and means adopted by a society to promote collective action and deliver collective solutions in pursuit of common goals , "" and has typically been conceptualized at local and national levels .","as trends of globalization change our delineation of societies , the concept of governance must take on a new dimension : increasingly globalized societies need governance on a global scale ."
"however , not all nations are members of these organizations despite the fact that all nations share trans - border health risks .","these organizations are charged with defending the trade interests and health interests , respectively , of member states ."
"at the national level , income mediates the effect of global governance on population health .","as this partially predicts income distribution , governance , trade , and income are closely intertwined ."
"despite the increasing influences of these non - state actors in health decisions , the who focuses its efforts on working with ministries of health of sovereign member states .","finally , in the current era of globalization , an increasing number of non - state actors ( e . g . , ngos , private corporations , religious organizations ) may influence health governance , thereby eroding national resources for addressing health issues ( dodgson et al . , ) ."
"the scope of global communications is enormous ; in over minutes per person were spent on international telephone calls worldwide , and % of the world ' s population was covered by mobile telephony ( world bank , ) .","global communications include radio , telephone , television , and media in general , as well as the internet ."
"telephone networks provide avenues for emergency communications and foster social connections between friends and families ( berkman , glass , brissette , & seeman , ) .","enhanced global communications affects population health through the dispersion of ideas , information , knowledge and technologies ."
"media coverage of global events allows collective awareness of political , social and ecologic realities across the world .",global media also presents the potential for views and ideologies of powerful people or groups to dominate and skew the objectivity of reporting of events of global importance .
"we present simplified examples , which serve to highlight the logistical and methodological challenges , as well as the importance of including the global context in epidemiologic population health research .","in addition , one global factor may influence health outcomes via multiple pathways ."
"for example , high regional population densities have been found to be associated with greater child mortality rates in zimbabwe ( root , ) and to be predictive of cholera outbreaks in bangladesh ( myaux , ali , felsenstein , chakraborty , & de francisco , ) .",in highly populated countries these behaviors may not be sufficient to provide protection ( maybe due to high contact rates with the infectious agents ) .
"for example , for many developing countries well integrated in the global economy the - 1981 global increase in oil prices led to financial crises due to reduced trade revenues and greatly inflated debt service payments ( global health watch , ) .","according to a report by global health watch , "" many macro - economic factors that help to keep poor countries poor , by extension , keep levels of health care eenditure low . """
this illustrates how national infrastructures and health policies can influence disease spread at the community level .,"in contrast , singapore rapidly introduced strict infection control measures resulting in low numbers of secondary cases ( world health organization , ) ."
"the pathways through which community - , national - and global - level factors affect population health that are presented in our conceptual model and discussed above are far from exhaustive .","nevertheless , these examples are illustrative of the importance of context in public health research ."
"first , there is a need for identification of gaps in currently existing knowledge .","we have presented some examples as illustration , but a more systematic examination of the literature should be undertaken ."
"additionally , the data collection methods and the data themselves vary in accuracy and completeness among different countries .","data quality depends on available resources and training of data collectors , as well as on logistical obstacles to data collection ."
"although longitudinal studies can be designed to illuminate the directionality of this association , it is possible that the reality is bidirectional .","in this case , current epidemiologic methods are unable to measure the relative importance of the directions of association ."
studying the global context will enable development of effective interventions and improved promotion and protection of population health .,"we must avoid becoming "" prisoners of the proximate , "" to borrow mcmichael ' s terminology , and instead focus on identifying modifiable contextual factors likely to have a large impact on population health ."
"adherens junctions are composed of clusters of adherens molecules , such as vascular endothelial - cadherin , - catenin , and plakoglobin , linked to the actin cytoskeleton .","there are also associations with kinases , phosphatases , and growth factor receptors ."
"prior to the development of the electron microscope , there was intense debate about whether the lining of the lung was cellular or acellular .","the cytoplasmic extensions of ti cells are only to nm thick , below the resolution of conventional light microscopy ."
"this chapter reviews the functions of ti cells and tii cells , the physiologic properties of pulmonary surfactant , the use of surfactant replacement therapy in the treatment of hypoxic respiratory failure ( newborn respiratory distress syndrome [ nrds ] ) , and the role of the alveolar epithelium and surfactant in selected lung diseases .","additional discussion of the alveolar epithelium can be found in chapter , and comprehensive reviews of acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) can be found in chapter ."
"early physiologic studies demonstrated that transport of water and low - molecular - weight solutes out of the pulmonary capillaries is rapid , whereas transport of solutes out of the alveoli is extremely slow .","the anatomic basis for the barrier function of the alveolar epithelium became clear from freeze - fracture studies of the lung , 11 that demonstrated that epithelial intercellular junctions had morphologic characteristics of "" tight junctions , "" in contrast to endothelial intercellular junctions that had morphologic characteristics of gap or "" leaky "" junctions ."
these junctional complexes are each composed of different proteins that convey specific functions .,"although both tight junctions and adherens junctions associate with the actin cytoskeleton , they have somewhat different functions ; tight junctions regulate paracellular movement of ions and solutes , whereas adherens junctions mediate cellcell adhesion and participate in cell signaling ."
", there may be other differences between ti - ti and ti - tii junctions .","for example , in models of lung injury , neutrophils appear to migrate across the epithelial barrier selectively between ti and tii cells , although the molecular mechanisms responsible for this apparent selectivity are unknown ."
"it has been estimated that approximately % of unstimulated fluid transport in the lung is mediated through the subunit of na + - , k + - atpase , which is eressed in ti cells but not in tii cells .",", the pump linked to active sodium resorption is the na + - , k + - atpase ."
"in contrast , techniques to isolate and study ti cells took many years to develop because of the lack of biochemical or molecular reagents to isolate and evaluate the cells and the fragility of isolated ti cells .","until fairly recently , the accepted concept was that the ti cell was a biologically inactive , terminally differentiated cell ."
", claudin - 3 is associated with decreased barrier function , whereas claudins and are associated with increased barrier function .",the proportion of each claudin is different between the two cell types .
tii cells are highly enriched in genes involved in lipid synthesis .,", for example , tii cells can be identified in the lung by eression of two enzymes of lipid metabolism , fatty acid synthase and stearoyl coa desaturase - 1 , as well as by eression of the traditional markers such as surfactant protein ( sp ) c . lipogenesis is upregulated at the end of gestation and is regulated by the transcription factors sterol regulatory element binding protein - 1 c and ccaat / enhancer binding protein ( c / ebp ) alpha , similar to other lipogenic cells ."
tii cells can also respond to danger - associated molecular patterns ( damps ) .,"at the mrna level , human tii cells have significant eression of tlr2 , tlr3 , and tlr5 but low eression of tlr4 and tlr7 , similar to that in bronchial epithelial cells ."
surfactant is important for maintaining the patency and stabilization of small airways .,", studies in narrow fluid - filled tubes have demonstrated the critical importance of low surface tension and the need for added surfactant to reduce opening pressures ."
"fixation of the lung with osmium vapors has shown that some of the alveolar surface is covered with multilayers of phospholipids , which serve as a reservoir of surfactant to enter the film at high lung volumes .","epifluorescence studies with hydrophilic markers have shown that , as the film is compressed , there are areas from which aqueous markers are excluded ."
"newly synthesized sp - a undergoes a variety of posttranslational modifications that include proteolytic removal of the signal peptide , addition of n - linked carbohydrates , sialylation , acetylation , and sulfation .","secreted sp - a is highly glycosylated , whereas most of the intracellular form of sp - a is not ."
"directly secreted sp - a is newly synthesized , whereas the sp - a found in lamellar bodies is likely derived from recycled sp - a .",", in addition , there is secretion of sp - a contained within lamellar bodies ."
", sp - a may also be important for maintaining the function of surfactant during acute lung injury , when a variety of serum factors can inhibit surfactant function ; sp - a partially inhibits these effects .",", more than % of sp - a in lavage fluid is bound to phospholipid ."
"sp - a binds gram - negative bacteria with the rough form of lps , aggregates these bacteria , and increases phagocytosis and killing .",sp - a binds to both gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria and is thought to be an important component of host defense .
the crystal structure has revealed a hydrophobic binding pocket in the crd that likely accounts for the lipid binding properties of sp - a .,sp - a is localized primarily in the gas - exchange units of the lung and small airways .
sp - a - deficient mice are more susceptible to infection by a variety of organisms .,there are no reported genetic diseases due to the deficiency of sp - a in humans .
the monomer has an eected mass of kda and the homodimer kda .,each monomer has five amphipathic helices that interact with the surface of the monolayer but do not span the monolayer .
"the final processing of sp - b probably takes place within the multivesicular bodies , and the mature sp - b homodimer is formed by the time it arrives in the lamellar body .","in multivesicular bodies , additional proteolysis removes a - kd amino terminal peptide and a - kd carboxy terminal peptide ."
this surfactant protein is squeezed out of the monolayer at moderate film pressures ( 40 to mn / m ) and does not insert directly into the monolayer or lipid bilayers .,sp - b can convert lipid vesicles into phospholipid sheets and is likely to be important in moving lipid into the monolayer with each respiratory cycle .
"lipoglycans , especially mannosylated lipoarabinomannan , are important ligands for sp - a on mycobacteria .",sp - a also enhances the adherence and subsequent phagocytosis of mycobacteria by macrophages .
"hence , sp - a can both stimulate and inhibit inflammatory cytokine production in vitro .","it is important to recall that in vivo there is a complex interaction among sp - a , the phospholipids of surfactant , inhaled microbes , and receptors on inflammatory cells ."
"there have been several putative receptors on macrophages , including the calreticulin / cd91 complex , signalinhibitory regulatory protein , and sp - r210 .",", the major functional receptor for sp - a on tii cells is p63 ( ckap4 ) ."
"the genetic background and disease - modifying genes are , therefore , likely involved in clinical manifestations of sp - c deficiency and mutations .",some spc mutations in humans also produce a misfolded protein that accumulates and causes er stress in tii cells and a chronic interstitial lung disease .
"however , mutations in this protein and total absence can result in interstitial lung disease .",this is the one surfactant protein that is restricted to tii cells .
"sp - b is found in natural surfactant preparations , although the content may vary from batch to batch and may differ from that found in surfactant isolated from normal animals .","- 145 sp - b is secreted exclusively as a component of lamellar bodies , and lamellar body formation may depend on the ability of sp - b to organize and bind two adjacent lipid bilayers ."
this form of respiratory distress is not responsive to surfactant replacement therapy and requires lung transplantation .,"in summary , sp - b is a hydrophobic protein critical for the function of surfactant , and a total deficiency in sp - b is a cause of respiratory distress in the newborn ."
"unlike sp - b , sp - c does not appear to interact with sp - a and is not critical for the formation of tubular myelin .","sp - c is found in all preparations of natural surfactant , and a recombinant form of sp - c is used in one type of surfactant replacement therapy ."
"the knockout mouse shows an increase in the extracellular pools of surfactant and an accumulation of large foamy macrophages with excess metalloprotease activity , which results in alveolar wall destruction and subsequent air space enlargement .",the implications are that sp - d assists in clearance of surfactant and regulates macrophage function .
"in summary , sp - d is a host defense protein like mannose binding lectin and should not be considered as part of the surfactant system .",the major functions of sp - d are the clearance of heavily glycosylated viruses such as influenza and the removal of apoptotic cells .
"finally , sp - d agglutinates mycobacterium tuberculosis but inhibits its phagocytosis by human macrophages .","once in macrophages , sp - d promotes phagosome - lysosome fusion and thereby intracellular killing of mycobacteria ."
"approximately % of infants born between and weeks ( < 1700 g ) develop nrds , whereas % of infants between and weeks ( < 1500 g ) and % of those born at less than weeks ( < 1250 g ) develop this disease .",", the incidence of nrds varies with gestational age and birth weight ."
"several large clinical trials demonstrated significant improvement in gas exchange , decreased barotrauma , and decreased infant mortality in response to this therapy .","results of these trials have also shown that surfactant administered prophylactically ( i . e . , before the first breath ) is superior to surfactant given after a period of ventilation ."
"in addition to diseases involving acute alveolar inflammation , alterations in surfactant have also been characterized in various interstitial lung diseases .","decreased levels of dppc and phosphatidylglycerol , increased levels of phosphatidylinositol , and reduced levels of sp - a have been"
"although most cases of nrds result from immaturity , there are inherited forms specifically due to sp - b deficiency .","associated abnormalities include aberrantly structured tubular myelin , a decreased number of lamellar bodies , and an abnormal processing of the sp - c protein ."
"the heterozygotes , representing about in individuals in the general population , would be predicted to have about half the sp - b level and might be more susceptible to ards .","although the most common abnormality involves a - bp deletion and - bp insertion in codon in en , which results in a premature stop codon , other mutations can also lead to respiratory failure ."
"the hypothesis is that the mutations cause a misfolded sp - c protein , which accumulates and produces er stress and chronic lung disease .","the same genetic abnormality may have a variable phenotype , which indicates the importance of other disease - modifying genes ."
petty and ashbaugh recorded abnormal pressure - volume curves in lungs isolated from patients dying of ards .,early descriptions of ards suggested that surfactant abnormalities play an important role in the lung dysfunction .
"in addition , surfactant protein gene eression can be used to screen for micrometastases in lymph nodes .",measurement of sp - a and sp - d in pleural fluid might also be useful to distinguish metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung from other adenocarcinomas or mesothelioma .
the role of surfactant as a down - regulator of inflammation and the importance of surfactant in maintaining the openness of conducting airways suggest that surfactant alterations may be important in obstructive lung diseases .,", bal samples from patients with asthma showed decreased sp - a levels and a normal phospholipid composition ."
"both sp - a and sp - d are reduced in bal from patients with cystic fibrosis , and the relative deficiency could contribute to bacteria colonization .",cystic fibrosis is characterized by colonization of both gram - negative and gram - positive bacteria and early airway inflammation .
effective treatment involves removing this material through whole lung lavage and / or treatment with egenous gm - csf .,", decreased catabolism of surfactant results in an excess accumulation of multilamellated structures within the alveoli ."
a total of samples were analysed ( 1005 healthy controls and respiratory infections ) .,"samples taken during routine check - ups were positive in % of cases , while those with respiratory infection were positive in %, p < . 001 ( or : , % ci : - - - 3.8 ) ."
we conducted a prospective cohort study in newborns to analyse the association between past viral infections of varying severity and the development of recurrent wheezing .,we requested the participation of all newborns delivered in four health care centres in the rea sur health zone of madrid during their first neonatal visit ( 7 - - - 14 days of life ) .
"we considered children with specimens collected during routine well - child checkups healthy controls , even if they presented with isolated rhinorrhoea .",we defined asymptomatic infection as detection of a virus in the npa of one of these patients .
"when the requisite criteria were met , a npa sample was collected and kept at c to await transportation to the influenza and respiratory viruses laboratory of the centro nacional de microbiolog a ( national centre of microbiology ) .","in hospitalised patients , the npa sample was collected between and am of the morning following admission and kept refrigerated until it was transported ."
"a second multiplex pcr assay was used to detect parainfluenza virus ( piv ) through , coronavirus e and oc43 , enterovirus and rv .","the presence of rsv - a and b , hmpv , hbov and adenovirus ( adv ) was assessed with a third rt - nested pcr assay using the brq method ."
"we compared clinical and laboratory characteristics using the student ' s t , mann - - - whitney u , chi - square and fisher exact tests .",we have eressed discrete data as percentages and continuous data as mean and standard deviation .
"a total of , 239 samples were collected , , 005 during routine visits and when a respiratory infection was suspected .","of the samples collected during the well - child checkups , % tested positive , while viruses were detected in % of respiratory infection cases ( 224 / 288 ) , p < . 001 ( odds ratio , ; % confidence interval , - - - 3.8 ) ."
"the virus identified most frequently was rv , found in % of cases .",the frequency of viral detection in asymptomatic children ( healthy controls ) increased proportionally with age from % in newborns aged days to up to % in infants aged months .
"the mean age of infants that developed recurrent wheezing with their first positive viral detection was months ( sd , ; all but three were at least months old ) .","rhinovirus was the first virus detected in patients ( 66% ) , of who ( 52% ) were asymptomatic at the time of the specimen collection ( routine checkup ) ."
we analysed a total of hospital admissions corresponding to infants ( 14 / 302 ; % of the cohort ; % of infants with a positive viral detection ) .,five patients were admitted more than twice in the first year of life .
rhinovirus was the virus detected most frequently in symptomatic ( 43% ) as well as asymptomatic ( 25% ) infants .,"more than half of the cohort eerienced at least one symptomatic infection treated at the outpatient level , with a mean of symptomatic infections a year ( range , - - - 6 ) , while approximately % required hospital admission ."
we believe that the age of our patients ( a substantial proportion of the specimens were collected from infants aged less than months ) and our decision to include mild and asymptomatic infections with positive virology may account for the low proportion of coinfection .,"we also ought to highlight the small percentage of coinfections found in our cohort ( 8.8% ) , as other case series , including previous studies by our research group , found a percentages of coinfection of up to % in hospitalised children with rhinovirus infections ."
"the duration of followup was short , and the number of patients with recurrent wheezing small .","we did not collect weekly samples to study viral shedding and its duration , and we also did not perform genotyping of rv ."
antisense technology presents an opportunity to manipulate gene eression within cells to treat an endless number of diseases and is a powerful tool for studying gene function .,"the antisense approach utilizes antisense agents to fight various diseases by regulating the eression of a specific factor , the presence of which actually causes that particular disease ."
gene silencing also has a great potential as a chemosensitizing agent to overcome the difficulties of drug resistance and dose - limiting toxicities of chemotherapeutic agents .,"thus , these are being extensively elored for personalized therapy of cancer , hiv , and other mutating viral diseases ."
"introduction of - to - nucleotidelong sirna could exhibit antiviral activity by blocking the eression of viral proteins , which led to the progress of sirna in therapeutics to block the production of disease - related proteins .","they are a natural cellular defense mechanism , by virtue of which the presence of double - stranded viral dna triggers the mrna degradation ."
"several modifications such as novel bases , sugars , conjugates , and chimeric technology have been tried to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these oligonucleotides [ 11 , , .","compared to that of whole dna or rna , today rnai is achieved using sirna , dsrna ( double - stranded rna ) , and shrna ( short hairpin rna ) ."
"until recently , triple - strand formation has been the most commonly used strategy to induce transcriptional arrest .",triple strands are formed by involving watson - crick hydrogen bonds between the third strand and the complementary strand of dna duplex .
the barriers encountered by naked oligonucleotides and sirna are different from those encountered by the ones associated with various nanocarriers .,. 2 ) often impede delivery of as odns and sirna to their site of action .
"further , - oh modifications , locked nucleic acids ( lnas ) , pnas , morpholino compounds , and hexitol nucleic acids ( hnas ) can also improve mrna stability toward nucleases .",the substitution of sulfur for oxygen to form phosphorothioate oligonucleotides is the most common chemical modification to improve stability toward the nucleases .
"also , oligonucleotides smaller than nm ( 70 kd in molecular weight ) undergo rapid clearance from the body through glomerular filtration .","the large uptake of antisense agents by tissues with fenestrated vasculature , liver , and spleen can be beneficial while targeting such molecules to these tissues ."
"the endothelial cells tightly adhere to the underlying extracellular matrix via integrins and to each other via several adhesion molecules , forming tight intercellular junctions with very small intercellular spaces .","the endothelial cells that line the vascular lumen present a barrier to the as odnbased therapy , as the oligonucleotides need to cross the endothelium before being delivered to the tissue parenchymal cells ."
coating with peg not only reduces uptake by the res but also reduces uptake by target cells .,"hence , it is more rational to use cell - specific targeting ligands along with peg coating ."
"interaction of the cationic lipids of these liposomes with the anionic lipids of the cell membranes ( endosomal membrane ) results in phase separation , thereby creating dope - rich regions that form pores in the membranes , causing membrane destabilization .","a ph - sensitive liposome system , such as lipofectin , composed of cationic lipids along with a fusogenic helper lipid such as dope ( 1,2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ) , has been reported , which readily releases the entrapped oligonucleotides at low - ph environments ."
this release is attributed to the multivalent nature of the anionic lipid and the electrostatic and hydrophilic - hydrophobic interactions of the lipids .,addition of an anionic lipid can displace negatively charged sirna or as odn from the cationic lipid - polymer - oligonucleotide complex .
"hence , the lipid / polymer - to - oligonucleotide ratio must be optimized to achieve maximum inhibition of mrna eression .",inclusion of tissue - specific promoters can be tried to inhibit mrna eression within the therapeutic window .
"when phosphorothioates were administered to monkeys as a large , one - time injection , they triggered a systemic and lethal inflammation by activating complement .",many researchers have reported dangerous immune responses with as odns .
"in the first step , the sense strand of the dna is transcribed into a pre - mrna .","in the second , the pre - mrna is converted into a mature mrna via the simultaneous action of three separate processes viz ."
"however , the favored design is to use chimeric molecules , such as a single ribonucleotide , which can be bound to its complementary oligonucleotide backbone , which then serves as a substrate for rnase h .",these rnase h - dependent oligonucleotides can inhibit protein eression by binding to any region of the complementary mrna .
"capping is an essential step in the protein synthesis cascade , stabilizing and translating an mrna into a mature polypeptide sequence .","although this is an effective mechanism of inhibiting mrna translation , it is not an established mechanism of action of as odns due to the inaccessibility of the end of mrna to capping ."
splicing is an important and specific step in the translation of an mrna to a protein and requires spliceosomes .,"the as odns act by binding to specific splicing sequence of mrna , thereby inhibiting its translation and the production of related protein ."
translational arrest has been reported to be a mechanism of action to inhibit replication of viruses like hiv and vesicular stomatitis virus .,pnas and morpholino - oligonucleotides have been reported to act via translational arrest by binding to the translational initiation codon or - utr .
capping of the - terminal of pre - mrna could inhibit polyadenylation and destabilize it .,"however , to date no study reports polyadenylation as a mechanism of action for antisense drugs ."
other rna - processing events such as nuclear splicing and polyadenylation are also inhibited by steric blockade of mrna .,pnas and morpholino - oligonucleotides have been reported to inhibit mrna translation by steric blockade .
"the potency , maximal effectiveness , duration of action , and sequence specificity of sirna oligonucleotide duplexes have been found to be comparable to those of rnase h - dependent oligonucleotides .","also , the activity of sirna oligonucleotides has been found to be affected by the secondary structure of the target mrna ."
the process of rnai is activated by eure to dsrna precursors .,"in the initiation step , in the presence of atp and rnase - iii - type endonucleases , the dsrna precursors are processed into smaller nucleotides called sirnas having length from to nucleotides ."
"as odns , ribozymes , aptamers , and sirna are the available techniques to achieve suppression or elimination of a genetic message related to a particular disease .","to date , a broad array of disease targets have been elored utilizing various antisense agents ."
"this modification was primarily tried to improve the stability of as odns toward nucleases , but phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were found to be cytotoxic at high concentrations by binding nonspecifically to certain proteins .",phosphorothioate oligonucleotides are the most widely studied oligonucleotides and were the first to be synthesized chemically .
"these oligonucleotides were designed to address issues like nonspecific protein binding and cytotoxicity associated with phosphorothioate as odns , and they are more resistant to nucleases than phosphorothioates .","however , the major drawbacks associated with these oligonucleotides are their poor elimination properties and rnase h - independent antisense mechanism of action ."
a gapmer contains a central block of deoxynucleotides sufficient to induce rnase h cleavage flanked by blocks of - o - methylmodified ribonucleotides that protect the internal block from nuclease degradation .,these as odns have increased thermal stability in hybridization and enhanced target recognition but do not support rnase h activity .
these are biologically stable and possess efficient antisense activity that is rnase h independent .,these are comparatively less toxic than first - or second - generation oligonucleotides and show low interaction with plasma proteins .
aptamers are acquiescent to the amendments that apply to the other nucleotide - based antisense agents .,"thus , aptamers can be tailored according to various required modifications while safeguarding their structure , specifically , the binding region ."
sirna and oligonucleotides both are being extensively elored for therapeutic targeting and have their own pros and cons .,sirna is a - to - nucleotide long dsrna that triggers cellular rnai for degradation of the complementary mrna in the cytoplasm and required sequence - specific translational arrest .
"mammalian cells have single - stranded rna , and the introduction of viral long dsrna ( nt ) can trigger rnai and initiate a potent antiviral response by inhibition of protein synthesis through mrna degradation .",rnai is more potent than antisense in general and makes selection of a candidate sequence much easier .
"initially , the studies were limited to local administration of sirna for the the mechanism involves sequential cleavage of long dsrna by the enzyme dicer rnase iii into sirnas , which are then incorporated into a complex termed risc to target the degradation of mrna transcript .","since , many studies have been executed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of sirna , and pharmaceutical industries have invested billions on this technology through licensing delivery platforms and strategic alliances in the development of rnai - based therapeutic products ."
"the dicer enzyme cuts away the loop , forming the mature doublestranded mirna .","the drosha enzyme cuts the hairpin from the rest of the transcript , forming pre - mirna ."
mirnas are encoded in the genome and are naturally used by cells to regulate gene eression .,"sirnas , on the other hand , are the affector molecules of the rnai pathway and are generated from the cleavage of dsrna ."
"to achieve this , it is essential to understand the in vivo effect of these molecules .","however , traditional antisense and novel sirna oligonucleotides or mirna all typically need chemical modifications and formulation into clinically suitable , safe , and effective drug delivery vehicles for stability and tissue targeting ."
"however , because the pharmacokinetics of oligonucleotides has been reported to be sequence independent , data from one sequence can be used to understand pharmacokinetics of the entire class .",the development of various sensitive analytical methods to selectively quantify oligonucleotides in biological systems has made it possible to study the metabolism of these compounds easily .
"sirnas often perfectly correspond to the sequences of known or predicted mrnas , transposons , or regions of heterochromatic dna .",mirnas rarely correspond perfectly to the sequences of mrnas targets and are derived from loci distinct from those of their mrna targets .
"immediately following intravenous administration , % of the as odn degrades within min .","in tissue metabolism , the metabolites , being smaller , excrete more slowly than the parent oligonucleotide ."
"these oligonucleotides have also been reported to bind to other plasma proteins as well , but with lower affinity , and binding of the ps oligonucleotides to the thrombin - binding sites of these plasma proteins results in severe hematological risks .",the ps oligonucleotides have been reported to bind to - macroglobuline with higher affinity than albumin .
"the antisense agents can be administered through oral , nasal , rectal vaginal , pulmonary , topical , intravenous , subcutaneous , intradermal , or intrathecal routes [ 135 , , , .","local delivery is advantageous over systemic administration as it avoids distribution into nontarget tissues , resulting in reduced side effects associated with unwanted tissue distribution ."
this requires suborgan distribution of the oligonucleotides to the target cells and subcellular distribution to the binding site in target mrna .,the onset and duration of antisense activity decides the dose of as odn and its frequency of administration .
"thus , the size requirement for systemic delivery of these delivery systems is about nm .","simultaneously , it should be greater than nm , to avoid leakage to interstitial spaces of hepatic sinusoid and entrapment by hepatic kuffer cells ; but smaller than nm , to avoid uptake by organs of the res , such as the liver and spleen ."
"a viral vector usually consists of a viral genome with deletions in some or all essential genes , into which a transgene is inserted .",viral vectors provide high tissue specificity and result in highly efficient oligonucleotide eression .
"these vectors require integration into the host genome , resulting in a sustained eression of vector .","hence , replication defective vectors are used for transducing the host cells ."
such vectors can infect a cell only once and can infect both dividing and nondividing cells .,the e1a region is essential for the replication of these viruses .
these vectors cannot incorporate oligonucleotides larger than kb but are capable of infecting multiple types of cells .,"these can infect both dividing and resting cells , with site - specific integration into the host genome , and so they possess low mutagenic potential ."
cationic lipids / polymers and cell - penetrating peptides are commonly used to design these delivery vectors ( table . 6 ) .,"along with the chemical modifications , the conjugation and / or incorporation of targeting ligands like peptides , monoclonal antibodies , and so on , are essential to achieve the desired therapeutic effect ."
this system has been reported to improve the diseased state in tumor - bearing mice .,"this is a threecomponent system comprising a cyclodextrin - containing polymer ( cdp ) , peg as a steric stabilization agent , and human transferrin ( tf ) as a targeting ligand ."
"polypeptides , such as pll , protamine , histone , and so on , have been used to precondense odns to form polyplexes that are then coated with a lipid layer to form a lipid - polymer hybrid system [ 162 , .","these include odns precondensed with polycations and then coated with either cationic or anionic lipids , or amphiphilic polymers with or without helper lipids ."
a poly [ 1 - vinyl - 2 - pyrrolidinone - co - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl methacrylate ) ] hydrogel has been reported as a potential carrier for as odns .,antisense activity of oligonucleotides immobilized in a cationic crosslinked poly ( ethylene oxide ) ( peo ) and pei nanogel has been evaluated in a cell model .
"the method is simple , reproducible , and highly efficient , with transfection efficiency dependent on the anatomy of the target organ , the injection volume , and the injection rate .","being nonspecific , hydrodynamic delivery can be used for intracellular delivery of any water - soluble compounds , small colloidal particles , or even viruses ."
treatment of tissue with hyaluronidase prior to injection of as odns may significantly enhance transfection due to improved distribution of odns within the tissue .,the technique has been reported to successfully deliver phosphorothioate - modified odns against c - myc proto - oncogene of u937 cells and fluorescein - labeled as odns to the promoters of the proto - oncogene c - myb ( 24 - mer ) transdermally .
"the ultrasound creates pores in the cellular membrane , facilitating passive diffusion of odns across the membrane .","the transfection efficiency is dependent on the size and local concentration of odns , and better transfection is obtained when complexes of onds with cationic lipids are used ."
"also , human mesenchymal stem cells are inevitable as a viable nonimmunogenic cellular delivery system .","in addition to that , repeated branched dendritic structures , specifically polycationic dendrimers , can bind strongly with oligonucleotides / sirna for better nuclease resistance and efficient gene silencing ."
"the potential of as odns and sirna has been investigated for applications through different routes , for example , the skin , lungs , and mucosal membranes like intravaginal , ocular , and nasal , and various systemic delivery routes .","furthermore , there are some recent papers reporting the study of sirna delivery through oral route for targeting macrophages ."
"some ocular diseases can be treated by intravitreal injection of antisense agents to treat eye diseases like amd , inhibition of ocular neurovascularization , and angiogenesis .","further , intrathecal injection of antisense agents have been elored for cns delivery for a number of applications like knockdown of serotonin transporters in mice brain , treatment of various diseases like chronic neuropathic pain , and formalin - induced nociception ."
many efforts have been made in previous and ongoing research to judicially modify antisense agents and to develop an effective formulation for the desired application .,"as discussed earlier , systemic administration of sirna and as odns is a big challenge , because they have to cross many obstacles on the way to the target ."
"antisense technology can potentially be applied to treat various diseases , especially viral infections and cancers .","however , with rapid progress in antisense technology , the technique has found newer applications to treat several other infections , which we discuss here in detail ."
"however , oligonucleotides must not activate rnase h enzyme when used to alter these splicing patterns .",blocking of these splice sites using as odns thus prevents inappropriate protein eression .
"phosphorothioate oligonucleotides , though having good stability in csf and producing the desired antisense effect , are quite toxic .",as odns exert their inhibitory effect through rnase h mechanisms in the brain .
advances in research concerning alzheimer ' s disease and myasthenia gravis have demonstrated alternative splicing variants of acetyl cholinesterase enzyme being involved in the etiology of these diseases .,"thus , only as odn therapy could be useful in the management of these diseases ."
"hence , this technology is useful both in defining the role of a particular mediator in the process of inflammation and in the screening of potential anti - inflammatory drugs .","in inflammation , antisense technology can be used to demonstrate the relative importance of various signaling components at the molecular level in a controlled manner ."
"these rasons can deliver antisense medicines effectively and safely , even to deep lungs , by interacting with the unique pulmonary surfactant of alveolar epithelial cells , resulting in enhanced cellular uptake of the oligonucleotides .","for the treatment of various diseases of the respiratory tract , novel respirable antisense drugs called rasons are used ."
phosphorothioates were the first as odns to be used in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of bladder cancer .,"since then , several antisense drugs have been investigated for various cancers like colon cancer , lymphatic leukemia , lung cancer , testicular cancer , and lymphoma ."
vitravene ( fomivirsen ) was the first antiviral as odn used intravitreally to treat cytomegalovirus retinitis .,"antisense technology can be easily applied to viruses as they encode unique proteins , very different from the ones encoded by normal cells ."
viral proteins essential for the replication of viruses are the prime targets of these antisense drugs .,"as odns , being selective and specific , readily bind to the target mrna sequence , thereby downregulating the eression of related proteins and causing the death of the virus ."
this opens up enormous possibilities for using these as potential drug candidates .,antisense molecules that mediate rnai can be synthesized chemically in the laboratory and then introduced into cells to achieve targeted gene silencing .
"however , sirna therapy does not allow the formation of disease - causing elements and hence acts to remove the root cause of the disease .",l most of the drugs act for the symptomatic relief of the disease by inhibiting the diseasecausing factor .
"thus , a drug effective at a particular time will not be effective for the next viral mutation .","sirna can be designed according to the particular gene mutation ; moreover , a pool of more than one mutant - specific sirna can be incorporated in a single delivery agent for delivering at one time ."
they should be followed while developing antisense formulations in order to achieve regulatory approval and gain entry to the antisense therapeutic market .,presented here are some rules and conventions based on the practical understanding of sirna design and delivery performance .
"several sirnas or shrnas should give the same phenotypic outcome , but similar off - target effects can be achieved with a pool of different triggers .",it is critical to correlate this phenotypic outcome with the effectiveness of suppression .
"thus , sirna concentration should be titrated to have a correlation between degree of suppression and phenotype outcome .","in fact , % of the suppression of the eression has been observed in some sirnas , for example , in the hela cell at a very low concentration of pm ."
final effectiveness of formulation can be predicted on the basis of specifications designed for a particular formulation .,"to augment the triumph of final formulation , many companies like sirna therapeutics have revealed some specifications ."
there should be more than a fivefold window between ic of target gene silencing and ic for reduction in viability .,but control sirna at a concentration of nm in media containing % serum should reduce target mrna levels less than %.
"a comparison of a single intravenous dose at , , and mg / kg for target sirna - containing delivery assemblies with control should be provided .",in vivo performance of the sirna - containing delivery assemblies should be evaluated in suitable animal models .
"at present , the focus of antisense research is toward delivering an adequate amount in the right cells at the right time through an appropriate sirna design and labeling it with suitable delivery system .","the trend in the patents is toward gene silencing , preparation techniques for judicious design , and modifications to improve specificity , nuclease resistance , transfection efficiency , and targeting of the molecules ."
"thus , these features should be sincerely evaluated through specialized distribution of antisenseoriented research to various respected companies , industries , and institutes .","simplicity of sirna design , its specificity , potency , availability of human genome information , feasibility of fabrication into required sequence , and applications for an endless number of disease - related eressions offers the broadest application in almost every area of therapeutics ."
viral replication machinery is assembled on these platforms as a supramolecular complex and ptdins4p lipids regulate viral rna synthesis .,"they use pi4k to generate membranes enriched in phosphatidylinositide - phosphate ( ptdins4p or pi4p ) lipids , which can be used as replication platforms ."
"once inside the host cell , viral pathogens need to initiate replication as quickly and efficiently as possible .","this is a kinetically challenging problem : the first few synthesized viral replication proteins have to find each other and assemble into a replication complex that can replicate the viral genome , all while in a hostile cellular environment that has vast excesses of host proteins and nucleic acids ."
"these viruses generate discrete membrane platforms highly enriched in ptdins4p lipids for replication , and they achieve this by selectively recruiting host pi4ks ( box ) to phosphorylate ptdins lipids within membranes ( figure ) .",remarkably different rna viruses eloit both common and distinct mechanisms by which to hijack host pi4ks to generate ptdins4p - enriched replication platforms .
"the n - terminal ~ 1400 amino acids of pi4kiii has a pro - rich sequence most proximal to the n terminus , then several leu - rich regions and putative nuclear localization and nuclear ert signals .","in pi4kiii ( figure ia ) , a putative ph - domain is sandwiched between the lku and catalytic domains ."
"the solution structure of frq1 with the n - terminal frq1 - binding region of pik1 shows a helical conformation of the pik1 peptide , and it was suggested that frq binding keeps pik1 in a closed conformation .","for pi4kiii and its yeast homolog pik1p ( figure ib ) , the lku domain is followed by the frequenin / neuronal calcium sensor - 1 ( fq / ncs - 1 ) binding site ."
type ii pi4ks are smaller proteins with a kinase domain that shows little sequence homology with those of the type iii enzymes ( figure ic ) .,"their kinase domain contains two stretches that are highly conserved from yeast to man , separated by an insert that is longer in the yeast and drosophila melanogaster orthologue ."
"plus strand rna viruses make up a large fraction of animal and plant pathogenic viruses , have a significant health and economic impact , and include many notable human pathogens such as pv , hcv , rhinovirus , west nile virus ( wnv ) , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) virus and chikungunya virus .","ptdins4p - enriched replication platforms were first observed within host cells infected with either pv or coackievirus b3 ( cvb3 ) , which are both plus strand rna viruses of the genus enterovirus within picornaviridae ."
"later , at peak of replication kinetics ( ~ 4 hrs post infection ) , the growing pool of viral replication proteins and viral rna are found on membrane - bound organelles adjacent to er exit sites ( figure ; hrs ) .","within the first ~ hours of pv or cvb3 infection the replication proteins , translated from the original infecting viral rna , localize to the golgi and tgn compartments and commence viral rna synthesis ."
"membrane bound arf1 - gtp can recruit a diverse array of effectors , including membrane coat proteins copi and clathrin ; cytosokeletal regulators ; and lipid modifying enzymes such as phospholipase d and pi4kiii .","the arf1 - gdp / gtp switch is controlled by guanosine exchange factors and gtpase activating proteins such as gbf1 and arfgap1 , respectively ."
"both arf1 and gbf1 not only colocalize with enteroviral replication machinery but arf1 can bind and hydrolyze gtp throughout the infection period , suggesting the virus can utilize arf1 effectors to gain access to a wide range of host activities .","a systematic search for arf1 effectors that localize to enteroviral replication platforms yielded a surprising finding : although pi4kiii levels on viral replication membranes gradually rose , many other arf1 effectors , notably the coat proteins copi and clathrin , were progressively lost ."
"when the cvb3 a protein was eressed ectopically at low levels in mammalian cells , it localized to the golgi / tgn and enhanced the recruitment of pi4kiii to those membranes by ~ 300% while decreasing the coat protein levels at those membranes b % compared to control cells .","increasing ectopic eression of protein a caused complete golgi disassembly and the de novo biogenesis of organelles adjacent to er exit sites that were devoid of coats but contained a , pi4kiii , gbf1 - arf1 and ptdins4p lipids ."
"depleting ptsins4p at these sites , by either blocking pi4kiii kinase activity pharmacologically or by converting ptdins4p back to ptdins through ectopic eression of sac1 phosphatase ( figure ) , potently inhibits viral rna synthesis , pointing to a critical role for ptdins4p lipids themselves in replication .","given their small volume , the increase in ptdins4p lipid concentration is likely even greater at the replication platforms than the six - fold increase observed in whole cells ."
"testing the effects of different enteroviral proteins on pi4kiii activity using cell - free , liposome - based phosphorylation assays will shed light on this question .","alternatively , pi4k activity could be directly stimulated by viral machinery , as is the case with hcv ( see below ) ."
"the golgi / tgn is generated and maintained in cells by membrane trafficking between the plasma membrane , endosomes , tgn , golgi apparatus and er compartments .","coat proteins are in part responsible for the trafficking , by facilitating the sorting and sequestration of cargo ."
"subsequently , the er membrane replication platforms of cells infected with hcv were shown to be highly enriched in ptdins4p lipids , and the total cellular levels of ptdins4p lipids were > fold higher than the levels in uninfected cells .","within liver biopsies from hcv infected individuals , high levels of ptdins4p were observed in infected cells relative to uninfected cells ."
"specifically the hcv ns5a protein , which is a component of the replication complex and required for rna synthesis , was found to interact with pi4kiii and stimulate its kinase activity in vitro .",hcv was reported to enhance ptdins4p lipid production through both recruitment as well as direct activation of host pi4ks .
aichi virus was first isolated in a gastroenteritis outbreak in in japan and has since become a causative agent for gastroenteritis outbreaks across the globe .,"like the other viruses discussed , aichi virus generates replication organelles with membranes that are highly enriched in pi4kiii and ptdins4p lipids ( figure , kobuvirus ) ."
"recently enviroxime compounds , which block replication of rhinovirus , rubella and theiler ' s murine encephalomyeitis virus infections , were shown to target pi4kiii .","finally , a proteins from bovine kobuvirus and rhinovirus have also been shown to complex with pi4kiii ."
plus strand viral rna replication consists of two critical processes of viral rna translation and viral rna synthesis .,"the translated replication machinery produce more rna , which is then either translated or packaged into virions ."
"in addition to protein - protein interactions , we conjecture that binding to ptdins4p lipids and / or partitioning into ptdins4p - rich domains may facilitate the membrane attachment and concentration of soluble and transmembrane viral proteins to form a functional replication complex ( figure ) .",the question arises : by what mechanisms do ptdins4p lipids regulate picornaviral or hepaciviral rna synthesis ?
"identification of the ptdins4p - binding domain sequence of rdrp may also help uncover other viral , prokaryotic and eukaryotic ptdins4p binding proteins .","thus , understanding the mechanisms by which ptdins4p regulates viral rna synthesis may help elucidate roles of ptdinsps in mammalian rna metabolism ."
enrichment for ptdins4p lipids could allow the virus to harness host proteins to modulate lipid content and membrane shape at the platforms resulting in complex membrane curvature that could potentially drive the sorting and sequestration of viral proteins and rna for optimal rna synthesis as well as protecting them from host innate immune defenses .,high - resolution electron microscopy ( em ) studies of enteroviral and dengue replication organelles revealed that replication platforms have a highly complex d organization that has many positive and negative curvature domains .
"in the case of enteroviruses and aichi virus , hijacking pi4kiii through the host acbd3 protein may function to link viral elements to a whole network of host machinery : acbd3 has been implicated to serve as a hub connecting many host signaling pathways and cellular lipid - and ion - homeostatic mechanisms , including cholesterol synthesis and trafficking , iron metabolism , protein kinase a signaling and nuclear traffic .","pi4kiii also binds the calcium sensor ncs - 1 , which can regulate ion channels , phosphatases and g - protein coupled receptors ."
"finally , ptdins4p lipids have been implicated in regulating trafficking of some cargo through the secretory and endocytic pathways and are also precursors for the production of ptdinsp , a crucial plasma membrane lipid involved in a multitude of host signaling pathways .","it remains to be determined what impact , if any , high ptdins4p lipid levels have on host signaling and trafficking pathways in persistent picornaviral or hepaciviral infections ."
"this may be possible if the host target belongs to a family of proteins that have identical activities , because it could then be redundant .","this problem could be circumvented by targeting host components that host cells can , for a period of time , survive without ."
"thus , it is possible that when pi4kiii is inhibited , these other pi4k isoforms can provide ptdins4p to the golgi / tgn .","however , the question then arises as to why picornaviruses do not also compensate through these other kinases when pi4kiii is inhibited ."
"individuals can be infected with multiple different rna viruses at any given time ; recombination among these viruses can occur , leading to the generation of potent viruses that are potentially resistant to vaccines generated against either parent virus .","for instance , a recent poliomyelitis outbreak in madagascar was attributed to the recombination between circulating vaccine - derived pv and a coackievirus strain ."
"note that each batch of microbeads was attached with only one type of capture probe , which was complementary to a part of a particular target dna ( that is , sample dna to be detected ) .",the first set ( capture probes ) was biotin labeled and immobilized onto avidin - functionalized microbeads .
"chemical cross - linked dendritic dna or backbone - branched oligonucleotides , ) , to our knowledge no one else has demonstrated successful multiplexed detection using dna nanobarcodes , whose fluorescence intensity ratios were precisely controlled at an individual molecular level ; at present such tight control of color - conjugations can be achieved only with anisotropic , multivalent carriers , such as dl - dna .","in addition , the dna scaffold makes our nanobarcodes biocompatible and thus has the potential to be applied in vivo after solving degradation problems ."
"in addition , this technique could also substitute both isotope and fluorochrome labeling for blotting - based , multiplexed detection without resorting to multiple runs or repeated probe stripping , as practiced at present .","the use of common and commercially available fluorophores does not require special equipment for detection , effectively eanding the power of traditional microscopy ."
"in summary , we have developed a dl - dna - based nanobarcode technology , whose applications have been demonstrated in fluorescence microscopy , dot blotting and flow cytometry .","the technology has the following advantages : ( i ) dna , in particular the dl - dna , can be used as both a structural scaffolding and a functional probe ; ( ii ) multiplexed molecular sensing relies on the detection of precise fluorescent color ratios instead of the detection of single colors ; and ( iii ) the dna - based , multiplexed sensing platform nanotechnology can be applied to almost any fluorescence - based detection system ."
"briefly , mg of streptavidincoated polystyrene microbead suspension was washed with ml of ttl buffer ( 100 mm tris - hcl , ph , 1% tween , m licl ) and resuspended in ml of ttl .",one picomole of biotin - modified capture probes was then mixed with the microbead suspension and incubated at c with gentle agitation for min .
around ml of concentrated bead suspension was added onto a glass slide .,a cover slip was glued onto the glass slide using nail polish .
"the microbeads used for flow cytometer analysis were purposely prepared nonuniformly in terms of the number of target dna bound to each microbead ( since only a small amount of target dna was used , microbeads were far from saturation in terms of nanobarcode binding ) .","bead - probe conjugates , along with a sample containing ' unknown ' dna target ( s ) and nanobarcodes were added into ml of hybridization buffer individually without mixing to achieve a nonuniform nanobarcode binding ."
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus ( sars - cov - 2 ) was identified as the pathogen of covid - [ 1 e3 ] .,"corona virus disease ( covid - ) , which was reported from wuhan city , hubei province of china , has caused over , 000 human infections and more than deaths ( as of february , ) ."
its genome is a single - stranded rna composed of about kb nucleotides .,"belonging to the subgenus sarbecvirus of coronaviridae , both sars - cov - 2 and sars - cov are human sars - related coronavirus ( sarsr - cov ) ."
the specificity of the interaction between virus and receptor determines the host tropism and host range .,the origin of sars - cov - 2 is presumed to be bat .
phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses of ace2 were conducted using mega version x .,"based on the known key sites in sars - cov s protein interacting with human ace2 , we analyzed whether these sites were conserved on ace2 from wild mammals and domestic pets ."
the interaction interfaces of sarsr - cov s and ace2 from cat / dog / pangolin / chinese hamster were simulated by chimera software ver 4 .,the simulation were based on the structures of hace2 with sars - cov s rbd ( pdb : ajf ) and hace2 with sars - cov - 2 s rbd ( pdb : lzg ) .
this founding suggested that circetidae mammals could be developed as sarsr - cov small animal models .,"we found that four members of circetidae including mesocricetus auratus , phodopus campbelli , ictidomys tridecemlineatus , and cricetulus griseus remained the key residues for association with s protein from sars - cov and sars - cov - 2 , though two members of muridae ( rattus norvegicus , mus musculus ) could not bind to s protein ."
"all the three human coronaviruses originated from bats , but the intermediate hosts were different .","sars - cov is believed to come from the paguma larvata , and the intermediate host of mers - cov is camelus dromedaries ."
ace2 contains at least five key amino acids critical for binding s protein of sarsr - cov .,"s protein of sars - cov - 2 interacts with human ace2 , which promotes the entry of sars - cov - 2 , indicating that human ace2 is the receptor of sars - cov - 2 ."
"in the context of global environmental changes , the transmission characteristics of the covid - 19 epidemic have not yet been sufficiently recognized ( cdc , ) .","the covid - 19 epidemic directly threatens the achievement of the above goals for health , and also affects the realization of goals for economic and social development ."
"on february , the local government took the measure of receiving and curing all patients that should be treated , following which the epidemic in hubei province reached a turning point and began to decline .","during this period , we utilized gis and spatial big data technology , which have a high degree of scientific and technological display ( zhou et al . , ) , to provide important scientific and technical support to allow the government to judge the epidemic situation and formulate prevention and control measures ( health commission of hubei province , ) ."
"during december , a cluster of unelained viral pneumonia cases was detected in wuhan city , hubei province , china .","the covid - 19 epidemic subsequently spread to the rest of hubei , and to other parts of china ."
"after february , the number of newly confirmed cases in the areas outside hubei province gradually decreased .","by february , the number of newly confirmed cases in hubei province had increased by one hundred people per day ."
"the characteristics of strong infectivity , a long incubation period and uncertain detection of covid - 19 , combined with the background of large - scale population flow and other factors , led to the urgent need for scientific and technological support to control and prevent the spread of the epidemic .","during the struggle against epidemic , gis and spatial big data technology have played an important role in identifying the spatial transmission of the epidemic , in spatial prevention and control of the epidemic , in spatial allocation of resources , and in spatial detection of social sentiment , among other things ."
the system interfaces at different scales are shown in figure .,"considering that decision - making in regard to epidemic prevention and control requires rapid analysis of the spatiotemporal dynamics and comprehensive consideration of multiple geographical scales , the systems development teams have ) connected health departments and the internet to build a virtual perception network of multi - source spatiotemporal big data about the epidemic , and developed gis for the epidemic from a daily time scale , which is a relatively static information system , into real - time dynamic gis on hourly or even minute - by - minute timescales ; ) built a spatiotemporal cube model of big data about the epidemic , and realized the normalized modeling of multi - source heterogeneous data with different spatial references , different times , different scales and different semantics , as well as creating a unified storage system and management of mixed polymorphic data ; ) set up a computing engine for epidemic description , diagnosis , prediction and decision - making , and developed the traditional online gis for epidemics with the "" visualizing query "" function to an integrated stage with "" visualization query analysis "" ; ) developed a multi - scale integrated spatiotemporal dynamic visualization technology to visualize the epidemic at the "" country , province , city , county , community , and individual "" scales in order to manage visualization analysis on "" one map "" of multidimensional epidemic data under a unified spatiotemporal datum ; ) adopted the new generation of native cloud architecture technology to develop a three - tier structure consisting of the infrastructure as the background , a platform for spatiotemporal big data management as the middle ground , and application for the epidemic as the foreground , which solved problems caused by traditional information systems , such as overfull links in development mode , complex processing and long lead time , and satisfied the demand for rapid construction of gis for an epidemic in an emergency ."
"the development and application of big data will undoubtedly contribute to quickly identifying the spatiotemporal process of epidemic development , prevention and control measures , and the resulting effectiveness .",the decisions and actions of large - scale epidemic prevention and control depend on data support .
"esri ' s eert kenneth field appealed that coronavirus mapping should be responsible ( field , ) .","he called attention to misunderstandings in the current covid - 19 epidemic maps , including the incorrect use of map projections , choropleth maps , classification schemes , color schemes , point density maps , graduated symbols , heat maps , and three - dimensional maps ."
daily animation maps were applied to eress the spatiotemporal characteristics of the spread of the epidemic .,the knowledge mapping method com - bined with the epidemiological and emergency response - related professional knowledge were also utilized further .
the comparison of activity tracks between patients and populations provides an important scientific basis for delimiting the potentially infected population .,the comparison of the spatial track of the patient ' s activities is a critical technical task for virus tracking and transmission chain reconstruction .
this research conducted a spatial simulation from the perspective of the geographical environment and social space .,"the spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases in large populations is a very large and complex system that poses great challenges to mathematical modeling ( grassly and fraser , ; riley , ) ."
"a risk assessment model was constructed with the spatial distribution of the number of confirmed cases and the population migration , and three risk level areas were outlined on the regional scale and on the urban scale for the cities with high risks of epidemics , including beijing , shenzhen , guangzhou , shanghai , chongqing , wenzhou , zhuhai , changsha and harbin .","however , after the spring festival , the epidemic risk had a high probability of increasing due to the return flow ."
"the spatial distribution of medical resources is generally balanced according to factors such as population density , but the spatially uneven outbreak of the epidemic and their rapid development result in a spatiotemporal imbalance of the supply and demand for medical resources .","in this case , the key to epidemic prevention and control is knowing the spatiotemporal dynamics of the supply and demand for medical resources to optimize the allocation of materials ."
a stable and efficient national material supply and transportation system provides important support for successful epidemic prevention and control .,"we have integrated multiple datasets , such as provincial epidemic data , online consumption data and postal service data , to analyze the supply - demand situation and price changes in necessities and food , including vegetables and meat , for every province during the epidemic prevention period , as well as the changing volume and trends of postal and eress delivery businesses in each region , to identify the area , type , and the transportation support capacity of the material short - age risks ."
research has shown a strong relationship between the number of train journeys and the number of covid - 19 cases .,"before the lockdown of wuhan on january , , more than five million people had left wuhan to other regions in china ( news china , ) ."
"however , figure shows that population mobility has increased since february ( the th of the first lunar month of ) .",the return of people to work will possibly increase the spread of covid - 19 .
"with the goal of modelling and visualizing the semantic and spatiotemporal evolution of public opinion on covid - 19 , a topic extraction and classification framework for extracting topics of a covid - 19 - related microblogs was designed and implemented .","the sina weibo , which is similar to twitter , is the social media platform on which chinese people typically share their opinions ."
"this situation requires gis and big data technology to allow rapid responses and analyses , a quick supply of information about the epidemic dynamics and an understanding of the epidemic development rules to provide timely support for the prevention and control decisions and actions .","covid - 19 is characterized by a long incubation period , strong infectivity and difficulty of detection , which has led to the sudden outbreak and the rapid development of an epidemic ."
"the production of epidemic maps was quickly completed through multi - scale dynamic template technology , which allowed timely dissemination of epidemic dynamic information .","from the perspective of spatial simulation and analysis , this study simulated the spatial transmission process of the epidemic scientifically by increasing detailed regional variables and changing the population flow and r ( basic reproduction number ) according to the prevention and control measures ."
"for example , the status of big data source restrictions in commercial enterprises may restrict the data supply needed for social management , result in the lack of a mature scheme for big data aggregation , and cause difficulty of rapid online application of deep integration , which are ongoing issues .","in assessing the contribution of gis and spatial big data technology to the containment of the covid - 19 epidemic , it is clear that many challenges remain to be studied ."
"animal consumption - based food systems , ranging from the harvest of free - ranging wild species ( hereafter , wild harvest systems ) to the in situ stocking of domestic or farmed wild animals ( hereafter , animal production systems ) , have been implicated in the emergence of many of these viruses , including hiv , ebola , sars , and highly pathogenic avian infl uenza ( hpai ) .",zoonotic viruses of wildlife origin have caused the majority of recent emerging infectious diseases ( eids ) that have had signifi cant impacts on human health or economies .
"food forms the foundation of human societies , promoting health and wellbeing , and sustaining growing populations ( tilman et al .","at the same time , wild harvest and animal production systems form a fundamental component of food systems more broadly ( milner - gulland and bennett ; faostat ) ."
"here we review the current status of eids , and in particular viral zoonoses originating in wildlife , as they relate to wild harvest and animal production systems .",we conclude that both systems present considerable proximal and distal risks for disease emergence through a number of mechanisms .
"first , "" animal production systems "" are typifi ed by in situ stocking and raising of animals ( both domestic and in some cases wild species ) at small to very large scales and from low to very high densities .","secondly , "" wild harvest systems "" typically involve direct harvest of wild , free - roaming animal species ( including , for example , "" bushmeat "" ) ."
"japanese encephalitis represents an example where humans are infected when bitten by mosquito vectors , which acquire and maintain infection after feeding on wild hosts or infected domestic species ( e . g . , pigs ) .","for diseases more diffusely associated with agricultural activities , infection often occurs via contact with virus present in wildlife excreta ( e . g . , hantaviruses ) or fomites ( see table . 1 and references therein ) ."
the development of roads may represent one of the most signifi cant ways of increasing opportunities for wild harvest .,"roads are considered critical infrastructure developments that can improve access to technologies , healthcare and educa - tion , forming a key component of many countries ' development plans ."
"climate change is eected to infl uence migration patterns of migratory bird species that are the natural reservoirs for many ai viruses , alter transmission dynamics and affect the survival of virus outside of hosts , all of which have the potential to shift disease risks for this important group of viruses ( gilbert et al .","for example , climate change may infl uence some key elements of the avian infl uenza a transmission cycle ."
"in addition to the risk of wildlife origin zoonoses making their way into humans via a domestic animal intermediary , the widespread use of antimicrobials in food production , primarily for non - therapeutic growth promotion in livestock and aquaculture production , may introduce rapid selection pressure for resistant bacterial and viral strains and further contribute to disease risks .","the increasing intensifi cation of food production , marked by high animal densities and stressful conditions , may facilitate rapid spread of diseases among immunocompromised and genetically similar animals , potentially compromising food security and posing zoonotic disease risks ."
"additionally , as intensifi cation occurs , biosecurity measures become all the more necessary .","for example , a lag in biosecurity practices during increases in poultry production has been attributed to the evolution of hpai h5n1 in poultry fl ocks , which caused extensive impacts to the poultry and public health sectors , leading to mortality or culling of over million birds , as well as several hundred human deaths ( karesh et al ."
managing these underlying drivers may ultimately provide solutions for sustainability and public health threats .,"we propose that direct mitigation of disease transmission is thus only ever going to be a part of what urgently needs to be a much more encompassing , proactive strategy targeting the distal risks of disease emergence ) ."
"the un ' s post - 2015 sustainable development goals set the stage for poverty reduction , food access / security , health , and environmental balance , potentially providing opportunities for integrated solutions that could be applied to food safety challenges related to wildlife and food systems .","this need is especially urgent in the food safety realm , where nutritional dependencies demand sustainable access to food sources ."
"in addition , emerging viruses are not only threats to humans , but may also be pathogenic to susceptible wild host species .",there is thus a compelling opportunity for co - benefi ts for conservation and public health through collaborative efforts .
"as a result , efforts have largely focused on reactive responses to disease emergence events , rather than prevention of disease risks .","the world organization for animal health ( oie ) regulates trade of livestock for priority diseases , which include some potential zoonoses ( e . g . , hpai ) , but does not address wildlife trade / pathogens specifi cally in its world trade organizationenforced sanitary standards ."
"employing risk analysis tools can assist in science - based policies by anticipating and identifying ways to mitigate risk , as well as identifying priority knowledge gaps for research investments to refi ne future analyses .","the structure of a formal risk analysis can help provide continuity and objectivity in the process , involving problem description , hazard identifi cation , risk assessment , risk management , implementation and review , and risk communication throughout ."
while uncertainty and complexity inherently exist in wildlife disease risk analysis ( jakob - hoff et al .,") , useful information can be gained , especially for viral disease threats where initial knowledge on transmission pathways and pathogen dynamics can enable best practices to reduce risks while more information is gathered ."
"harvesting of wild meat holds a critical position in the diets , economies , and cultures of millions of people globally .","current governance and enforcement structures are therefore unlikely to be fully effective and in many cases unwarranted for reducing local demand ( e . g . , for local populations living in or on the periphery of forests with few suitable alternatives ) ."
"this type of analysis could be included within existing health impact assessment ( hia ) structures , because , while some hias include risk of zoonotic diseases from domestic animals and other vectors , few adequately address the range of potential zoonotic pathogens in their intended scope .",governments could require wildlife disease risk analysis processes to be undertaken for proposed development projects to more proactively weigh risks and ensure risk prevention or mitigation measures are conducted .
"in this scenario , specifi c known zoonoses are tested for , treated or infected animals removed from a farm ' s founder wild - caught stock , resulting in reduced risk of zoonotic pathogen "" spillover "" to ranchers , traders , or butchers .",we propose that the farming of wildlife species could reduce the risk of zoonotic disease spillover if similar health and biosecurity measures are applied to farmed wildlife as to livestock .
"for example , regions with tsetse fl y infestations affect cattle production through high morbidity and mortality burden from trypanosomiasis ; while wildlife appear to carry infection , they are not highly susceptible to it ( steverding ) .","in theory , wildlife ranching may provide a contained environment where disease may be controlled through adoption of effective biosecurity measures ."
"ranch - raised wild animals may also potentially come into greater contact with wildlife ( e . g . , if ranches are at the periphery of protected areas ) , potentially shifting the dynamics of population genetics and pathogen fl ow .","since the main risk pathways from viral zoonoses originating in wildlife associated with animal production systems come from the spillover of wildlife pathogens to domestically farmed species , more research is needed on disease risks in wildlife farms versus in freeranging wildlife , as well as the development of formal guidelines on biosecurity and other practices to reduce risks to and from native wildlife , such as guidelines on proximity to conserved areas ."
"firstly , we lack knowledge of most of the viral pathogens that are circulating in wildlife ( most of which have not yet been discovered and characterized ( anthony et al .",") ) , and how those pathogens are evolving in relation to our changing pressures on the environment ."
"while current systems are inadequate for prevention and early detection , existing programs may be leveraged as a starting point .","current surveillance systems for viral zoonoses are highly reactive , largely capturing threats once they have emerged in humans or have caused extensive livestock or wildlife morbidity or mortality ."
the currently siloed mandates of intergovernmental organizations and government departments limit the actionable utility of data .,"to suffi ciently respond to viral disease threats that are identifi ed by surveillance , a coordinated , multi - disciplinary system is needed ."
"the un ' s convention on biological diversity recently "" recognized the value of a one health approach "" toward shared health and biodiversity benefi ts at its th conference of the parties in october , and also has addressed sustainable use of biodiversity in terms of bushmeat and sustainable wildlife management , providing a possible entry for work on both topics by cbd member countries .","partners from the biodiversity community also have a strong role for participation , through conservation efforts that are increasingly recognizing the risks of infectious disease agents to wildlife populations ( e . g . , great ape die - offs from infection with ebola ) ."
a phase change in the broadening of health toward an ecosystem perspective is needed to truly maximize cross - disciplinary synergies .,"on a national level , including through integration into cbd members ' national biodiversity strategies and action plans , laboratories can be modifi ed or constructed to serve human and animal health screening needs , avoiding potential duplication of resources , and enabling closer collaboration among human and animal health authorities and researchers ."
"surveillance can be targeted to assess risks at food - associated interfaces , such as wildlife hunting , markets where bushmeat is present , and restaurants serving wildlife .","the protocols could be implemented more widely , including in national surveillance systems ."
"many noncurable maladies , like neurodegenerative diseases and cancers have effectively been cured using this technology .",rapid advances are still in progress for the development of rnai - based technologies that will be having a major impact on medical research .
the discovery of gene silencing through rnai in mammalian systems has facilitated the use of rnai as a therapeutic agent for curing various ailments of mammalian systems .,various efforts are in pipeline to create rnai - based therapies and leverage the vast potential of this technology to treat patients .
various commercial entities are available nowadays to make use of the algorithms present online and provide the researchers with effective designs of sirnas instantly .,"a combination of mrna target sequences , secondary structures , sirna duplex end stabilities have been designed for effective treatment of diseases ."
silencing for a particular gene remains effective up to few days after the administration of sirnas in cell culture systems because successive cell divisions and degrading action of cellular nucleases dilutes the sirna counts with time .,"as rna - dependent rna polymerases are absent in the mammalian cells , gene silencing induced by synthetically delivered sirnas have been restricted to the number of rna molecules introduced into a cell ."
success rate was % reduction of apo b level in liver and % reduction in jejunum with lowering of overall cholesterol levels .,one of the promising outcomes of gene silencing response was observed in nonhuman primates by transfecting sirnas conjugated with stable nucleic acid - lipid particles ( snalps ) .
"other than these vectors created , adenoviruses and adenovirus - associated viruses ( aav ) are capable of infecting wide range of cell types in vivo .","recently , lentiviral vectors have been used to deliver shrna eression cassette in hematopoietic stem cells of hiv - infected patients ex vivo , and then these transfused cells were again reinfused in them for therapeutic healing in vivo ."
rnai is an efficient therapeutic tool for ocular disease treatment and the clinical trials were primarily carried out in mouse model for substantial output .,"the most successful demonstration was reported in the als model , where it was reported to double the latency period and prolong the life span up to % approximately after intramuscular injections of shrnas ."
"it is having three etiologies : genetic ( leading to mutations in the gene encoding the prion protein [ prp ] ) , acquired ( due to egenous prion infection ) , and sporadic ( of unknown causes ) .",prion is a fatal transmissible neurodegenerative disease for which no pharmacological treatment is available .
"in viral infections , rnai specifically targets cellular genes as it eliminates the major problem of genetic variability that occurs in most of the viruses .","in hiv infections , coreceptor cc chemokine receptor ( ccr5 ) has resulted into setting efficient and promising target for rna - induced viral therapy ."
the sir - na - based clinical trials using rsv as delivery agent are gaining fast access because of the effectiveness of the approach .,"in addition to these rnai - based therapeutics has also been developed for ebola virus , herpes simplex virus - 2 , and sars coronavirus ."
"moreover , the rnai mechanism was validated when an mrna fragment was detected at a predicted site in a patient who was injected with the highest dose of the nanoparticles and conferred that systemically administered sirna is capable of specific gene inhibition through rnai .",comparative analysis with pre - dosing tissue showed reduction in levels of both the specific messenger rna ( m2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase ( rrm2 ) and the protein ( rrm2 ) .
ribonucleic acid responsible for coding all protein compliment of the cell can be the ideal target for disease treatment and drug discovery .,"being an important mediator of gene eression , the most efficient way to silence eression of defective gene is at rna level ."
"therefore , the scenario of rnai as a therapeutic tool is eanding day by day for curing certain incurable and fatal diseases .","a particular defective gene can be selectively inhibited especially in cases where the disease is often caused by a dominant mutation in a single allele like age - related macular degeneration ( amd ) , diabetic retinopathy , respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) ."
potential reduction in otes can be achieved through - o - methyl modification in the seed region of sirna .,genome - wide libraries were used for designing rnai reagents that can improve knockdown efficiency simultaneously minimizing otes .
use of multiple conserved sequences from viral genome enhances the chances of escaping mutants .,the consistent problem of viral evolution was also resolved by using cornai phenomenon .
binding to non - specific targets may elicit unpredicted and unwanted side effects and is a matter of significant concern .,the endogenous splicing machinery of the target cell can be blocked or harmed due to competitive binding of sirna sequences with endogenous mirna pathway components .
"low efficiency of gene transfer , limitations on transgene size , specifically an inability to deliver genomic size loci , insertional mutagenesis , integration - associated events , immune responses , and toxicity also limit the conventional gene therapy .",rnai recently emerged as a powerful alternative to conventional gene replacement therapies for correcting genetic defects and is mainly concerned with correcting autosomal dominant diseases .
"since a decade ago , rnai has emerged as a promising and powerful eerimental tool for novel therapeutics .","rnai has widely elored attention for dominant targets involved in ocular , neurodegenerative , and hd therapeutics ."
"antibodies , including neutralizing antibodies , were detectable in ( 86% ) of persons for at least months after the outbreak .","to determine how long antibodies against middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus persist , we measured long - term antibody responses among persons serologically positive or indeterminate after a outbreak in jordan ."
"new cases and clusters of mers - cov infections continue to occur within the arabian peninsula , and the virus has been erted to other countries around the world .","the first known cases of mers - cov occurred during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory infections in zarqa , jordan , during march - april ."
"in may , we obtained serologic and epidemiologic data from persons : the outbreak survivors , their eed contacts , and their household members .","for persons affected by the april outbreak , the cause of death remained unknown until late , when retained samples produced positive mers - cov results according to reverse transcription pcr ."
duration of antibody responses beyond months has not been reported .,our objective was to evaluate long - term antibody responses among persons with laboratory - confirmed to mers - cov infection .
"all surviving members of the outbreak in jordan , their eed contacts , and their household members who were identified serologically as either mers - cov positive or indeterminate were asked to consent to further participation .",participants were asked to provide a follow - up serologic specimen so we could compare - month results with - month results .
the presence of neutralizing antibody titers was determined by microneutralization with live mers - cov ( hu / jordan - n3 / 2012 strain ) in a biosafety level laboratory as described previously .,antibody titers in serum samples were determined by an anti - mers - cov nucleocapsid indirect elisa and by mers - cov ( hu / jordan - n3 / 2012 strain ) indirect ifa .
"of the surviving persons with > 1 positive serologic test result , ( 87% ) consented to follow - up testing .",all ( 100% ) surviving persons with > 2 positive serologic test results months after the mers - cov outbreak also consented .
"for the probable case - patients , elisa titers at months ranged from < 400 to , 600 , representing reduced antibody titers compared with the - month estimates persistence of antibodies against mers - cov ( 400 - 6,400 ) for all but person ( table ) .","a nurse who worked in an intensive care unit ( participant ) and cared for confirmed case - patients during the outbreak was the only participant for whom elisa indicated a consistent titer of , 600 at both times ."
each of these persons had negative serologic test results at months and continue to be considered negative overall .,"notwithstanding improvements in public health awareness and infection control practices in affected countries on the arabian peninsula and in the middle east , emergence of the virus ( e . g . , its introduction to south korea and the resultant epidemic of ) is ongoing ."
"nonetheless , of the persons for whom chest radiographs showed substantial changes within days of symptom onset , each remained positive by microneutralization ( > 20 ) months after the outbreak .",any association between our mers - cov antibody results and clinical severity is therefore difficult to assess .
our finding of generally reduced but persistent mers - cov antibody responses even at months suggests the potential for longer lasting antibody - mediated protective immunity against reinfection .,"however , whether such long - lasting antibodies can prevent reinfection or affect clinical outcome has yet to be examined ."
"although limited outbreaks of mers - cov have occurred in jordan since , contact tracing efforts by investigators in jordan lead us to believe that these persons were not subsequently eed .",the times at which mers - cov antibodies were measured in our study were chosen because of logistics and field practicalities .
"additionally , he has led several mers investigations and worked to establish post - hajj acute respiratory illness surveillance in the middle east .","dr . payne is the principal investigator and project officer for the centers for disease control and prevention study enhanced active surveillance of pediatric infectious diseases and vaccines , and he conducts phase iv vaccine effectiveness evaluations ."
"quadruplexes formed in the utr of the mrna inhibit cap - dependent translation ( e . g . , nras and bcl - 2 ) and enhance ires - mediated cap - independent translation ( e . g . , hveg - f and fgf2 ) .","besides , g4s also influence other molecular mechanisms in rna biology such as splicing , ribosomal frameshifting , mrna localization , repeat - associated non - aug ( ran ) translation , and maturation of mirnas ( reviewed in ) ."
"several reports convincingly demonstrate antimicrobial activity of quadruplex - binding ligands against clinically challenging pathogens , including hiv - 1 , hcv , ebola virus , plasmodium falciparum , and mycobacterium tuberculosis .",quadruplexes are increasingly being recognized as novel therapeutic targets in microbes .
"helicases , including fancj , pif1 , dhx36 , blm , and wrn , can unwind the g4s in eukaryotic genomes .",persistence of g4 structures can dysregulate the cellular activities they control and also compromise genomic integrity .

"adp - ribosylation of proteins regulates protein activities in various processes including transcription control , chromatin organization , organelle assembly , protein degradation , and dna repair .",modulating the proteins involved in the metabolism of adp - ribosylation can have therapeutic benefits in various disease states .
the sirtuins : sirtuins are most prominent as nad + - dependent deacetylases of protein acetyl - lysines .,"finally , we describe the structures of poly ( adp - ribose ) glycohydrolases ( pargs ) which degrade poly ( adp - ribose ) ( par ) chains and of adp - ribose hydrolases ( arh ) which remove mono - 1.1 . 3 ."
par binding is mediated by all four modules and motifs ; the remaining two functions are indicated for certain macro domain proteins .,"these fulfill three physiological functions , namely ( i ) par binding and localization of proteins to sites of parp activity ; ( ii ) binding of mono - adp - ribosylated substrate proteins ; and ( iii ) sequestration and turnover of adp - ribose metabolites ."
"the module appears to be utilized to recognize poly ( adp - ribose ) and several adp - ribose metabolites in the processes of dna repair , gene regulation , signaling events , and control of nad metabolism ) .","( gorbalenya et al . , ) and subsequently found in histone macro h2a protein ( pehrson and fried ) , the ~ 120 residue macro domains have now been identified in the genomes from species across all kingdoms of life ."
"this is exemplified by af1521 and histone macro h2a1 , both of which bind par chains ( karras et al . , ) , fig .","by contrast , the proximal n - ribose ( nicotinamide ribose , or ribose "" ) is situated in the continuous crevice that is lined by overall positive charge , suggestive of par phosphate group accommodation ."
"nevertheless , it is clear that the surface loops surrounding the n - ribose are variable , and may have evolved for enzymatic activities .","this is also highlighted by the case of parg : these glycohydrolases that break down par chains have a macro domain core , but also contain acidic sidechains in the adp - ribose binding site , which activate the nribose for nucleophilic attack ( elaborated in section . below ) ."
"in addition , a crystal structure of human e3 ubiquitin protein ligase chfr ( checkpoint with forkhead and ring finger domains ) ( oberoi et al . , ) includes a c - terminal pbz domain .","the small domain folds into two short parallel - strands and a small - helix with a loop connecting the first strand and the helix , fig ."

removal of adp - ribose from mono ( adp - ribos ) ylated proteins ( or the terminal adp - ribose moiety after par chain breakdown ) is assisted by at least one of several arh isoforms in vertebrates .,the arh class of enzymes is closely related to the drag bacterial enzymes with adp - ribose glycohydrolase activity .
"b , c , which contributes strongly to parg catalytic efficiency and inhibitor binding ( koh et al . , ; kim et al . , ; pdb : a0d ) .","the rat and human parg catalytic regions ( core and the nterminal accessory domains ) are very similar ; they adopt a bean - shaped structure with a deep central cleft containing the conserved parg signature motif and a "" tyrosine clasp "" , fig ."
"in arh3 , the active site is situated in the top center of the molecule , with major sidechain contributions from two of the subdomains .","e , show globular , purely - helical protein folds composed of helical bundle subdomains ."
"if so , a next question will be whether arh1 catalyzes the removal of adp - ribose from a variety of substrates and sidechains , or whether there are other , as yet unidentified adp - ribose glycohydrolases .","since arh3 is mitochondrial ( mueller - dieckmann et al . , ; niere et al . , ) , it will be interesting to see whether it can remove also the last remaining adp - ribose moiety of its modified substrate ."
"the reverse reaction , removal of adp - ribose and reactivation of the enzyme , is catalyzed by dinitrogenase reductase activating glycohydrolase ( drag ) .",adp - ribosylation of an arginine residue by dinitrogenase reductase adp - ribosyl transferase ( drat ) inactivates the enzyme .

"however , a biochemical study of parp1 binding to various dna structures indicated a dimer interaction with certain dna ( pion et al . , ) , and a dimer structure has been inferred from the crystal structure of zn1 - zn2 bound to a dna double strand break ( ali et al . , ) .","several structural studies indicate that parp1 binds to dna as a monomer , including an nmr study of zn1 - zn2 interaction with dna , crystal structures of individual zn1 and zn2 domains bound to dna , a sa analysis of a zn1 - zn2 - zn3 - brct complex with dna ( lilyestrom et al . , ) , and a sedimentation analysis of full - length parp1 in the presence of dna ( langelier et al . , ) ."
"the decrease in thermal stability is also observed in full - length parp1 upon binding to a dna break , and this destabilizing effect requires the cat domain and residues located at parp1 interdomain interfaces ( langelier et al . , ) .","together with the crystal structure , these biochemical results suggest that the assembly of parp1 regulatory domains on dna ends establishes a network of interdomain contacts that lead to a disruption of the hd hydrophobic core , and subsequently to a decrease in thermal stability ."
"positioning of the zn2 and brct domains on the parp1 / dna crystal structure suggests a model of fulllength parp1 , fig .","upon binding to dna breaks , the regulatory domains of parp1 collapse onto each other to form a more compact structure ( langelier et al . , ) ."
"thus , it will also be interesting to see how the hd of parp2 and parp3 will be regulated , and whether they ultimately use destabilization of the hd as a mechanism of activation .","parp2 / artd2 and parp3 / artd3 catalytic domains also contain an hd , but there overall domain organization is quite different from parp1 ."

the activation of innate and adaptive immune signaling pathways and effector functions often occur at cellular membranes and are regulated by complex mechanisms .,here we review the growing number of proteins known to be regulated by s - palmitoylation in immune cells emerging from recent advances in chemical proteomics .
this covalent attachment of the - carbon palmitic acid to specific cysteine side chains regulates protein trafficking to membrane compartments in numerous biological processes .,s - palmitoylation is a reversible lipid post - translational modification that occurs on proteins in diverse cell types including lymphocytes that are crucial for the innate and adaptive immune responses .
demonstrating the incorporation of radiolabeled palmitate into candidate proteins at specific cysteine residues remained a gold standard for defining s - palmitoylation for more than two decades .,"however , this notoriously cumbersome and insensitive radioactivity - based method has limited the study of s - palmitoylation ."
"in addition , bioorthogonal ligation of alk - 16 / odya labeled proteins with affinity tags such as azide - functionalized biotin enables enrichment and identification of spalmitoylated proteins by mass spectrometry - based proteomics .","compared to days or weeks for autoradiography , improved fluorescent detection of s - palmitoylated proteins using alk - 16 / odya takes minutes ."
"in this context , analysis of key proteins in t cell signaling has revealed an important role for s - palmitoylation in immunity .",engagement of the t cell receptor ( tcr ) by peptide / major histocompatibility complexes ( mhc ) on antigen presenting cells induces the activation and proliferation of t cells .
"in addition , kinetics of palmitate turnover on lck , which is accelerated upon t cell activation , is consistent with its cytosol - membrane exchange kinetics ( ~ 50 s ) .","although artificial targeting of chimeric lck and lat constructs to the plasma membrane without raft association restored their function in tcr signaling , their signaling properties are altered ."
"the integration of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in t cell cultures with pulse - chase alk - 16 / odya proteomic studies has revealed distinct subsets of signaling proteins that are dynamically s - palmitoylated , suggesting that not all fatty - acylated proteins are subjected to temporal regulation like the ras gtpases .","the latter included histone h3 variants , which were found to be s - palmitoylated on cysteine suggesting a novel potential role for this modification in histone h3 function ."
"furthermore , s - palmitoylation has been reported for several cell surface receptors responsible for antigen uptake or dendritic cell activation during virus infections such as cd36 and the interferon / receptor , respectively .","even so , some mhc molecules themselves and other antigen presentation - associated proteins , such as the mhc - associated invariant chain and tetraspanins , have been shown to be s - palmitoylated , lending credence to the hypothesis that s - palmitoylation is important at both sides of this cell - to - cell signaling interface ."
"a majority of the identified proteins were previously reported in other cell types , and included calnexin , transferrin receptor , mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor , n - ras , g protein subunits , and the tetraspanin cd9 .","additionally , several novel candidate s - palmitoylated proteins involved in immune responses were identified ."
phospholipid scramblase ( plscr3 ) was also identified in this study and its sites of s - palmitoylation were mapped to a cluster of five cysteines .,"an s - palmitoylationdeficient plscr3 mutant was mislocalized from the mitochondria to the nucleus , providing the first example of protein targeting to the mitochondria by s - palmitoylation ."
"these proteins included tetraspanins c 1 , cd9 , cd63 , and c 2 , as well as ifitm1 , n - ras , and lck .","of the newly identified molecules , the immunoregulatory , b cell - specific cd20 molecule and cd23 , which is important for b cell development , were validated by demonstrating alk - 16 / odya incorporation on specific cysteine residues ."
"of the novel spalmitoylated proteins that have been identified , only a limited number have been functionally characterized .","in t cells the lymphocyte specific cd5 protein and the tcr delta chain ( cd3 ) , whose deficiency leads to severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome , were identified from s - palmitoyl - proteomics but not further characterized ."
the abe method requires capping of free cysteines with thiol - reactive reagents such as n - ethylmaleimide ( nem ) followed by removal of spalmitoylation with nh oh .,eed cysteines on previously palmitoylated proteins are then reacted with a thiol - reactive biotin analogue .
"next generation vaccines also include dna vaccines which transfect cells in order to eress the antigen of interest , and are delivered either in a plasmid form or vectored using an intact bacteria or virus .","next generation vaccines include virus - like particles ( vlps ) that are noninfectious but are immunogenic , or can act as carriers to linked peptide - antigens ."
"local reactions are often observed with vaccines administered via the intramuscular or subcutaneous routes of administration , and there are concerns about the severity of pain , redness , swelling , in addition to formation of granulomas and abcesses at the injection site , necrosis and regional lymphadenopathy .","vaccines might induce systemic reactions , including nausea , diarrhea and general malaise ."
"this chapter will focus on the nonclinical safety assessment of vaccines , and will include a discussion of the toxicology studies that need to be performed for new vaccines in clinical development and quality control tests that are needed to demonstrate that the vaccine product is safe for use in humans .","this includes in vitro and in vivo studies to examine the mechanism of action and potential ef fi cacy of the vaccine , in addition to a thorough evaluation of the safety of the vaccine ."
"over time , the extent of nonclinical safety testing has been greatly increased and a requirement for full toxicology studies of vaccine candidates have been implemented according to current guidelines ( table . 1 ) .","presently , nonclinical safety studies with vaccine candidates , including the next generation vaccines , are aligned with overall principles of j . j . wolf et al ."
"it should be noted that there are some limitations of safety evaluation in animals , since effects in animals are not always indicative of the effect that might be seen in humans , and rare toxicities that appear in certain subpopulations are only detected in clinical studies .",toxicology studies provide information that might help to determine a safe starting dose in the clinical study and identify any potential toxicities or target organs .
"the vaccine lots used in glp studies should be from lots that are manufactured with a similar production process , formulation , and release speci fi cations as the lots intended for clinical use .",toxicology studies are usually conducted in compliance with good laboratory practices ( glp ) .
"this "" overdosing "" approach based on the number of doses administered , i . e . , one more dose is administered in animals when compared with the number of doses administered to humans , and greater dosing frequency , i . e . , every - 3 weeks in animals compared to typically every few months in humans , is driven by the intent to maximize potential hazard identi fi cation in nonclinical safety studies .","in addition , the full - human dose of the vaccine or the maximum amount that can be injected into the selected animal species also results in much higher eure to the vaccine in animals based on their smaller body weight compared to humans ."
"treatment - related effects that are typically observed in repeat - dose studies with vaccines administered parenterally , include in fl ammation at the injection site , hyperplasia of the draining lymph nodes , increases in spleen weight and clinical chemistry changes that are indicative of an in fl ammatory response .","these are typically not severe and are transient changes , and they are therefore not considered to be an adverse effect ."
"therefore , caution is needed when evaluating the bene fi t - to - risk ratio for both therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines .",it should be noted that certain target populations for therapeutic vaccines might be immunosuppressed due to other concomitant medications .
adjuvants can be used to modify a desired immune response and activate both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system .,"novel adjuvants are being incorporated in next generation vaccine formulations in order to reduce the amount of vaccine antigen and increase both the magnitude and duration of the immune response , thereby reducing the frequency of booster immunizations needed ."
"if the adjuvant is not species - speci fi c , it is tested in two species ( one rodent and one non - rodent ) .","if the adjuvant is species - speci fi c , then testing in one species might be justi fi ed ."
"with this approach , nonclinical safety studies with an adjuvant alone would be included in the master file and potentially repetitive safety studies of that adjuvant alone could be omitted .","perhaps , a practical approach to compliance with these eectations by developers of vaccines containing novel adjuvants could include a generation of a "" master file "" for a given adjuvant ."
different delivery systems are being used to incorporate immunopotentiators and focus the immune response through a desired path .,several types of delivery devices for vaccines are also being evaluated in order to more ef fi ciently target the vaccine to a speci fi c area in the body and reduce the pain associated with needle - based injections .
"biocompatibility studies utilize analytical chemistry , in vitro tests , and animal models .",the manufacturer of the device usually performs biocompatibility testing to evaluate the interaction between the device and tissues .
toxicity studies examining the speci fi c method of electroporation are needed .,"for dna - based vaccines , electroporation has been used to deliver the dna into cells ."
a study of the excipient within the repeat - dose toxicity studies for the vaccine is more relevant with respect to the interaction of the excipient with other vaccine formulation components .,"residuals and contaminants are substances that are used in the manufacturing process and may be present in the fi nal formulation in residual amounts ( e . g . , formaldehyde , toxins , viral growth media ) ."
"in developing the ttc concept , an eert group under the international life sciences institute ( ilsi ) considered a wide range of toxicological concerns including metabolism and accumulation , structural alerts , strategies for the nonclinical safety assessment of vaccines endocrine disrupting chemicals , genetic toxicity , carcinogenicity , neurotoxicity , teratogenicity , developmental toxicity , allergenicity , and immunotoxicity .",the goal of the establishment and application of acceptable ttc values was to avoid unnecessary toxicity testing and safety evaluations when human intake was below a threshold amount that would be safe even for harmful chemicals .
"at the same time , toxicology studies are eected to be conducted in a laboratory animal species , for which historical control data exist to help distinguish true toxicity caused by the tested vaccine from potential background ( not test article - treatment related ) lesions occasionally found during a thorough histopathological examination of most organs and tissues involved in such studies .","animal species that are used in nonclinical safety studies with vaccine candidates should be able to mount an immune response , for example , antibody levels to the vaccine antigens ."
"instead , mice , rabbits and / or nonhuman primates ( nhps ) are typical species in vaccine pharmacology studies based on available models of diseases and attempts to predict immune responses from animals to humans .","in order to "" bridge "" the toxicology and pharmacology animal species , a measurement of immune responses in species selected for nonclinical safety evaluation ( e . g . , rats ) to a vaccine candidate is included in a separate study or within a repeat - dose toxicity study ."
"such effects may include changes in hematology ( various white blood cell types ) and serum biochemistry ( e . g . , protein and globulin ) parameters , local irritation and in fl ammation at the injection site , lymphoid enlargement and hyperplasia , and spleen weight increases .","these effects are generally modest and reversible , and , as consequences of the intended pharmacological activity of the vaccine , are usually not considered adverse ."
"therefore , the potential for a systemic in fl ammatory response for vaccines , particularly those containing strategies for the nonclinical safety assessment of vaccines immuno - active adjuvants , is eected to be assessed within the nonclinical toxicology studies .","while there are several examples of animal safety studies conducted with a novel adjuvant alone or included as a control group for the toxicology study with a vaccine containing that adjuvant , including oligonucleotides ( e . g . , cpg dna sequences ) , oil emulsions ( e . g . , mf59 ) , and saponinbased ( e . g . , qs - 21 ) adjuvants , they generally con fi rmed the eected dosedependent effects based on mechanisms of action , but did not reveal any fi ndings of toxicological concerns ."
the results are not necessarily conclusive at this stage but help to direct future work on biomarkers in both animal and clinical studies .,"in these studies , measurements of anti - cardiolipin antibodies , anti - b2 glycoprotein and ige levels were evaluated ."
metagene - and pathway - based analytical approaches were adopted to provide quantitative readouts with biological relevance which can be used to study mode of action and rank vaccine and adjuvant candidates under development .,gene pro fi ling was performed on peripheral blood from monkeys treated with several vaccines with known clinical adverse effects .
"while work focused on establishing reliable biomarkers to apply them to nonclinical and clinical safety evaluation is ongoing , some steps to address concerns about undesired immune stimulation in toxicology studies can be put in place by including additional parameters that are not routinely measured in these studies .","for example , potential prolonged systemic in fl ammatory responses can be assessed by measuring acute phase proteins , e . g ."
"however , the regulatory authorities do not presume a product is safe until it has been directly tested using appropriate preclinical test methods and well - designed , adequately powered clinical trials .","therefore , to address potential developmental hazards of vaccine candidates , developmental toxicity studies in animal models are currently required for vaccines indicated for maternal immunization and / or immunization of women of childbearing age , according to the fda ' s guideline titled "" considerations for reproductive toxicity studies for preventive vaccines for infectious disease indications "" ."
"since the primary concern for preventive and therapeutic vaccines is safety during development and growth of the embryo and fetus , the evaluation is focused on effects on the pregnant / lactating female and embryo - fetal development following eure of the female to the vaccine from implantation through the end of pregnancy , with follow - up of the offspring through weaning .","a postnatal follow - up of the pups from birth to weaning is also included to assess normal growth , nursing activity , body weights , and viability which are established as reliable indicators of normal development ."
these questions were discussed at a workshop on nonclinical evaluation of vaccines .,it was reported that participants generally agreed that the primary objectives and design of current dart studies performed according to the existing guidelines are appropriate and no speci fi c changes were recommended .
"the testing may also be used as a screening tool for biological materials that may have inherent characteristics that may affect their safety and / or tolerability ( e . g . , pyrogenicity testing on a vaccine candidate with bacterial components ) .","the main goal of this type of testing is to identify issues that may have arisen during manufacturing ( i . e . , introduction of adventitious agents / contaminants , changes in potency and / or properties of cell substrates or other biological starting materials over time ) ."
"for example , the speci fi cations for the general safety test listed in the cfr differ from those in the ep .",testing requirements vary by region so manufacturers who market biologics worldwide typically design the assays such that the criteria for all markets may be satis fi ed in a single assay .
"eggs are also utilized via various injection routes for the detection of herpesviruses , poxviruses , rhabdoviruses , rickettsiae , mycoplasmas , bacteria , orthomyviruses ( in fl uenza virus ) , and paramyviruses ( mumps , measles , parain fl uenza viruses ) , alphaviruses , and vesiculoviruses .","guinea pigs are sensitive to mycobacterium tuberculosis and adventitious viruses including paramyviruses ( including sendai virus ) , reoviruses , and fi loviruses , and rabbits are used to screen for simian herpes b virus ."
alternatives for some of the in vivo tests have been developed .,"for example , in vitro alternatives to the rabbit pyrogen test include the limulus amebocyte lysate ( lal ) and the monocyte activation test ( mat ) ."
"it should be noted , however , that in vitro tests may not always correlate with clinical eerience due to their ability to detect chemical changes that may not lead to functional effects on potency .","the design of potency studies is fl exible and generally product - speci fi c and if an in vivo model is available , one may start with an animal ( typically mouse ) test with plans to move to an in vitro model proven to correlate with in vivo data in an effort to reduce animal use ."
"in some cases , neurovirulence testing is required , for example , if inadequate data on neurovirulence of a virus for which a novel vaccine is being developed , if neurotropism or neurovirulence is apparent , or if a novel vaccine has been attenuated by passage in neuronal tissue .","however , novel models for neurovirulence testing that do not involve the use of nhps are being pursued ."
"the cell culture safety test in human diploid or monkey kidney cells detects a variety of adventitious viruses that include cytopathic viruses , hemadsorption viruses , and hemagglutinating viruses .","the use of human diploid cells identi fi es a variety of human viruses ( such as herpesviruses , adenoviruses , coronaviruses , reoviruses , alphaviruses , rubella , fl aviviruses , rabies , enteroviruses , certain strains of hepatitis a virus , poliovirus , coackie b virus , echovirus , rhinoviruses , orthomyviruses , paramyviruses ) and simian viruses ( such as simian cytomegalovirus ) ."
"other tests for detection of adventitious viruses include : transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) which can detect viral particles in a cell substrate , including those from endogenous retroviruses ; reverse transcriptase ( rt ) assays which can detect any retrovirus , as all retroviruses encode and contain rt ; infectivity tests for retroviruses which can be performed on a case - by - case basis ; and pcr or southern blot which can be performed to detect speci fi c viruses .","in vitro tests for nonviral adventitious agents include tests for mycoplasma , mycobacteria , and bacterial and fungal sterility ."
residual cellular or nuclear material in the fi nal product poses a potential risk because of oncogenic and / or infectivity potential .,"dna can be removed , digested , or inactivated to lessen these risks ."
"with the continuous progress in technology , especially molecular and genetic methodologies applied both in discovery of vaccines and formulation sciences , the development of well - de fi ned speci fi c antigens for use in vaccines enables production of next generation novel vaccines to prevent and / or treat diseases which have been refractory to vaccination in the past .",the development of a broad range of novel or next generation vaccines containing more synthetic and / or recombinant components rather than microorganism - derived components has a clear advantage from the manufacturing and process control perspective .
the principles for the nonclinical safety assessment reviewed in this chapter should provide a foundation for the evaluation of next generation vaccines .,"nevertheless , many recent scienti fi c and regulatory discussions dedicated to this topic seem to indicate that currently recommended and applied approaches to nonclinical development , including toxicology studies , of vaccine candidates are appropriate and adequate ."
virus infections may be seen especially in immunocompromised people and can be life - changing or even lethal .,"some viruses , such as herpes simplex viruses , can also cause obvious oral lesions ."
"host innate or acquired immunity , and saliva can be protective against many infections which may be increased in people it may be difficult or impossible to differentiate saliva transmission from that by body fluids or fomites introduced into the mouth , respiratory droplets , aerosols , or other routes .",humans can be reservoirs of viruses ; asymptomatic shedding before clinical disease or where the infection is subclinical ( undiagnosed or symptomless ) is a major factor in their spread .
"most evidence for the presence of viruses in saliva comes from salivary culture , or serological responses , but nucleic acid amplification techniques such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) can now be used and have detected many previously undetectable virus infections .","such data for viruses in saliva are sparse so in the meantime epidemiological data and the presence of virus in saliva , nucleic acid , or antigens of microorganism have to be relied upon as circumstantial evidence ."
"respiratory infection caused by hadv in immunocompetent people is typically caused by hadv - 3 , mild and self - limited .","however , more recently hadv - 55 in particular has been found to cause severe communityacquired pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome in immunocompetent adults , mainly from china ."
there are a number of human coronaviruses and they usually cause respiratory infections - mostly mild illnesses such as the common cold .,"coronaviruses are common viruses that can infect humans , and animals as diverse as bats and alpacas ."
"in west africa , the kissing of dead bodies is a traditional burial practice and can promote ebov transmission .","no cases of ebola transmission through deep kissing have been confirmed , although there must surely be a very high potential risk ."
"hand , foot , and mouth disease hand , foot , and mouth disease ( hfmd ) is an exanthem on the hands and feet with associated fever and oral lesions .","children with coackie a2 infections mostly present with herpangina only , and have fewer central nervous system complications and a better outcome than those with enterovirus ( ev71 ) infections ."
"enteroviruses are highly contagious , spread mainly by oral oral and fecal oral routes , and typically affect children under years old .",poliovirus was found in secretions from the upper respiratory tract and salivary swabs of household contacts of patients with virologically proven poliomyelitis .
"in eerimental animal models , coackie b virus was recovered in the whole saliva of rabbits as early as minutes after injection of virus into an ear vein and it was suggested that virus might be transmitted by saliva of viremic animals without infection of the oropharyngeal tissues .","ev71 is an important public health problem in asia as it spreads easily to close contacts and may cause central nervous system involvement , serious illness , or death ."
transmission to humans is usually by inhalation of aerosolized viruscontaminated rodent excreta .,hantavirus rna has also been detected in saliva of patients with hfrs and from puumala hantavirus infected people .
"it has been speculated that andv may be secreted into saliva , which might be a transmission route for andv between humans , but there is no reliable evidence , and there is some evidence of salivary inhibitory factors .","human - to - human transmission of hantaviruses appears rare , except in the case of andes virus ( andv ) ."
illness may be prolonged with chronic carriage and can also cause complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma .,"hepatitis b and c ( formerly hepatitis non - a , non - b ) virus infections however are transmitted mainly parenterally - blood transfusion and intravenous drug use being the most frequent risk factors , though sexual transmission may also occur ."
hav - rna may be found in oral fluids though it is present in low frequencies in saliva from hav - infected patients while others failed to detect it in saliva obtained during a hepatitis a virus outbreak .,it seems that saliva can be a potential route of transmission .
it has been implied that transmission may be directly from mouth - to - mouth by kissing or by the exchange of saliva on chewed toys and candies but no infections have been confirmed in susceptible persons with an intact oral mucosa who were orally eed to hbvinfected saliva or students who had oral eures to hbsagpositive saliva via contaminated musical instruments .,hepatitis b surface antigen ( hbsag ) was found in saliva of % of patients with severe hepatitis and in % of chronic carriers .
no case of transmission by hcv after mouth - to - mouth ventilation has been described .,hcv - rna in saliva is associated with the level of serum viral load but not with periodontal or liver disease severity .
", 118 hsv - 1 transmission via saliva is thought to be common and though evidence is sparse it has been transmitted by mouth - tomouth ventilation .","however , it is more likely that uninfected adults may contract hsv by kissing or sexual practices but there is little hard evidence to confirm this ."
hsv - 2 typically causes anogenital herpetic lesions and infection is usually transmitted sexually .,"as with hsv - 1 , hsv - 2 is capable of causing both anogenital and oral disease ."
ebv - dna loads in saliva during convalescence are high and associated with continued infectivity .,"there is a high prevalence of ebv in saliva and throat washings from healthy children and adults in some geographical regions and by adulthood , at least % of all people are seropositive to ebv ."
"the possibility of interpersonal hiv contagion by saliva is often still a common belief and , e . g . , some parents fear transmitting hiv to , or catching infection from their children through saliva .",human immunodeficiency viruses cause hiv disease and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( aids ) .
"hpv can cause benign warty lesions on oral and other epithelia , and some oncogenic types are implicated in cervical , anogenital , and oropharyngeal cancers .",a number of viruses have been examined for possible roles in oral carcinogenesis .
"sporadic human cases of avian a ( h5n6 ) , a ( h10n8 ) , and a ( h6n1 ) have also emerged .",saliva in people with influenza may well contain the virus .
outbreaks of measles communities such as in gypsy - travelers are well recognized .,"the measles virus causes measles , a highly contagious disorder , usually in children manifesting with fever and rash sometimes with more serious complications ."
"hmpv is found in saliva , more in children within days of onset of symptoms than later .",", although we found no reliable evidence of the virus transmission by saliva , it is highly likely ."
"lesions are seen mainly in children , sexually active adults , and those who are immunocompromised .",molluscum contagiosum is a benign poxvirus infection of the skin or very occasionally the mucosae .
the raised salivary load of mumps virus suggests a risk for transmission .,"mumps virus can be isolated from saliva and throat swabs from days before to days after the onset of parotitis , isolation rates are much greater closer to parotitis onset , the viral load decreasing substantially over the first days after illness onset and becoming extremely low thereafter ."
there can be feco - oral transmission of nov but salivary transmission appears poorly documented .,"it can also survive for months in contaminated water , weeks on hard surfaces , and up to days on fabrics ."
"furthermore , hpivs can also cause more severe illness , such as croup or pneumonia .","human parainfluenza viruses ( hpivs ) are rna viruses in a group of four distinct serotypes , which commonly cause respiratory illnesses in infants and young children but anyone can suffer hpiv illness of fever , runny nose , and cough ."
"rotaviruses can be found in saliva and other body fluids in infected patients , presumably transmitting infection .","in newborns and infants immunized against rotavirus , serum and saliva iga antibodies conceivably assist in protection ."
"ttv was first identified in a patient with non - a - e hepatitis but the viruses are now known to be ubiquitous , with . 90% of adults worldwide infected .","it has been suggested that ttv infection is associated with many diseases , including some oral disease , with little evidence ."
"in africa , yellow fever occurs in countries and an epidemic in angola in caused serious concern and was spread by travelers to at least china , democratic republic of congo , kenya , and morocco .",at least half of severely affected patients who do not receive treatment die within days .
"as with so many viruses , most wnv infections are asymptomatic , but there is a risk of potentially lethal neurological disease .","wnv , a flavivirus , naturally maintained in a cycle between birds and mosquitoes , with occasional spillover by mosquito bites to humans , since isolated first in uganda , has spread widely including the united states and europe ."
zikv rna has been detected in saliva from patients with zika fever .,the magnitude of the current zikv epidemic has led to a declaration of a public health emergency of international concern by the who .
"nevertheless , this route may be one where the flaviviruses at least may well spread .","any risks of transmission from saliva appear not well - defined , and reliable evidence for virus transmission through kissing is sparse ."
"competing priorities and strategies that address economic growth , state security , human security and population health suggest that the relative import of health or development , and the impact each has on the other , remains contentious and forms what can best be described as the ' chicken or the egg ' debate : is development a necessary precursor to improvements in human health , or is human health necessary to achieve development ?",the position an institution or nation - state takes in this debate will dictate its policy approach .
a healthy population further contributes to economic well - being by creating opportunities for children to be educated .,"if children are likely to live into adulthood , parents are more likely to invest in education ."
it is thus a malleable state that must be built by adopting multiple avenues of influence and including multiple sectors within the scope of health - oriented policy .,"each of the three interpretations of health implies a different notion of what policy actions contribute to good or poor health , and will therefore influence policy formulation ."
neither the project of improving population health nor engaging in development is stagnant .,"given the variability of goals within both the health and development communities , such change in definition and utility is not surprising ."
"we will then examine how political forces and norms influenced and reformed the focus , scope , and actions of the world health organization ( who ) and international bank for reconstruction and development ( the ibrd , a . k . a .",we will examine the formation of global governance following world war ii by first looking at the political forces that informed the united nations charter .
"yersinia pestis , plague , presented one of the early challenges to international health .","infectious disease had long been a concern for international and domestic security , a concern which spurred the creation and coordination of specific codes to limit the spread of disease and mitigate its human and economic impacts ."
"under the quarantine law , incoming ships had to remain at anchor for forty days before they would be allowed to dock .",the city of venice instituted a formal quarantine system to control the plague epidemic .
interamerican cooperation solidified under the aegis of the pan american sanitary bureau ( stern and markel ) .,"in europe , the office international d ' hygi ne publique ( oihp ) in paris became the chief coordinator of public health activities , such as monitoring and assessing disease occurrence and possible risk factors , providing technical advice to address health risks and improve health outcomes , and coordinating different actors to address specific health threats ."
"it was a subject of debate in the late s and then re - emerged in health rhetoric following world war i , challenging the exclusivity of focus as practiced by adherents of bacteriology and germ theory .",a division in the health community emerged between those who focus on the individual causes of ill health and those who focus on social causes .
"social insurance , or social welfare , eanded the notion of state insurance to include other social aspects .","it is a social safety net which includes income support , nutritional support , provision of housing and access to medical care for highly vulnerable populations such as the elderly ( who no longer earn income ) , women , children and the poor whose physical or social circumstances prevent equal ability to access essential goods ."
"in social medicine , health became entwined with labor , employment , and the political economy - in other words with the broader development landscape .","the growth of social medicine , state insurance and social insurance was a countervailing force to the biomedical perspective that concentrated on a specific disease and a pharmacopic or biophysical cure ."
"neither the oihp nor the lnhc were able to operate during world war ii , and fell apart thereafter .","in the power vacuum which followed the close of war , public health campaigns focused on humanitarian aid efforts ( even before such a term had been coined ) and were delivered piecemeal ."
"internationally accepted norms were created which included the primacy of sovereignty in domestic affairs , the responsibility of collective action , and the duty of nation - states to strive to protect peace .",collective action would be used to mitigate social and economic conditions which could lead to regional or global conflict .
"with the formation of the un , the ideal of collective responsibility in protecting internationally defined norms was put forward .","( united nations ) to do this , the un charter provided rules to respect human rights , rules to respect the rights of sovereign , peace - loving nations , and an international forum for grievances and conflict mitigation ."
"it speaks to the promise not only of health , but of a minimal status of human well - being or development .",health is not limited to the ability to access medical care or be free from sickness .
the un would also disseminate information and resources to assist members in building social and economic conditions which would ensure prosperity and deter future conflict .,"the charter pledges to "" promote higher standards of living , full employment , and conditions of economic and social progress and development . """
"developing countries did not have individual political or economic power , but en masse controlled a newly empowered voting block which questioned the prevailing economic and political ideologies of development .","after three decades of development , % of the world ' s population resided in developing countries , but these countries controlled only % of global income ( united nations ) ."
"during the post war period , the global community engaged in reflection surrounding the collapse of global empires and independence of former colonies .","as independence movements took hold , questions arose not only about nation - building , but also about how to improve the quality of life across disparate topographical , political and social milieus , and about how best to achieve global security ."
"the controversy had its roots in a growing division among medical and policy leaders which pre - dated wwii , but was exacerbated by the post - war balance of power and growing division between capitalist and communist nation - states .",the writing of the who constitution was littered with controversy as to the scope of both the agency ' s power and the scope of understanding as to what makes for good health .
the question became whether or not the new international health agency should be given a charter which may permit clear authority in sectors not traditionally considered part of public health .,the strongest opposition to including social insurance within the scope of the who came from the united states and britain ( brunton ; gillespie ; kunitz ; weindling ; worboys ) .
"the who constitution provided for a broad purview in the topics which the agency could investigate as related to health and its determinants , but a modest role in terms of actual powers to implement policy .",gillespie points to a concession that allows the who to study social security in conjunction with other agencies as another action that was necessary to secure votes from european countries .
"the who can make recommendations and advocate specific policy approaches and research agendas and can call for international conventions and proffer binding treaties , but power to act upon recommendations remains the sovereign right of nation - states .","while the who has the power to adopt conventions , agreements and international health regulations , it lacks enforcement power ."
"during the post war years , malaria was eradicated in the united states , parts of europe , and the middle east , and declined in parts of latin america and some parts of asia ( gilles and warrell ; newman ) .","the vision of health with the anti - malaria campaign presented health as an outcome included agent , host and a broader ecology ."
the disease killed nearly one quarter of those whom it infected .,"at the time who launched its smallpox eradication campaign , % of the world ' s population was at risk of this disease ( who d ) ."
"by the early s , the number of member states in the un had more than doubled from its initial membership as a result of decolonization and formation of newly independent nations in the global south .",this ushered in the era of the new international economic order ( nieo ) which was a concerted effort by un members representing the global south to create a more just distribution of global economic power and resources between the global north and the global south .
"when we consider global change in primary care since the s , global immunization coverage and improved access to safe water and sanitation are clear achievements .",but the full promise of primary care is yet to be realized and gains that have been made are threatened .
"progress increasing global immunization coverage is one of the great success stories of public health , but it is not without a down side as evidenced by backsliding in immunization rates and continued loss of life to vaccine - preventable disease .",these two programs are emblematic of the successes and failures of primary health .
"if the damage is severe enough , the woman may not be able to have children , and may therefore lose social status and economic protection .","obstetric fistulas are another complication which , if not surgically mended , cause loss of bladder or bowel control among other sequelae ."
such complications may be a result of a condition developing because of the pregnancy .,"a study in zambia found that % of the referrals made to a teaching hospital were related to pregnancy complications , not childbirth ( who ) ."
"although access to contraception has risen from % of the population in the s to % of the population , there remains a large gap between need and availability .",family planning includes access to knowledge about reproduction as well as access to birth control methods .
"third , vaccinations are an efficient public health intervention in that there is a targeted group , minimal contact with the health system is necessary , and no major lifestyle changes are required ( who a ) .","this in turn relates to lower dependency ratios and improved standard of living and improved human development within the broader population ( who ( who , a ."
"ninety - five percent of who member states now provide hepatitis b vaccines , although with mixed coverage rates ( who a , b ) .","since the launch of the global polio eradication initiative , polio cases dropped by % - five million people were spared paralysis associated with the disease ( who a ) ."
vaccination coverage dropped by % or more in countries since ( lee et al .,"the vaccination programs are showing strain and , in some cases , losing ground as financing dries up and personnel are no longer trained ."
vaccination entails a one ( to three ) time encounter with the medical system ; maternal health entails a bare minimum of one but frequently more contacts .,maternal health is less clearly defined and associated with no single intervention .
"the sub - field of social epidemiology , which examines "" how social conditions give rise to patterns of health and disease in individuals "" , became firmly established ( berkman and kawachi : 10 ) .",health was once again understood to be the product of numerous factors but increasingly these factors were seen to occur outside the geographic and institutional boundaries of any one nation state .
it serves developed as well as developing countries as witnessed by the us $ billion loan to iceland initiated in ( anderson ) .,"rather , the imf is engaged in macro - economic management of monetary and fiscal policy , longer term debt negotiation and restructuring , and global financial stability ."
"at its inception , the programmatic focus was to rebuild the physical and economic structure of europe and asia .","allied bombing left a devastated landscape which necessitated construction of infrastructure for transport , communications , commerce , and governance ."
"by the early s , the world bank became increasingly focused on programs to reduce the number of people living in poverty and providing for the necessities of a minimal standard of living , or basic needs , which included caloric intake , housing , and income generation .","despite increased levels of urbanization and industrialization , many poor countries remained poor and inequities in wealth distribution increased ."
"finally , there is an era of using poverty reduction strategies ( prs ) for development .",this is followed by the world bank as a health systems authority .
"the threat was a grand scale of default which could have ruined large commercial lenders based in the developed world , and destabilized the global economy .",the solution to what was feared to be a global economic collapse was intervention by the world bank and imf .
such stability would come through a focus on economic growth rather than investment in human capabilities .,"conditionalities for receipt of loan adjustment and financial assistance were the order of the day , with an eye towards fiscal balance and monetary stability and market liberalization ."
"first , it would reduce the imbalance in government revenues versus eenditures - an imbalance which was viewed as especially problematic in states such as chile with entrenched welfare programs ( ewig and kay ) .","second , such reductions would lower government consumption and thereby bring down inflation ( gershman and irwin ) ."
it was during this latter period when the world bank presented a cohesive health platform and rose to the fore of global health actors .,"this occurred when the bank revisited its previous work which , rather than furthering the mission of poverty alleviation was found to foster inequality and breed poverty ( world bank ) ."
"in this , the world bank perspective differs from the who - espoused notion that health is a human right which therefore , based solely on its inherent and natural value , should be at the apex of policy concerns .","economic growth has traditionally been of central concern to the world bank , and it was the dominant focus of this particular world development report ."
"importantly , the report departed from the neoliberal ideology which guided the saps in that it discouraged conditionalities for receipt of funds , argued for investment in human capital , argued in favor of equitable distribution of health care goods by programs targeting the poorest % of the population , and acknowledged the different capabilities of poor versus very poor nations .","the sustainability of health care could be achieved by using cost effective methods and cost recovery mechanisms such as user fees , an idea that was in keeping with free market principles ."
"at the same time , however , the world bank emphasized the mixed public and private financing for health care vis - - vis insurance , and the introduction of private provision of health care , competition , and cost recovery mechanisms including user fees which created financial burdens upon the poor .",the bank ' s directives encouraged public financing and provision of primary education especially for girls .
"a major criticism of the bank ' s entr e into health care was that the policies put forward commodified health and , as such , was counter to the ideal of health being both a basic human right and provision of the same being an obligation of government .","further , the argument that the bank ' s policies were swayed largely by donor nations , to the disadvantage of the recipient nations , continued ."
these actions would allow health care to be better targeted towards the poor .,"decentralization would shift power away from the administrative center , typically in the urban capital , and disrupt problems which cronyism and patronage wrecked in terms of hiring , concentration of personnel , and flow of financial resources ."
evidence shows that the cost sharing mechanism essentially excluded the poor from accessing health care ( farmer and bertrand ; oppong ; shaw and ainsworth ; world bank ) .,these mechanisms included the introduction of user fees on a sliding scale and self - funding for insurance .
the result was the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) .,"during the writing of the first edition of this book , the united states was in the process of creating a major health care initiative to provide equitable access to health care through public and private means ."
some see this as a failure of the who to maintain an interest in broad social determinants of health ( armada et al .,the who espoused the program of health system reform during the s .
"further , critics argued that the financial igos adopted a cookie cutter approach to macro adjustment policy which failed to account for different cultural and geographic milieus , and institutional capacity which contribute to a nation ' s prospects for economic growth .","although the extent of saps impact on health and human development was not fully understood at the time of its writing , the world development report did address this latter concern by making a case for addressing each nation ' s unique capacities ."
"the continued dissection of the failures of saps and development programs , growing alarm about the negative impacts of globalization , and increased acceptance of a broader definition of development to include increasing capabilities created an opening for multiple disciplines to contribute to the dialogue about improving development and human well - being .",researchers turned to anthropology and the role of culture to elain successes and failures in the arenas of development and political science .
the growing discussion of health in state and human security brought the global community back to the early ideal of health being necessary for global peace and stability as seen in the un charter and in the office international d ' hygi ne publique and the league of nations before that .,"towards the close of the th century , the developed world was especially concerned about the implications of an aging population on health and financial security of the household and government institutions ."
"the number of internationally notifiable diseases eanded to include wild polio , novel strains of human influenza , and sars .","in addition , member states must notify who of any "" public health emergency of international concern "" ( pheic ) which includes biological , chemical , infectious , and radioactive threats ."
the international community chastised china for failing to report a public health threat which did indeed create a global crisis ( who ) .,"critics said that had china reported the initial outbreak , actions could have been taken to limit the geographic spread , health impact and economic damage ."
in the s the who and undp tried to redefine health as an input into development whereas the world bank emphasized economic growth ' s pre - eminence in triggering human development and eanding economic opportunities .,the perspective shift associated with the human development and human security models created research and debate but encouraged little in terms of reorienting international health policy until the scares associated with the anthrax attacks in the united states in and the sars epidemic showed that economic and military strength were no protection from global threats from disease .
social and political stability may be at risk if a society is confronted with excess morbidity or mortality ( peterson ) .,"as military men and women become sick or die , the military weakens and may not be adequately able to respond to other security challenges ."
the st century began with two seminal events which firmly united health and economic development as being in a symbiotic relationship from which neither could be divorced from the other .,these two events were the formation of the commission on macroeconomics and health ( chm ) and the millennium development summit which resulted in the mdgs .
"there are large social benefits to ensuring high levels of health coverage of the poor , including spillovers to wealthier members of the society .","( who : 16 ) the cmh became a leading researcher on links between socioeconomics and health , as well as an advocate for addressing macroeconomic policies and structures which have the power to impact population health through intended and unintended consequences ."
this meeting focused on multiple pathways to achieving sustainable human development .,it addressed the ideals of building human capacity and human capital as well as global sustainability .
the conceptualization of health as an input and an outcome to other desirable goods was complete .,"the millennium summit and mdgs were a hallmark in development and health in that they represented a convergence of the north and the south , elicitly addressed the cyclical relationship between health and economic development , and invited public - private partnerships ."
the quantitative targets in the mdgs failed to account for baseline regional disparities and placed unfair eectations on those countries that were the worse off ( un system task team b ) .,"for example , a country with a higher percentage of its population living in extreme poverty would have to have a much greater reduction in absolute number of people living in poverty to reach the % reduction goal than would a nation with a lower percentage of people living in poverty ."
this number dropped to % by ( un ; un pg ; un system task team a ) .,"while critics note that poverty reduction in china accounts for a significant portion of this change , the decrease remains import ."
"this began with the united nations conference on sustainable development in june , the rio + 20 conference , at which participants called for a process that would include input from multiple stake - holders .","as a result , the un established the united nations open working group ( owg ) for creating the new development agenda ."
these countries were grouped by geographic region and rotated meeting attendance among group members ( sustainable development ) .,"the owg sought input from multiple stakeholders both within and outside of the un system via surveys , discussions , and on - line discussions ."
"the sdgs consist of goals with separate targets that include human rights , equality and sustainability as core values ( un general assembly ; un system task team a ) .","the goals purport to focus on inclusive social and economic development , environmental sustainability , and peace and security ( un general assembly ; un system task team a ) ."
"goal : end poverty in all its forms everywhere goal : end hunger , achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture goal : ensure healthy lives and promote well - being for all at all ages goal : ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning goal : achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls goal : ensure access to water and sanitation for all goal : ensure access to affordable , reliable , sustainable and modern energy for all goal : promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth , employment and decent work for all goal : build resilient infrastructure , promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation goal : reduce inequality within and among countries goal : make cities inclusive , safe , resilient and sustainable goal : ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns goal : take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts goal : conserve and sustainably use the oceans , seas and marine resources addressing climate change is both an elicit goal ( goal ) and an aspect of six other goals .","however , they also have a new emphasis on south - south partnerships and capabilities , and highlight the potential contributions from middle income countries , as well as the unique challenges they face ."
"like the who , it also uses the mdgs to guide some of its operations .","in the st century , the who was strengthened in its ideal of health as a human right by the mdgs and the work of the cmh by international financial institutions and the broad international political community ."
"health , livelihoods and adequate quality of life are held to be basic rights .","in the new global vision , economic well - being is more than gpd growth , and health is clearly held to be both an input to and outcome of development ."
"drawing on the lessons learned from previous disaster and disease outbreak studies over the past two decades , in the following article we review research related to social psychological assessment of community attitudes , knowledge , and beliefs associated with the recent ebola outbreak and other public health threats , and discuss the use of this information to assist in future disaster planning and crisis communications .","psychologists , physicians , and others in the healthcare field need to be aware of these developments and involved with preparations related to mitigating the psychological impact of ebola disease outbreaks among different populations , as well as other potential public health threats in the future ."
"for example , research suggested that % of new york adults , approximately , 000 persons , suffered a panic attack during the world trade center ( wtc ) attacks .","other studies , conducted nationally and within the new york area following the wtc attacks , also reported widespread psychological distress ( schlenger et al . , ; silver et al . , ) ."
"to examine the social psychological aspects of bioterrorism threats in new york following the wtc attacks a decade ago , we studied a random sample of nearly , 700 adult residents ( boscarino , adams , figley et al . , ) .","despite this realization , most of the public health preparedness activities to date have focused on the technological and biomedical aspects of these events , not the psychological impact ( bravata et al . , ; committee on r & d needs for improving civilian medical response to chemical and biological terrorism incidents , ; keim & kaufmann , ; us department of homeland security , ) ."
"we note that past disaster research findings are consistent with terror management theory , a social psychological concept , which suggests that a key to understanding reactions to environmental threats is understanding of the fear of death ( pyszczynski , greenberg , & solomon , ; strachan et al . , ) .","similar to stress - process theory boscarino et al . , ) , this fear is affected by social factors , level of education , self - esteem , and social support - - factors responsible for buffering individuals against traumatic episodes and the subsequent adverse cognitive processes associated with these events pyszczynski et al . , ; strachan et al . , ) ."
"of course , this was the same challenge with the outbreak of hiv disease in the s ( boscarino , ; boscarino & diclemente , ) .","consequently , risk communications would need to incorporate this uncertainty , not ignore it , much like meteorologists do in forecasting extreme weather events using various "" warning systems , "" such as with hurricanes or tornados ( rosenbaum , ) ."
"the other chief method used in public health disaster research is the post - disaster research registry ( institute of medicine and us department of health and human services , ; jordan et al . , ; north et al . , ) .","registries are disease surveillance systems chiefly developed by epidemiologists to track disease outcomes over time ( rothman , greenland , & lash , ) ."
post - event health surveillance also should be planned in the aftermath of major incidents .,"given current threats and emerging knowledge related to both environmental and humanmade disasters , we think that interventions should be considered , including community , workplace and family - based programs and public service announcements , based on new and existing research ( boscarino , adams , figley et al . , ; boscarino et al . , ; engel & katon , ; foa et al . , ) ."
"psychologists , physicians , and others in the public health sector need to be aware of these developments and become more involved with preparations related to the psychosocial mitigation of disease outbreaks , and other public health threats in the future .","in summary , while there is concern related to adverse events following the outbreak of evd and gaps in knowledge currently exist , the research tools needed to mitigate the impact of these threats are available ( boscarino , adams , figley et al . , ; boscarino et al . , ; engel & katon , ; foa et al . , ) ."
"viruses like respiratory syncytial virus , human rhinovirus , human metapneumovirus , parainfluenza viruses , and influenza may act as sole pathogens or may predispose to bacterial pneumonia by a variety of mechanisms .","new , emerging , or reemerging viral pathogens occasionally cause outbreaks of severe respiratory tract infection in children ."
"in the u . s . , there are about to million episodes per year , with more than , 000 hospitalizations .","among immunocompetent children , cap may be caused by a wide variety of microbes , including many viruses , "" typical "" bacteria ( e . g . , streptococcus pneumoniae ) , atypical bacteria ( e . g . , mycoplasma pneumoniae ) , mycobacterium tuberculosis and related species , and fungi such as histoplasma capsulatum [ 5 - 10 , ] ."
"development of cap caused by bacterial pathogens that have colonized the upper airway may be facilitated by viral respiratory tract infections that damage ciliated respiratory epithelium and interfere with normally protective mucociliary clearance mechanisms , augment adhesion of bacterial pathogens to respiratory epithelial cells , directly diminish the effectiveness of neutrophils or other components of innate or adaptive immunity , allow overgrowth of bacteria in the nasal passages that increases the likelihood of aspiration into the lower respiratory tract , and / or facilitate translocation of bacteria in the upper airways across mucosal barriers into the bloodstream , with secondary bacteremic seeding of the lung parenchyma .",severe cases of rsv bronchiolitis requiring mechanical ventilation often have bacterial coinfection .
this seems especially true for viral etiologies of bronchiolitis in young children .,"this review focuses on recent studies that provide insights into various aspects of viral infections that are associated with subsequent typical bacterial cap , including seasonal and pandemic h1n1 influenza , and on recent studies on complications of cap ."
at least one respiratory pathogen was identified in of patients ( 97 %) .,"bacteria were isolated in % of samples , viruses in %, and both in %."
"when bacterial - viral coinfection was identified , s . pneumoniae - rhinovirus was the most frequent combination ( 16 %) .","a major limitation of this study was probable contamination of many of the bacterial cultures with nasoor oropharyngeal flora that commonly colonize the nasal passages or oropharynx but sometimes are etiologies of pneumonia ( i . e . , s . aureus , s . pneumoniae , m . catarrhalis , nontypeable h . influenzae ) ."
"at least one virus was isolated in patients ( 73.4 %) , and ( 30 %) patients had two or more viruses isolated .","nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained at admission from , 034 patients and tested for respiratory viruses by rt - pcr ."
viruspositive patients were more likely than virus - negative patients to present with hypoxia and wheezing .,"length of hospital stay , duration of oxygen therapy , and duration of fever did not differ among cap cases associated with rsv , hrv , hbov , or hmpv in children < 18 months old ."
"in a sixcenter study in south africa during and , nasopharyngeal or oral specimens from , 173 patients with severe acute respiratory infection were evaluated with a - virus multiplex pcr test .","most of the patients were children with physician - diagnosed lower respiratory tract infection ( lrti ) , although adults were included as well ."
"children may shed viruses for a prolonged period , and viral detection may simply represent asymptomatic persistence .","nevertheless , these studies are consistent with others that have demonstrated a variety of viral etiologies associated with lower respiratory tract infection , often but not always with evidence of concomitant bacterial infection ."
influenza virus infections have long been associated with secondary bacterial cap .,a recently published retrospective cohort study examined the impact of seasonal influenza virus infection on hospitalized children with complicated pneumonia requiring pleural fluid drainage .
"in multivariable analysis , influenza coinfection was associated with higher odds of intensive care unit admission and need for mechanical ventilations and vasoactive infusions , as well as a longer hospital stay .","in this cohort , s . aureus was the most common bacteria associated with influenza coinfection ( n = 24 ) , although s . pneumoniae was identified almost as often ( n = 14 ) ."
"this was most marked for - to - year - olds and - to - year - olds , where the pandemic ratios were five - and sixfold higher , respectively , than the average of preceding seasonal influenza years .","among , 479 children hospitalized with influenza in regions of the u . s . that were monitored by the emerging infections program of the cdc , % had an underlying medical condition , of which asthma ( 32 % of cases ) was the most common ."
"in denver , co , during the second wave peak in october , there were cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in children - 19 years old , mostly pneumonia , but only such cases during the peak of the preceding seasonal influenza outbreak in february .","hospitalizations for pneumococcal pneumonia increased - fold over baseline for children to years old in the u . s . , the largest relative increase among any age group , during the second wave of pandemic influenza in the fall of ."
"in a similar series of children admitted to four thai hospitals , infiltrates on chest radiographs were present in ( 77 %) .","among infants < 6 months old hospitalized in texas with laboratory - confirmed pandemic influenza a in , of ( 15 %) were diagnosed with bacterial coinfection on admission ."
recent examples include the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) coronavirus outbreak in and human coronavirus nl63 in .,"hbov was first identified in , but its precise role as a respiratory pathogen remains unconfirmed ."
"specimens from five children tested positive for human enterovirus ( hev68 ) , one of whom also had evidence of pneumococcal infection .","after routine studies conducted by the arizona department of health services failed to identify a pathogen , seven nasopharyngeal samples were referred to the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) for further testing ."
"in , a pediatric hospital in philadelphia identified an unusually large number of children with hrv infection , with children testing positive for hrv between august and october .",hrv was recovered from more than twice the proportion of samples than in the same time period during the previous year .
"a recent seroprevalence study in in canada showed that many adolescents and young adults , but not children under years or adults over years old , have antibodies that are cross - reactive with this strain .",this strain appears closely related to an influenza a variant that circulated in the mid - 1 9 9 0 s .
"this likely has been due to a combination of factors , including advances in health care delivery and availability of supportive care and antimicrobial agents , as well as increased availability of vaccines that can prevent h . influenzae type b and many pneumococcal infections .","from to , global annual deaths from pneumonia in children less than years old decreased by about , 000 ."
"blood cultures were obtained in about half ( interquartile range , % - 64 %) .","the majority of children with cap at each hospital had chest radiography ( interquartile range , % - 81 %) and complete blood counts ( interquartile range , % - 74 %) ."
"most of the children with cap during this study period in received a cephalosporin either alone or in combination with a macrolide , vancomycin , or clindamycin .",the recently published clinical practice guideline for pediatric cap recommends ampicillin or penicillin g for treatment of children in the u . s . hospitalized with uncomplicated cap who have been fully immunized and live in areas that lack high - level penicillin resistance among invasive pneumococci .
"one multiplex test for viruses , m pneumoniae , and bordetella pertussis that is fully automated and uses a selfcontained pouch that can be processed within an hour is currently available in the u . s . .",multiplex pcr tests increase the proportion of children with cap for whom a viral infection is identified .
there is growing evidence that the risk of serious bacterial infection is low in children with laboratory - confirmed viral infection .,"this may be true especially for infants and young children who test positive for influenza , rsv , piv , or adv and have no other indications for antimicrobial therapy ."
"the vast majority of children who develop cap recover fully , even when there are severe bacterial coinfections , provided these are managed appropriately .","abnormalities on pulmonary function testing may persist for months to years after rsv or other viral lrti in some infants and young children , but whether symptomatic lrti is simply a predictor versus etiology of subsequent abnormalities remains unclear ."
recently developed rapid diagnostic tests with short processing times may permit more judicious use of antimicrobial agents in children with apparent cap .,"due to the difficulty in distinguishing viral and bacterial etiologies of cap , especially in young children , antibiotics often are overprescribed for viral lrti ."
"criteria for hospital discharge , transition from intravenous to oral therapy , and use of viral and bacterial diagnostic tests in management decisions need further development .","in the u . s . , greater standardization of care for children with cap is a reasonable eectation that may be facilitated by the clinical practice guideline ."
"a current example is das181 , which acts at the level of the host , rather than the microbe , by blockade of influenza virus binding to sialic acid residues on respiratory epithelial cells .",development of new antiviral agents with novel mechanisms of action is needed .
"the potential for new viruses to emerge or become human pathogens may increase , and clusters of unelained respiratory illness should always be reported to appropriate public health agencies .","in the next few decades , climate change , environmental air pollution in urban areas , and economic or political upheavals that may impact population - level nutritional health , access to health care , and , potentially , seasonality and other epidemiological aspects of some respiratory viruses may become important factors regarding cap and other infections in children ."
"the analogues contained either dinitrile or diester groups at the imidazole , 5 - positions , and many of which possessed an acyclic sugar or sugar phosphonate moiety at the imidazole - position .",the ic values of the most active compounds ranged from to g / ml .
the inoculum was removed after h and replaced by a % methylcellulose - medium overlay .,vero cells in - well plates were inoculated with serial - fold dilutions of supernatant .
"cell growth inhibition or cytotoxicity was determined by the - ( 4,5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2,5 - diphenyl - 2 h - tetrazoliumbromide ( mtt ) method .","mtt solution ( 50 l , mg / ml pbs ) was added to the remaining supernatant of the cells from which an aliquot of supernatant was taken for measuring virus rna or infectious particles concentration ."
the concentrations required to inhibit virus replication by % ( ic ) or % ( ic ) were calculated by fitting a sigmoidal curve to the data following logarithmic transformation of the drug concentration .,curve fitting was performed by probit regression analysis using statgraphics plus software ( statistical graphics inc . ) .
"this article presents age , geographic , and temporal variations in - 1919 and influenza severity , presents and discusses ecologic evidence in favor of the hypothesis to influenza lethality advanced here , suggests biologic mechanisms capable of elaining it , retrospectively , proposes co - circulation between the pandemic and a seasonal ( h3 ? )",with seasonal viruses immunologically related to ones that had circulated in the past and primed particular population birth - cohorts .
"however , neither of these hypotheses accounts for the age - distribution of severe cases and deaths or for the geographic and other variations in rates and elosiveness of mortality during the pandemic .",current elanations to the high - 1919 mortality involve either a higher pathogenicity of the virus or bacterial superinfection in the absence of adequate therapeutic resources .
"in , severe cases and deaths have spared individuals born before ( oldest than ) , concentrating among those born in years of greater h3 ( post - 1968 ) and h2 ?","azambuja suggested that the high pathogenicity of the ( h1 ) influenza virus among young adults in - 1919 might have re - sulted from an immune response that went awry , in birth - cohorts originally primed by the influenza viruses emerging during the - 1890 pandemic ( according to sero - epidemiologic studies , possibly an h3 virus ) ."
this paper introduces a second contributing factor to elain the epidemiology of influenza severity and mortality .,"birth - cohort priming , while capable of elaining the age - distribution of severe cases and deaths , does not elain the variation in the size of the outbreaks in different places or groups of people , in a same pandemic ."
"the main characteristic of the influenza pandemic , besides its enormous mortality toll , was the unusual age distribution of the influenza deaths .","while the incidence of respiratory illness was highest in children under years of age , dropping towards ages - 24 , rising to a second small peak at ages - 40 and then declining as individuals aged , mortality from influenza and pneumonia was exceptionally concentrated in young adults ."
"in , the first confirmed cases of a / h1n1 infection in the world happened in march , in the united states .","but the h1n1 strain responsible for the current outbreak possibly circulated among humans for several months before being identified as a new strain of flu , and possibly infected people as early as january in mexico ."
"variation in mortality across different countries were also significant until september of , with higher rates occurring in mexico , argentina , uruguay , and rio grande do sul / brazil than in the united states and european countries .","significant variations occurred in the geographic distribution of cases and deaths within the state , with areas heavily hit and others completely spared from severe disease and deaths ."
co - circulation of new and seasonal influenza viruses were also documented in mexico .,"in rio grande do sul , in the winter , the new h1n1 co - circulated with seasonal viruses in a proportion : 1 ."
"in - 1919 , historical levels of mortality from cardiovascular , renal and respiratory diseases was the only factor associated with the differences found in the sizes of pandemic outbreaks among us cities .",elevated mortality from those chronic conditions could be taken as an indicative of high levels of influenza circulation .
"chen and cols studying immunity to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus , murine cytomegalovirus and influenza a virus , in mouse models of respiratory viral infections , showed that ' ' heterologous immunity induced two patterns of disease outcome dependent on the specific virus infection sequence : improved , if the acute response switched from a neutrophilic to a lymphocytic response or worsened , if it switched from a mild to a severe lymphocytic response "" ( , p . ) , and suggested that ' ' heterologous immunity occurs between many viruses , resulting in altered protective immunity and lung immunopathology , and that this is influenced by the specific virus infection sequence "" ( , p . ) .","as it is suggested to happen with dengue , an association of disease severity with the number and order of infections by different influenza strains could be elained by cross - reactive interference of memory cd4 + t cells on the c + t cell response against the secondary invader ."
"severe cases were concentrated in a - 4 weeks period during the winter , compared to a more extended period of circulation of the pandemic strain .","the southern hemisphere eerience with the a / h1n1 influenza pandemic strongly supports the link between co - circulation of influenza sub - types ( and co - or successive infections with different viruses in short period of time ) and the degree of occurrence and distribution of severe influenza cases among particularly vulnerable birth - cohorts ( those h2 and h3 primed , born after ) ."
"thus , co - circulation of different sub - types of influenza viruses , like happened after , probably occurred also during the beginning of the th century .",the much higher level of mortality in was most likely associated with the very high level of influenza activity documented in the united states and in great britain from - 1890 to the mid - 3 0 s .
"based on what was discussed here , an increase in severity of influenza cases in the northern hemisphere is to be eected , as the circulation of seasonal h3 strains increases .",a close observation of these trends may help us to disentangle the determinants of immunopathogenesis associated with influenza lethality .
"but the decline in influenza , respiratory and infectious diseases in general , and the rise in coronary heart disease towards the second half of the th century changed the research focus towards a group of diseases understood as degenerative as opposed to infection - related .","the influenza pandemic represents an opportunity to re - evaluate the current research trend , to go back to unsettled issues related to infectious diseases epidemics and learning from the past the lessons we still may learn ."
the sizes were assessed by % agarose gel electrophoresis and confirmed through the sequencing and analysis of the nucleotide sequence of each amplicon .,"the resulting amplicon sizes were bp for brv , bp for bcv , and bp for bvdv ."
"the . aln files were then converted to . meg files using mega and a neighbor - joining tree was constructed ( bootstrap replicates = , 000 ) using the kimura parameter method for pairwise deletion at uniform rates .",the nucleotide sequences were aligned using the clustal w x program and . aln files were generated .
"furthermore , the yearly frequency of the korean positive samples was constant : n = in both and , and n = in ( table ) .","korean bovine kobuvirus was markedly more prevalent , being detected in of the ( 34.6% ) fecal samples ."
"korean kobuvirus strains are found in three of the four lineages , with japanese and thailand strains being clustered together in the other lineage .","in conclusion , the findings of this study demonstrate the existence of four phylogenetic lineages of bovine kobuvirus ."
"the lungs normally have a dual blood supply , consisting of ) large pulmonary arteries that provide desaturated blood under low pressure for alveolar gas exchange and ) smaller bronchial arteries that provide oxygenated blood under systemic pressure for nutrition and oxygenation of the bronchi and lung tissue .","as the only solid organ transplant that does not undergo primary systemic ( i . e . , bronchial ) arterial revascularization at the time of surgery , lung transplants rely on the deoxygenated pulmonary arterial circulation and are especially vulnerable to the effects of injury and ischemia ."
the ongoing eure to various inhaled injurious agents may also predispose lung allografts to develop chronic rejection .,"lastly , the lung allografts have higher eure to immunogenic compounds , as compared to other organs , by ventilation ."
"re - transplantation is an option for highly selected cases , but it is generally not recommended due to suboptimal outcomes .","the management of pgd is largely supportive and includes lung - protective ventilation strategies ( low tidal volume , high positive end - eiratory pressure ) , judicious fluid management , inhaled nitric oxide or other inhaled pulmonary vasodilators to improve oxygenation , and extracorporeal life support ( ecls ) for the most severe cases ."
"the pulmonary embolism in setting of limited pulmonary reserve due to pgd , postoperative atelectasis , and single - lung transplantation can have catastrophic consequences , thus underscoring the need for early and appropriate vte prophylaxis after lung transplantation .","the reported incidences of pulmonary embolism ( pe ) and deep venous thrombosis ( dvts ) postlung transplantation are approximately - 15% and - 45% , respectively ."
"the diagnosis can be made with computed tomography ( ct ) pulmonary angiography , ventilation - perfusion scan , or by documentation of dvt by doppler ultrasonography .","the treatment is the same as for vtes in general , although the risk of postoperative bleeding needs to be weighed against the risk of pe ."
inadvertent injury to various intrathoracic nerves during lung transplantation is a well - recognized and common complication .,the most commonly affected structures are the phrenic and vagus nerves .
"diaphragmatic dysfunction as a consequence of phrenic nerve injury can present clinically with dyspnea , hypoventilation and hypercapnia , and hypoxemia or as difficult wean from the ventilator .",diaphragmatic paralysis can lead to increased length of stay and ventilator dependence .
"the potential management strategies include minimizing transit delaying medications ( e . g . , opioids ) , the use of pro - motility agents , placement of post - pyloric feeding tubes , botulinum toxin injection to the pylorus , and surgical fundoplication in conjunction with pyloroplasty .",a diagnosis is usually made by a nuclear medicine gastric emptying study .
"the risk factors for the development of pleural complications include previous thoracic surgery , pleural adhesions , and donor - recipient size mismatch .","these complications usually arise as a result of the pleural disruption from the surgery itself , though rejection and immunosuppressive regimens may also play a role ."
these entities have all been associated with negative patient outcomes and are treated with a range of medical and surgical procedures depending on the condition and severity .,"in general , all pleural effusions need to be evaluated to rule out complicated effusions such as hemothorax , empyema , and chylothorax ."
vascular anastomotic complications can arise either early or late in the post - transplant course and can have very severe adverse consequences .,"pulmonary artery stenosis can be secondary to mechanical kinking , disruption , or narrowing of the anastomosis , sometimes due to the particulars of donor anatomy or due to thrombosis ."
this entity should be included in the differential diagnosis of a patient with acute pulmonary edema post - lung transplantation .,diagnosis is usually made by transesophageal echocardiography or ct angiography .
"later complications include bronchopleural , bronchovascular and bronchomediastinal fistulae , excessive granulation tissue , bronchomalacia , and airway stenosis .","airway anastomotic complications do not seem to be associated with decreased survival ; however , they do negatively impact quality of life and significantly increase healthcare resource utilization ."
"patients can present with wheezing , cough , post - obstructive pneumonias , decline in pulmonary function tests ( pfts ) , and stridor .",the bronchial narrowing can also present distal to the anastomosis causing lobar lobe collapse .
"despite the use of potent and novel immunosuppressive regimens , the incidence of chronic rejection and long - term survival post - transplant has remained essentially unchanged over the last two decades .",the chronic rejection of lung allograft is the major hurdle to long - term survival after transplantation .
flexible bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsies is the gold standard for diagnosis .,current imaging modalities are not diagnostic but may reveal useful findings such as infiltrates and ground - glass opacities .
"amr is described as the combination of the following : donor - specific anti - hla antibodies , evidence of complement deposition in allograft biopsies , histologic tissue injury , and clinical allograft dysfunction .","once the aforementioned antibodies bind their receptors in the graft , they are capable of binding complement , specifically c1q ."
"the mainstay of amr management involves depletion and / or neutralization of anti - hla antibodies by plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin ( ivig ) , followed by rituximab infusion .",rituximab is an anti - cd - 20 chimeric antibody that targets b - cell function and can decrease production of antibodies .
clad is predominantly a consequence of chronic rejection and is a major hurdle to long - term survival .,the term chronic lung allograft dysfunction ( clad ) encompasses pathologies that lead to chronic dysfunction of lung allograft .
"it is reported to occur in up to % of lung transplant recipients at years post - transplant , and it is a major cause of morbidity , negative impact in quality of life , and increased costs .",bos is the predominant form of clad and is the number one cause of death after year of transplantation .
the diagnosis can be made conditionally without histopathology ( bos ) or definitively with histopathology ( bo ) .,"risk factors include prior episodes of acute rejection , cytomegalovirus infection ( cmv ) , community - acquired respiratory viruses ( carv ) infection , history of pgd , isolation of aspergillus fumigatus and pseudomonas aeruginosa , the presence of gerd , and other immune - mediated factors ."
the treatment of bos is disappointing in terms of outcomes ; often success is measured in slowing the decline or stabilizing it .,"beyond augmentation of immunosuppression , azithromycin , extracorporeal photopheresis , montelukast , methotrexate , aerosolized cyclosporine , alemtuzumab , and total lymphoid irradiation have been used with limited success ."
"these patients present with predominant restriction , and the survival is worse as compared to patients with bos .",ras has been more recently described and occurs in less than a third of patients with clad .
"this increased risk is in part related to the increased risk of cancer due to underlying disease ( e . g . , emphysema , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ) .",the single - lung transplant recipients are at higher risk of development of lung cancer in their native lungs .
"the reported incidence of non - hodgkin lymphoma post - lung transplant has been as high as cases / 100,000 person - years .","post - transplant lymphoproliferative disorders ( ptld ) encompass an array of diseases involving clonal eansion of b lymphocytes , ranging from polyclonal benign disorders to aggressive malignant lymphomas ."
"it can be secondary to systemic infection with mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma , which break down urea as an energy source , generating ammonia as a waste product .",this likely represents a donor - derived infection and can respond to early appropriate antibiotic treatment .
a close and judicious glycemic control is indicated in this patient population .,the development of dm in lung transplant recipients is associated with decreased survival .
ckd is also associated with higher mortality in lung transplant recipients .,"the risk factors for development of chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) include older age , dm , hypertension , smoking history , and use of nephrotoxic drugs ."
the strategies to prevent and reverse bone losses after transplant need to be proactively implemented .,"treatment includes adequate supplementation of calcium , vitamin d , use of bisphosphonates , enhancing physical activity , and minimizing contributing medications , if possible ."
"these risk factors should be carefully managed to decrease the impact of cad and related complications , with a combination of lifestyle modifications and specific medical therapies .","as they progress into long - term survival , these patients have cumulative impact from risk factors previously discussed in this chapter , namely , dm , dyslipidemia , ckd , hypertension , chronic corticosteroid use , and other immunosuppressive medication ."
"muscle weakness , deconditioning , and sarcopenia are associated with adverse outcomes and decrease in quality of life .",this issue seems to be consistent in lung transplant recipients and independent of pre - transplant diagnosis and surgery type .
"lung transplant recipients are at an increased risk for acquiring infections due to the immunosuppressed state , constant environmental pathogen eure , decreased cough reflex , impaired mucociliary clearance , and lymphatic disruption .",infectious complications are responsible for about a quarter of post - transplant deaths .
"other commonly encountered bacterial infections in this patient population include pleural space infections , blood stream infections ( bsis ) , and soft tissue infections .",the bsis and empyema carry a high risk of morbidity and mortality .
these organisms have high rates of antibiotic resistance and are associated with worse outcomes .,"streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of communityacquired pneumonia , and immunosuppressed patients have increased risk of disseminated infection ."
"lung transplants have the highest incidence of invasive aspergillosis among solid organ transplant recipients , and it is the most common invasive fungal infection in lung transplant .",aspergillus is ubiquitous in the environment and is acquired by inhalation .
these infections may also be associated with development of chronic allograft dysfunction .,"community - acquired respiratory viruses , including influenza , are a major source of respiratory symptoms and mor - bidity after lung transplantation ."
bilateral lung recipients appear to have a better median survival compared to single - lung recipients ( 7 versus years ) .,overall lung transplantation confers clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in health - related quality of life ( hrqol ) .
"a typical medication regimen consists of three classes of immunosuppression drugs ( i . e . , calcineurin inhibitor , cell - cycle inhibitor , and corticosteroids ) , as well as opportunistic infection prophylaxis against pneumocystis jiroveci , other fungal infections , and cmv .","it includes management of immunosuppression regimen , opportunistic infection prophylaxis , prevention and management of various comorbidities , and complications ."
"typical clinic visits include thorough medication reconciliation , clinical exam , pulmonary function testing , chest radiographs , and laboratory examinations .","in early postoperative period and after hospital discharge , the recipients are closely monitored in outpatient setting ."
"lung transplant recipients have one of the shortest survival rates among other solid organ recipients , due to some unique characteristics of the lung allograft , including its unique blood supply and risk for ischemia , disruption of the native lymphatics and the neural supply during the transplant surgery , and eure to immunogenic entities via ventilation .","among noninfectious complications , pgd , vte , and rejection are the most important ones ."
"to meet this demand , the spanish society of infectious diseases and clinical microbiology has updated its standard procedure for the microbiological diagnosis of viral respiratory infection .",these facts are generating an increasing diagnostic demand that should be incorporated into the healthcare setting without delay .
"of the fcovs analysed , were found to have an intact b gene whereas eight showed deletions of either three or nucleotides .",the orf7b from the peritoneal / pleural effusions of fip cats and from the rectal swabs of healthy cats was amplified .
field fcov strains of fip cats analysed thus far all contain intact orf7b .,"e24 in order to gain a better understanding of the correlation between orf7b and the virulence of the virus , we investigated the orf7b of fcovs from clinical specimens from cats , half from wet - type fip animals and half from clinically healthy cats ."
"eleven microlitres of rna - containing sample was added to the premix , consisting of ml of first strand buffer , mmol dntp ( geneteks , bioscience , taipei ) , pmol primer p211 : - cacta - gatccagacgttagctc - 3 , mm dithiothreitol and , finally , ml containing unit moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase ( invitrogen , california ) , were added in a ml reaction tube .",total rna was extracted from ml of the body effusion or suspension of the rectal swab using trizol .
"multiple alignments of nucleic acid sequences were performed by the jotun hein method using the megalign program ( dnastar , madison , wi ) .",the cdna sequences of orf7b were then compared with other fcovs from around the world .
the age of the cats ranging from month to years ( mean 9 ae 6 ; n ) and no sex difference ( 10 animals for each se was observed ( table ) .,"another cats that showed a clinical history of anorexia , weight loss , lethargy , icterus , mild antibiotic - unresponsive fever , abdominal distension and / or thoracic effusion with a low albumin to globulin ratio were included in the second group ."
"the two deletions are both located near the terminus , covering positions e32 and e64 , respectively ; both are in - frame deletions resulting in loss of either one or four amino acids in the orf7 protein .","four isolates with the - nucleotide deletion originated from the same household , whereas remaining isolates had an unrelated origin ( fig a ) ."
"regardless of the clinical status of the cats , viruses originating from the same household were similar to one another ( ntu9r , ntu10r , ntu11r , ntu12r and ntu8p ; ntu27r , ntu28r , ntu29r and ntu26a ) .","of the eight fcovs with deletions , five originated from the rectal swabs of clinically healthy cats ( ntu13r , ntu14r , ntu15r , ntu16r and ntu25r ) , and three from the body effusions of fip cats ( ntu4p , ntu5a and ntu37a ) ( fig a ) ."
"in , herrewegh et al , first demonstrated the association between orf7b gene integrity and fcov virulence in a comparative sequence analysis .","the gene became the focus of attention , with studies of viruses from different geographical areas of the world ."
"the current understanding with respect to orf7b includes the following : ( i ) the gene can only be found in feline and canine , but not in porcine , coronaviruses , 29 ; ( ii ) the gene encodes a non - structural , soluble , secretory the phylogenetic trees were generated using the dnastar megalign program .","the scale beneath the tree measures the distance between sequences , and the units at the bottom of the tree indicates the number of substitution events ."
"it is designed to bridge the gaps between three areas of research e econometric general equilibrium modeling , international trade theory , and modern macroeconomics e by incorporating the best features of each .","g - cubed is a multi - country , multi - sector , intertemporal general equilibrium model that has been used to study a variety of policies in the areas of environmental regulation , tax reform , monetary and fiscal policy , and international trade ."
"following the armington approach ( armington , ) , goods produced in different regions are treated as imperfect substitutes .","unlike most trade models , however , g - cubed distinguishes between financial and physical capital ."
production is broken down into n industries and each is represented by an econometrically estimated cost function .,"drawing on the general equilibrium literature , g - cubed represents each region by its own multisector econometric general equilibrium model ."
"overall , the model is designed to provide a bridge between computable general equilibrium models , international trade models and macroeconomic models by combining key features of each approach .",the cost of this versatility is that g - cubed is a fairly large model .
"versions have been built with two sectors ( macroeconomic issues ) , six sectors ( trade and growth issues ) , sectors ( energy and environmental issues ) , sectors ( india ) and sectors ( australia ) .","there are several different versions of g - cubed that have been developed , depending on the question being analyzed ."
"this important distinction leads to a critical difference between the quantity of physical capital that is available at any time to produce goods and services , and the valuation of that capital as a result of decisions about the allocation of financial capital .","an important distinction is made between the stickiness of physical capital within sectors and within countries and the flexibility of financial capital , which quickly flows to where eected returns are highest ."
"this assumption , when taken together with the elicit modeling of money and other financial assets , gives the model more realistic macroeconomic properties than conventional general equilibrium models .",the model allows for short - run wage rigidity ( varying in degree across countries ) and therefore allows for significant periods of unemployment depending on the labor market institutions in each country .
the most frequently used model and the version most relevant for environmental and energy questions is the sector model .,in this paper we will focus on the structure and specification of this version of g - cubed .
to keep our notation as simple as possible we have not subscripted variables by country except where needed for clarity .,throughout the discussion all quantity variables will be normalized by the economy ' s endowment of effective labor units .
"we assume that each of the sectors can be represented by a price - taking firm , which chooses variable inputs and its level of investment in order to maximize its stock market value .",each firm ' s production technology is represented by a tier - structured constant elasticity of substitution ( ces ) function .
"where q i is the output of industry i , x ij is industry i ' s use of input j , and ij parameters reflect the weights of different inputs in production ; the superscript ' o ' indicates that the parameters apply to the top , or ' output ' , tier .","without loss of generality , we constrain the ds to sum to one ."
we represent these preferences by defining composite commodities that are produced from imported and domestic goods .,"each of these commodities , y i , is a ces function of inputs domestic output , q i , and imported goods , m i ."
"finally , the production function includes one additional feature to allow the model to be used to examine the effects of emissions quotas or tradable permit systems : each input is used in fixed proportions to the use of an input - specific permit .",the permits are owned by households and included in household wealth .
"to formalize this we adopt uzawa ' s approach by assuming that in order to install j units of capital a firm must buy a larger quantity , i , that depends on its rate of investment ( j / k ) :","following the cost of adjustment models of lucas , treadway and uzawa , we assume that the investment process is subject to rising marginal costs of installation ."
r ( s ) is the long - term interest rate between periods t and s:,( 15.5 ) where s is an investment tax credit and p ) is the producer price of the firm ' s output .
where l i is the shadow value of an additional unit of investment in industry i .,"equation ( 15.7 ) gives the firm ' s factor demands for labor , energy and materials , and equations ( 15.8 ) and ( 15.9 ) describe the optimal evolution of the capital stock ."
"this creates inertia in private investment , which improves the model ' s ability to mimic historical data and is consistent with the existence of firms that are unable to borrow .","the weight on unconstrained behavior , a , is taken to be based on a range of empirical estimates reported by mckibbin and sachs ."
within each region we assume household behavior can be modeled by a representative agent with an intertemporal utility function of the form :,"households have three distinct activities in the model : they supply labor , they save , and they consume goods and services ."
"the household maximizes ( 15.15 ) subject to the constraint that the present value of consumption ( potentially adjusted by risk premium m h ) be equal to the sum of human wealth , h , and initial financial assets , f :","where c ( s ) is the household ' s aggregate consumption of goods and services at time s , g ( s ) is government consumption at s , which we take to be a measure of public goods provided , and q is the rate of time preference ."
"as before , n appears in ( 15.16 ) because the model ' s scaled variables must be converted back to their original basis .",human wealth is defined as the eected present value of the future stream of aftertax labor income plus transfers : ( 15.17 ) this specification imposes the restriction that household decisions on the allocations of eenditure among different goods at different points in time be separable .
"where s is the tax rate on labor income , tr is the level of government transfers , l c is the quantity of labor used directly in final consumption , l i is labor used in producing the investment good , l g is government employment , and l i is employment in sector i .","financial wealth is the sum of real money balances , mon / p , real government bonds in the hand of the public , b , net holding of claims against foreign residents , a , the value of capital in each sector and holdings of emissions permits , q i p :"
"denoting the share of consumers who are not constrained e and choose consumption in accordance with ( 15.19 ) e by a , total consumption eenditure is given by :","however , based on the evidence cited by campbell and mankiw and hayashi we assume some consumers are liquidity - constrained and consume a fixed fraction g of their after - tax income ( inc ) ."
"once the level of overall consumption has been determined , spending is allocated among goods and services according to a two - tier ces utility function .","at the top tier , the demand equations for capital , labor , energy and materials can be shown to be :"
"the use of the ces function has the undesirable effect of imposing unitary income elasticities , a restriction usually rejected by data .",an alternative would be to replace this specification with one derived from the linear eenditure system .
"a global approach to energy and the environment : the g - cubed model where x ci is household demand for good i , s o c is the top - tier elasticity of substitution and the d ci are the input - specific parameters of the utility function .","the price index for consumption , p c , is given by :"
the demand equations and price indices for the energy and materials tiers are similar .,household capital services consist of the service flows of consumer durables plus residential housing .
p ck ak c p i i c e r s m z n s t ds ; ( 15.26 ) where p ck is the imputed rental price of household capital and m z is a risk premium on household capital ( possibly zero ) .,"this problem is nearly identical to the investment problem faced by firms , including the partial adjustment mechanism outlined in equations 3 and 4 , and the results are very similar ."
the government budget constraint may be written in terms of the accumulation of public debt as follows :,"in addition , there can be taxes on externalities such as carbon dioxide emissions ."
we assume that agents will not hold government bonds unless they eect the bonds to be paid off eventually and accordingly impose the following transversality condition : lim s / n b s e r s n s :,"where b is the stock of debt , d is the budget deficit , g is total government spending on goods and services , tr is transfer payments to households and t is total tax revenue net of any investment tax credit ."
this prevents per capita government debt from growing faster than the interest rate forever .,"if the government is fully leveraged at all times , ( 15.28 ) allows ( 15.27 ) to be integrated to give :"
these closures have interesting implications but are beyond the scope of this paper .,"other fiscal closure rules are possible , such as requiring the ratio of government debt to gdp to be unchanged in the long run or that the fiscal deficit be egenous with a lump sum tax ensuring this holds ."
these demands can be summarized in a set of bilateral trade matrices which give the flows of each good between erting and importing countries .,flows of goods are determined by the import demands described above .
"however , in cases where there are institutional rigidities to capital flows , the arbitrage condition does not hold and we replace it with an elicit model of the relevant restrictions ( such as capital controls ) .","where i k and i j are the interest rates in countries k and j , m k and m j are egenous risk premiums demanded by investors ( possibly zero ) , and e j k is the exchange rate between the currencies of the two countries ."
"within each economy , the eected returns to each type of asset are equated by arbitrage , taking into account the costs of adjusting physical capital stock and allowing for egenous risk premiums .","capital flows may take the form of portfolio investment or direct investment but we assume these are perfectly substitutable ex ante , adjusting to the eected rates of return across economies and across sectors ."
we assume that money enters the model via a constraint on transactions .,we use a money demand function in which the demand for real money balances is a function of the value of aggregate output and short - term nominal interest rates :
"where y is aggregate output , p is a price index for y , i is the interest rate , and is the interest elasticity of money demand .",following mckibbin and sachs we take to be e0 . 6 .
we started with the detailed benchmark us input - output transactions tables produced by the bureau of economic analysis ( bea ) and converted them to a standard set of industrial classifications and then aggregate them to sectors .,the procedure is described in detail in and can be summarized as follows .
in this case it is convenient to replace the production function with its dual unit cost function .,"to estimate the production side of the model , we began with the energy and materials tiers because they have constant returns to scale and all inputs are variable ."
"the output node must be treated differently because it includes capital , which is not variable in the short run .","we assume that the firm chooses output , q i , and its top - tier variable inputs ( l , e and m ) to maximize its restricted profit function , p :"
maximizing ( 15.36 ) with respect to variable inputs produces the following factor demand equations for industry i :,"where k i is the quantity of capital owned by the firm , d ik is the distributional parameter associated with capital , and j ranges over inputs other than capital ."
much of the empirical literature on cost and production functions fails to account for the fact that capital is fixed in the short run .,"rather than using ( 15.37 ) , a common approach is to use factor demands of the form :"
"in we show that using equation ( 15.38 ) biases the estimated elasticity of substitution toward unity for many sectors in the model in petroleum refining , for example , the fixed - capital estimate for the top tier elasticity , s o , is 4 while in the variable elasticity case it is 4 .",the treatment of capital thus has a very significant effect on the estimated elasticities of substitution .
"in effect , we are assuming that all regions share a similar but not identical production technology .","the share parameters ( the ds in the equations above ) , however , are derived from regional input - output data taken from the gtap version database and differ from one region to another ."
the trade elasticities are based on a survey of the literature and vary between and .,trade shares were obtained from un standard industry trade classification ( sitc ) data aggregated up from the four - digit level .
in order to do so we begin by making assumptions about the future course of key egenous variables .,we take the underlying long - run rate of world population growth plus productivity growth to be % per annum and take the long - run real interest rate to be %.
"this problem arises in all intertemporal models and is not unique to g - cubed , but it is inconvenient when interpreting the model ' s results .","in particular , it is unlikely that the costate variables based on current and eected future paths of the egenous variables in the model will equal the actual values of those variables in ."
"for example , the constants for tobin ' s q for each sector in each country are added to the arbitrage equation for each sector ' s q .","to address the problem we add a set of constants , one for each costate variable , to the model ' s costate equations ."
"it has been used by agencies within the governments of the us , japan , canada , australia and new zealand , as well as in reports by the intergovernmental panel on climate change , the un , the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) , the world bank , the international monetary fund , the asian development bank , and a number of corporations .","originally developed to evaluate climate change policies , g - cubed has been used to analyze trade policy , monetary and fiscal policy , financial crises , projections of global economic growth , the impacts of pandemics , and global demographic change ."
the second focus has been on evaluating the impacts of a variety of policy changes on these projections .,one has been on generating projections of the future evolution of the world economy and eloring the sensitivity of these projections to a variety of assumptions .
"in a study for the united nations university , bagnoli et al .","found that over a year horizon , assumptions about productivity growth and structural change are crucial for understanding an economy ' s energy intensity ."
"although overall gdp growth matters , sectoral - level differences in productivity are critical for future emissions .","the other issue that was emphasized in this study and related studies , is that the effect of small changes in low - level growth rates over or more years can have enormous effects on composition of the economy ."
"nonetheless , using the revenue to reduce taxes on capital can help to offset the negative effects of a carbon abatement policy in australia .","however , this effect does not occur in a country like australia because it is not a major participant in global capital markets and has very little impact on world interest rates ."
these papers show that changes in environmental policy are unlikely to lead to major changes in trade flows through relocation of industry because the costs of environmental policy are generally small relative to the cost of relocating production facilities .,"this does not mean that environmental policies lead to small losses in economic output , but that policies are unlikely to be fully offset by substitution toward goods that are not subject to the same environmental regulation ."
"however , g - cubed suggests that such an approach would put enormous stress on the world trade system depending on the tightness of the emission targets , the extent to which the allocation of permits was different from the permits required to meet the targets , and the marginal cost of abatement in different countries , amongst other things .","supporters of a global permit system regard this as an advantage , because it would allow developed countries to compensate developing countries for reducing their emissions ."
"although developing countries are generally less carbon intensive , they cannot absorb a large capital inflow because of the adjustment costs in physical capital formation .",a rise in the price of carbon leads to a fall in the return on capital in carbon - intensive economies and to capital outflow from carbon - intensive economies into large economies and less carbon - intensive economies .
"we found that the tariffs would be small on most traded goods , would reduce leakage of emissions reduction very modestly and would do little to protect import - competing industries .","we estimated how large such tariffs would be in practice , and then examined their economic and environmental effects ."
"this eerience led to the development of a ' hybrid ' policy of taxes and permit trading set out in mckibbin and wilcoxen ( 2 0 0 2 a , b , , .",a policy that is able to manage uncertainty is key in the climate policy debate .
"liberalization within the regional groupings that include australia ( world , apec and australia ) results in short - term losses as the tariff reductions are phased in .","countries were assumed to reduce tariff rates from levels to zero by for developed countries , and by for developing countries figure . 1 shows the impact on australian real gdp of liberalization in alternative groupings ."
"once the liberalization is announced , the return to capital in some sectors rises and capital flows in , appreciating the real exchange rate .",the adjustment path to phased liberalization can therefore exhibit short - run costs as resources begin to be reallocated before the trade reforms are implemented .
the appreciation of the real exchange rate and worsening of the trade balance is not a loss of underlying competitiveness because of a bad policy change .,"however , the capital inflows are needed to build future capacity in eanding sectors ."
in eloring the impact of nominal exchange rate realignment the results from g - cubed show that a revaluation of east asia ' s exchange rates by % ( effectively a shift in monetary policy ) cannot resolve the imbalances .,"they found the fundamental cause of trade imbalance since is changes in savingeinvestment gaps , attributed to the surge of the us fiscal deficits and the decline of east asia ' s private investment after the financial crisis ."
theoretical issues in monetary policy design are investigated using g - cubed in henderson and mckibbin ; .,"trade imbalances caused by macroeconomic policies and shocks are elored in lee , mckibbin and park ."
secondly a credible phasing in of fiscal cuts can reduce eected future tax liabilities of households and firms which dampens the negative direct effects of cuts in government spending .,"the reason is that the negative flow - on effects through trade linkages by high - income economies reducing imports and stimulating erts with the developing world are offset by favorable financial flow - on effects , which provides capital for developing countries to increase gdp ."
"in mckibbin and martin , the siector version of g - cubed was used to simulate the asian currency and economic crisis .","data from the key crisis economies of thailand , korea and indonesia were used as inputs for simulations to see if the model could generate the scales of adjustment in asset markets as well as the sharp declines in economic activity that occurred ."
"the reaction of policy makers directly , and in the implications for risk of their responses are crucial to the evolution of the crisis .",too often policy makers and modelers a global approach to energy and the environment : the g - cubed model ignore this interdependence .
the results for a risk shock are similar to the results for a fall in eected productivity .,the shock leads to capital outflow from crisis economies and a sharp real and nominal exchange - rate depreciation .
the model suggested that a country like australia would slow only slightly in the short run and the us would eerience stronger growth as a result of the capital reallocation .,"the model showed that although the international trade effects were negative for countries that ert to asia , the capital outflow from crisis economies would push down world interest rates and stimulate non - traded sectors of economies that were not affected by changes in risk assessment ."
"in a number of papers stoeckel ( 2 0 1 0 a , b ) used the approach of mckibbin and martin together with shock to us housing markets and policy responses of central banks and fiscal authorities around the world to model the global financial crisis of .","specifically they modeled the key aspects of the crisis as : ( i ) the bursting of the housing bubble and loss in asset prices and household wealth with consumers cutting back on spending and lifting savings ; ( ii ) a sharp reappraisal of risk with a spike in bond spreads on corporate loans and interbank lending rates with the cost of credit , including trade credit , rising with a commensurate collapse of stock markets around the world ; and ( iii ) a massive policy response including a monetary policy easing , bailouts of financial institutions and fiscal stimulus ."
the adverse trade effects from the us downturn would have been offset to some degree by positive effects from a global reallocation of capital .,"were the us alone affected by the crisis , chinese investment could have actually risen ."
a third combination was elored in mckibbin and stoeckel ( 2 0 1 0 b ) where agents uneectedly switch from one scenario of believing the shock to be permanent to one the temporary scenario several years later .,the dynamics for are quite different between the temporary scenario and the eectation revision scenario even though the shocks are identical from onwards .
traditional estimates based on loss of life and income foregone estimates underestimate the costs of large - scale change in economic behavior and the spillovers between economies of disease outbreaks .,"the authors estimated that the cost in of sars for the world economy as a whole was close to $40 billion , which is the official who estimate of the sars outbreak ."
"the scenarios were : ( i ) a ' mild ' pandemic , modeled on e1969 hong kong flu ; ( ii ) a ' moderate ' pandemic , modeled on the asian flu of ; ( iii ) a ' severe ' pandemic similar to the lower estimates of mortality and morbidity in the spanish flu of e1919 ; and ( v ) an ' ultra ' pandemic , modeled on high - end estimates of the spanish flu .","based on historical eerience of influenza pandemics , mckibbin and sidorenko considered four mortality scenarios under current economic linkages in the global economy ."
by following the blanchard approach and assuming a constant probability of death across cohorts we are able to aggregate agents outside the model and feed in the change in productivity by agent cohort using estimated age - earnings profiles to generate shocks to effective labor supply in the model .,this short cut approach of assuming a constant probability of death across cohorts is a strong assumption .
an analysis of the impact of the global and regional differences in demographic change needs to take into account the effects of changing growth rates as well as the numbers of adults and children .,"mckibbin ( 2 0 0 6 b ) incorporated these projections into a general equilibrium model that allows for the changing composition of the population , and captures its effect on labor supply , investment , growth potential , saving , asset markets , international trade and financial flows ."
there are at least two most important policy implications from this research .,"the first is that the projected demographic transition in the global economy will likely have important macroeconomic impacts on growth , trade flows , asset prices ( real interest rate and real exchange rates ) and investment rates ."
", which elored the impact of productivity improvements induced by economic reform and lowering barriers to international capital flows in developing countries .",a first attempt at this is contained in batini et al .
in this section we present results illustrating the use of g - cubed for analysis of financial shocks and international trade agreements .,the first analysis draws on mckibbin and stoeckel ( 2 0 1 0 b ) and examines the effects of a financial crisis on the global economy .
"in addition , the aggregate region representing europe has been replaced with a narrower aggregate representing the euro zone countries other than germany .","there are seven additional regions including five new countries ( canada , the uk , germany , india and new zealand ) and two new aggregates ( other asia and latin america ) ."
they play an important role in the model ' s calibration as well as having large impacts on economic outcomes through intertemporal relationships .,"for example , risk premia m k and m j appear in equation ( 15.30 ) , the arbitrage equation between returns on domestic and us bonds , which is repeated below :"
"in addition , as shown in equation there are risk premia , m ei , between bonds and equity in each sector within each economy , which represent the sector ' s equity risk premium .","there is also a risk premium , m h , on the rate at which households discount future after tax labor income , as shown in equation ( 15.16 ) ."
"in calibrating the model , these risk premia are calculated so that the model ' s solution values for forward looking variables in the base year are equal to the historical values of those variables .","for example , in the case of country risk ( m ) , a constant is chosen so that the current exchange rate , which is the eected future path of interest differentials plus the period t exchange rate , is equal to the actual exchange rate in the base period ."
once the risk premia are calculated they held constant for most simulations .,"however , they can be shocked to elore the impact of changes in perceived risks ."
"the first is a rise in country risk in europe ( consisting of the country models for germany , the rest of the euro zone and the uk ) .","to illustrate the importance of these risk premia , two eeriments are presented in this section ."
all risk premia are held constant at their calibrated values discussed above .,in the reference case the world economy is assume to grow along the model ' s baseline projections .
the immediate effect of the shock is a reduction in the financial value of european assets as investors reallocate their portfolios away from those assets .,financial capital flows out of europe causing a sharp fall in nominal and real european exchange rates .
"real investment , shown in figure . 5 also changes as eected : a sharp immediate drop in europe , followed by a gradual recovery as european capital stocks converge to their new , lower , long - term levels ; and the reverse in the us and china .","interest rates in the us and china , on the other hand , fall slightly ."
"overall , european regions eerience lower consumption and investment , and higher net erts .","on balance , the effect on european gdp is negative , as shown in figure . 7 ."
"although the value of capital drops sharply in europe ( as reflected in the real exchange rate shown in figure . 2 ) , it rises in the us and china .","roughly speaking , the shock tends to reallocate financial capital rather than destroy it ."
"finally , the results for china in the second simulation show the importance of assumptions about monetary policy .","this result illustrates one of the benefits of intertemporal general equilibrium models that elicitly model the supply side of economies : in more traditional keynesian macroeconomic models , this effect does not exist and demands driven by trade dominate the results for the international transmission of economic shocks ."
"in particular , we evaluated the ftaa under two different assumptions about its effect on productivity growth and under alternative assumptions about how governments respond to a decline in tariff revenue .",in mckibbin and wilcoxen we considered a range of competing assumptions about the manner in which the ftaa would be implemented and the effects it would have on individual economies .
"by this standard , trade liberalization is usually found to improve welfare other papers in the literature on trade and the environment include strutt and anderson , who find that trade","traditionally , general equilibrium studies of trade reform have focused on measuring these efficiency gains , and measuring them at a given point in time , usually either the immediate short run after the reform has been implemented , or far in the future at the model ' s long run equilibrium ."
"can improve environmental quality in some circumstances and does little harm otherwise , and tsigas et al .",", who find that the effect of trade on the environment is ambiguous ."
"moreover , these studies find that trade liberalization has much larger effects than traditional static analysis suggests : frankel and romer , for example , find that a one percentage point increase in the ratio of trade to gdp raises per capita income by e3 % .","in addition to changing capital accumulation , the empirical literature suggests that trade improves industry productivity by placing additional competitive pressure on previously protected industries , and by increasing the flow of investment and embodied technical change across borders ( frankel and romer , ; chand , ) ."
the first employs the traditional assumption that firms in liberalizing economies do nothing when faced by increased competition from imports ( apart from substituting toward cheaper inputs ) : they do not cut costs or adopt better management practices or newer technology .,"as a result , we approach the issue by running two sets of simulations ."
"this can lead to pronounced increases in capital inflows , particularly for developing countries .","finally , a third indirect effect of trade agreements is that increased openness lowers the risk premium attached to a country ' s sovereign debt by rating agencies such as standard and poor ' s and moody ' s ( stoeckel et al . , ) ."
"in addition , it accounts for the relative immobility of physical capital and the high mobility of financial capital .","g - cubed ' s basic design is well - suited to the task because it has a full , integrated treatment of international trade and financial flows : each country ' s current account position must be offset by its capital account , which in turn leads to accumulation or erosion of its stock of foreign assets and thus to changes in its future flow of interest payments ."
"within each region , the disaggregation of production remained the same : the sectors shown in table . 2 .",the full list of regions is shown in table . 5 .
"for free trade agreements such as nafta or the ftaa , the tariffs on trade within the preferential area are set to zero .",it should be noted that the model does not require participants in a free trade agreement have harmonized external tariffs : each country retains its original tariffs on trade outside the free trade area unless otherwise specified in a simulation .
in this chapter we focus only on the simulations that include productivity effects ; full results including the other simulations can be found in mckibbin and wilcoxen .,the simulations discussed in here are listed in table . 6 .
the pattern of trade under the reference case is exemplified by the figures shown in table . 8 for year of the simulation ; refer to table . 5 for a list of region codes .,"each panel of the table gives the bilateral trade matrix for a particular good ; panel nine , for example , shows trade in durable goods ."
"aircraft , for example , are an important component of durables erted by the us but are not a significant portion of us imports of durables from japan .","the row sums in table . 8 show the total value of imports of the good by each region ; the sum of the ' u ' row in panel , for example , shows that total us imports of crude oil from all of its trading partners were worth $96.2 billion ."
"six sectors each account for less than $100 billion : electricity ( $5 billion ) , natural gas delivered by utilities ( $12 billion ) , refined petroleum products ( $86 billion ) , coal ( $22 billion ) , non - fuel mining ( $48 billion ) and forestry ( $80 billion ) .","at the opposite extreme , two sectors each account for more than a trillion dollars : durables ( $2926 billion ) and non - durables ( $1365 billion ) ."
"in order to evaluate subsequent simulations , it is useful to group the model ' s regions into three aggregates : ( i ) the nafta countries : the us , canada , mexico ; ( ii ) the other table . 9 shows the dollar value of trade flows within and between each of these aggregates .","as in the detailed bilateral trade matrices , the column indicates the source of each trade flow and the row indicates its destination ."
lower trade barriers on durables would also allow a freer flow of new technology and embodied technical change .,industries previously protected by high tariffs and now faced with increased competition would almost certainly undertake cost - cutting measures and shift toward global best practices in production .
"for example , the canadian tariff on durables is initially 4% so under this assumption trade reform would lead to a 7% improvement in the productivity of the canadian durables sector .","in contrast , the mexican tariff on durables is initially % so the corresponding industry ' s productivity improvement would be limited to %."
"as would be eected , the reduction in tariffs leads to an increase in trade among nafta countries .",entries with changes greater than or equal to % in magnitude are given in italics and those with changes less than % in magnitude are left blank .
the effects of nafta - p on trade and selected macroeconomic variables are shown in figure . 10 .,"the reduction in tariffs in canada and mexico causes the demand for imports in those regions to increase , leading to depreciation of the two exchange rates relative to the us dollar ."
either policy could reduce or eliminate the macroeconomic effects caused by the increase in the fiscal deficit .,"in addition , monetary policy could be altered e in these simulations the money supply has been held constant at its base case value ."
a decline in the exchange rate is a reduction in the number of dollars per unit of foreign currency and hence a depreciation of the currency .,"in g - cubed , exchange rates are defined as the number of us dollars per unit of foreign currency ."
the most notable result is a pronounced decline in imports of durables from non -,the value of trade flows between aggregate regions is shown in table . 12 above .
a global approach to energy and the environment : the g - cubed model during the period of anticipation and then rebound after implementation .,"by year , output levels , erts and capital stocks become similar to those from the unanticipated ftaa , as can be seen in table . 14 ."
"in keeping with the modest effects of nafta and the ftaa on industry output and gdp , the effect on carbon emissions is relatively small ; in most cases , the change is e2 % of emissions in the reference case .","finally , figure . 14 shows the effect of each of the simulations on total carbon dioxide emissions from key regions ."
"the overall effects of the ftaa are highly analogous to nafta , but smaller in magnitude .","countries reducing their tariffs see imports rise , exchange rates fall , trade balances move toward deficit , capital inflows increase and foreign debt levels rise ."
this effect is particularly noticeable with durables imported by brazil and the rest of latin america .,"in addition , productivity effects tend to reduce the changes in trade flows caused by liberalization because the difference in relative prices between foreign and domestic goods is smaller ."
"investment , saving and international asset markets are driven by agents solving intertemporal optimization problems and having eectations driven by foresight ( although not always perfect foresight ) .","it distinguishes between financial and physical capital , tracking financial capital by currency and physical capital by region and sector where it is installed ."
"its industry detail allows it to be used to examine environmental and tax policies , which tend to have their largest direct effects on small segments of the economy .",intertemporal modeling of investment and saving allows it to trace out the transition of the economy between the short run and the long run .
it has also occasionally been used as a forecasting model although it was not designed for that purpose .,"its core strengths are : ( i ) scenario analysis , where scenarios are made up of different shocks that might confront the world economy or an individual country , and ( ii ) policy evaluation , especially where dynamic adjustment towards a long - run equilibrium is important ."
the article by shieh et al on the pathology and pathogenesis of the pandemic h1n1 influenza a virus is a landmark work in the long evolution of our understanding of this ever - threatening public health challenge .,"during the intervals between the pandemics of , , , , and , most of the public , including physicians , did not distinguish between colds and the flu ."
the concordance of influenza viral antigen with diffuse alveolar damage and infection of type ii pneumocytes is critical to understanding the pathogenesis of the pandemic disease .,", the h1n1 influenza virus infected not only the tracheobronchial epithelium but also the submucosal glands and alveolar lining cells , particularly type ii pneumocytes , which were distinguished from alveolar macrophages and type i pneumocytes by antisurfactant ihc , as sloughed alveolar cells are not easily identified by morphology alone and could be mistaken on a purely morphological basis as alveolar macrophages ."
this series of cases adds significantly to the information in two other particularly excellent h1n1 in - fluenza autopsy series .,"a series of cases largely from the new york city medical examiner ' s office provided correlations with computerized tomographic pulmonary lesions but in contrast had a higher rate of secondary bronchopneumonia ( 55% versus %) , less infection of alveolar type i and ii pneumocytes , and less apparent colocalization of diffuse alveolar damage and viral antigen ."
yet other gaps in knowledge could be closed if pathologists were organized to do a greater number of well - organized autopsy studies .,"the centers for disease control pathology branch has used the material in their hands yet again to contribute to knowledge of pathogenesis as well as pathology as they have done many times previously , such as with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome , the anthrax attacks , and coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome ."
"after the isolation of influenza a virus from swine by robert shope in and from humans by andrewes , laidlaw , and smith in , hers and mulder were prepared in to identify by immunofluorescence staining that tracheobronchial ciliated epithelial cells and alveolar lining cells are the infected targets .","however , he considered that failure to reproduce influenza in human studies involving inoculation with pure cultures of h . influenzae was "" strong argument against it being the cause of influenza . """
"zoonotic infections remain an ever - growing unsolved puzzle , serving typically as an umbrella term under which numerous infectious diseases are shelved , in order to ignore not only their medical and veterinarian - related burden , but also , and more importantly , their major socioeconomic correlations , which pertain to global and regional political ethics , and thus should preferably remain unnoticed .","in medicine , this anthropocentric model of thinking is nowhere more obvious than in the case of zoonotic infections , the burden and significance of which are constantly under - appraised ."
"a definite clarification of the term though does not exist , and one may wonder whether we need one , apart from the broad characterization offered above .","in broad terms , a zoonotic infection is one that can be transmitted by animals to humans ."
"the term ' amphixenoses ' ( the greek words ' alu ' , which means bi - , and ' n mov ' , which means host ) was also limitedly used to describe zoonotic infections that are transmissible either way .","zoonoses were further characterized as anthropozoonoses , when transmitted from animals to humans , and zooanthroponoses when transmitted vice versa ."
"on the other hand , the novel swine influenza a ( h1n1 ) virus is also typically a zoonotic infection , transmitted from swine hosts to humans ; however , the ensuing direct human to human transmission was the signifying characteristic of the pathogen and the major factor leading to the pandemic .","despite being strictly a zoonotic infection , sharing initially certain socio - political characteristics with other typical zoonotic viral infections regarding its birth and initial contact with humans , its spread dynamics and human morbidity potential are irrelevant to its zoonotic nature ."
"moreover , a number of pathogens require a vertebrate host but can replicate in and infect humans through contact with abiotic material : often referred to as ' saprozoonoses ' , these agents are not unanimously considered to be of a zoonotic nature .","categorization is further blurred when considering agents usually transmitted from human to human through an arthropod vector ( for example dengue ) , agents though that require for their lifecycle an invertebrate animal host : these are not strictly zoonoses , because the animal host is invertebrate , but they do share certain socio - ecological characteristics with the typical zoonotic infections ."
"furthermore , one may wonder why we discuss zoonoses ; there are numerous reasons , ranging from those that are historical and philosophical / teleological to pure pragmatism .",one may wonder why a categorization is needed in the first place .
"hippocrates , among others , has written extensively about this interaction , and the common effect of infectious agents in livestock and humans can be traced as far back as the ten plagues of egypt .","' it will become fine dust over the whole land of egypt , and festering boils will break out on men and animals throughout the land ' , says eus , describing an airborne infection causing disease in livestock and humans ."
"although the categorization as zoonotic for some of the pathogens by taylor and colleagues may be doubtful ( many being theoretically only zoonotic ) , and although some of the species implicated are of historical or isolated significance for human health , there still exists an enormous burden of zoonotic agents causing major human morbidity .","furthermore , they managed to demonstrate that the vast majority of emerging diseases are caused by a zoonotic pathogen , the percentage reaching %."
voluntary or war - related immigration further serves as a vehicle for zoonotic infection migration : this has been demonstrated repeatedly regarding brucellosis kinetics .,"outbreaks of zoonotic infections in travellers abroad have been increasingly reported , ranging from leptospirosis in adventurous athletes , to leishmaniasis and q fever in troops deployed in iraq and afghanistan ."
"the fact that zoonotic control is a political issue though is a rather easy conclusion : the instructive story of a bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) outbreak and its enormous consequences for the economy not only of the affected country but also of numerous others , underlines how a peculiar and vaguely understood zoonotic agent can affect global politics .","again using brucellosis as an obvious example for the author ( an eerience though that could be generalized for numerous other zoonotic agents and various countries , industrialized or not , the us - mexico border being a prime example ) , a minor outbreak ( < 10 cases ) of foodborne brucellosis in a suburb of the capital , athens , a few years ago , resulted in extensive media coverage ; on the other hand , a rather extensive ( more than cases ) subsequent outbreak in a rural island of northern greece went unnoticed by the media , despite exhibiting significant evidence of all sorts of policy misdemeanours ( illegal animal importation , inadequate implication of preventive policies and subsequent testing , inadequate notification of preceding cases that should serve as an alarm , and so on ) ."
"in this vein , introducing novel control strategies and campaigns that may directly affect the economical status of livestock owners may result in opposition or unwillingness to co - operate by the public , thus cancelling any control effort at the beginning .","even if all these parameters are harmonized , one needs to be assured that the public will be receptive : a direct relationship of zoonotic disease prevalence with the health literacy of the public has been demonstrated for certain zoonoses , including brucellosis and rabies ."
"a non - anthropocentric view would thus consider man a true virus of nature , one that the universe tries to eliminate using all sorts of weapons , zoonotic bacteria being its antibodies , and zoonotic viruses its natural killer cells .","essentially it ' s the human that invades and disrupts nature ' s equilibrium , and naturally nature fights back ."
") , including the major infectious threats of the st century , sars - cov , avian influenza , the pandemic influenza , and the west nile virus us outbreak .",it is therefore not surprising that the vast majority of infectious disease outbreaks reported in recent decades have been of zoonotic nature or at least of zoonotic origin ( fig .
"it is foremost a concept of understanding nature as an organic system within which humans serve as a non - integral part , as a part of a chain that can recycle its integrity by eelling humans .","understanding the complexity of zoonotic infections , and tracing the aetiology of their resurgence back to their roots is far from the concept of surveillance / diagnosis / eradication and elimination campaigns ."
accuracy and precision were within the criteria requested by the ec requirements throughout this concentration range .,"linear behaviour was observed in the - 2500 ng ml range , which is relevant for real sample analysis ."
infection of cats with feline coronavirus ( fcov ) can have two different outcomes .,"cats infected with avirulent fcov - strains usually develop mild enteritis , while virulent fcov - strains can cause progressive and usually fatal vasculitis known as feline infectious peritonitis ( fip ) ."
these immune - evasion mechanisms could elain why fipv infected cells are not eliminated despite high antibody titres found in most infected cats .,the internalization pathway was fully characterized and was found to be dependent on ( among others ) myosin light chain kinase ( mlck ) .
"although ml - 7 has never been used in vivo as an antiviral compound , it has been administered to rats and mice to preserve lung or intestinal epithelial barriers during stress - or lipopolysaccharideinduced injury .",mlck is a possible target for drugs intended for relieve of lung or bowel injury during sepsis because it controls paracellular permeability .
"for this purpose , a reliable and sensitive analysis method of the drug in plasma must be available .","the development , and subsequent validation , of such a method for the determination of ml - 7 in feline plasma is presented and discussed in this paper ."
"methanol and water - used in sample clean - up - were of hplc grade ( vwr , leuven , belgium ) .","the additive to the mobile phase , formic acid , was of lc - ms grade ( biosolve ) ."
"the dry residue was redissolved in l of a methanol / water ( 1 / 1 , v / v ) mixture , vortexed for s and transferred over a 0 m nylon filter ( millipore , billerica , ma , usa ) into an autosampler vial , and a l aliquot was injected onto the uplc column .","the eluate was evaporated to dryness at c , under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas ."
"during the rest of the lc run , when ml - 7 and ml - 9 were eluted from the column , the uplc effluent was sent to the detector .","the instrument was calibrated with a solution of mg ml of nai , according to manufacturers ' instructions ."
"a solution of g ml of ml - 7 and ml - 9 was therefore infused in the hesi source at l min , using the following tune parameters : spray voltage , kv ; capillary voltage , v ; tube lens voltage , v ; skimmer voltage , v ; capillary temperature , c ; sheath gas , ( arbitrary units ) ; auxiliary gas , ( arbitrary units ) ; spare gas , ( arbitrary units ) .","fragmentation was obtained by a combination of in - source cid at a collision energy ev , and fragmentation in the hcd ( higher energy collisional dissociation ) collision cell at a collision energy of ev ."
"- accuracy and precision ( rsd ) : evaluated "" within - day "" at levels , and ng ml ( each n = ) , the limits for accuracy are to + 10% for levels ng ml , to + 10% for levels > 1 ng ml and < 10 ng ml , and to + 20% for levels ng ml , while the tolerances for precision are given by the horwitz equation : rsd max = , and for the , and ng ml levels respectively .","the curve was fitted with a linear curve with equation y = ax + b with weighing /x ( where y = instrument response and x = analyte concentration ) ; for good linearity the correlation coefficient r must be 9 and the goodness - of - fit coefficient g must be % for levels ng ml , and % for levels < ng ml ."
"this instrument allows high mass accuracy measurements of the fragment ions , which can then be related to the theoretical masses of the fragments generated by the mass frontier software .","mass errors m / m , with m the mass difference between the measured mass and the theoretical mass , and m the theoretical mass ) of 0 , 7 and 5 ppm were obtained for the fragment ions at m / z 7 , 3 and 0 respectively , of ml - 7 and ml - 9 ."
a point of concern - independent of the preceding extraction and clean - up procedure - seemed to be the filter device used at the end of the extraction procedure to allow the extracts to be injected onto an uplc system .,"it was shown that ml - 7 , as well as ml - 9 ( results not shown ) , were retained by several filter membrane types ( see table ) ."
"after vortex mixing for s , the sample was centrifuged ( 13,000 rpm , min ) .",the supernatant was transferred over a nylon filter device and a l aliquot was injected onto the lc column .
the sample was then rolled for min on a roll bank .,"a third extraction procedure evaluated was a liquid - liquid extraction with ethyl acetate : briefly , to a l plasma sampleconditioned or not with either l hcl m solution or l m naoh solution ml of ethyl acetate were added ."
"as eected , the best result was obtained here when the plasma sample was conditioned with l naoh m solution .","the ngroups of ml - 7 , and ml - 9 , are then deprotonated , favourizing the transfer to the organic phase ."
"no improvement was observed when ethyl acetate was replaced by dichloromethane as the extraction solvent : apparent recoveries of , , and % were obtained , respectively for non - conditioned , alkalinized and acidified plasma .","the fact that apparent recovery in acidic conditions is higher that in alkaline conditions might indicate that matrix effect is even more pronounced when using dichloromethane as extraction solvent , compared to ethyl acetate ."
"a procedure using an oasis hlb ( 30 mg , ml ) extraction cartridge was tested where a plasma sample was first treated with l % ( v / v ) ammonia solution , and thereafter loaded onto the cartridge conditioned successively with ml meoh , ml h o and ml % ( v / v ) ammonia solution .",a fourth extraction procedure involved the use of a solid - phase extraction clean - up step .
"a much more promising result was obtained when using an mcx instead of an hlb cartridge , as described in section .","the different steps of the extraction procedure were evaluated to obtain an extract combining a high recovery with a sufficient clean - up , allowing analysis by uplc - ms / ms and minimizing possible matrix effects on the analytes response , as observed for the liquid - liquid extraction procedure ."
"however , recovery was only marginal ( %) for both components , despite the fact that a cleaner solution was applied onto the cartridge .","the replacement of the l m hcl solution by l of a tca % ( w / v ) solution , added to the plasma before the ultracentrifugation step preceding the loading of the sample onto the mcx cartridge , resulted in a cleaner extract , since the tca solution is more powerful to remove plasma proteins ."
"a supplementary third wash step with an organic solvent such as methanol , adding a supplementary selectivity for washing additional to the aqueous phases , also resulted in an important loss of analyte , and was therefore not included in the final procedure .","surprisingly , for some unknown reason , the same washing procedure in the opposite order resulted in an important loss of both components ."
"since recovery decreases with increasing ammonia concentration in the elution solvent ( see table ) , the lowest concentration of ammonia ( 5% ) was retained in the final extraction method .","ammonia was added to the elution solvent methanol to disrupt the binding of ml - 7 and ml - 9 by deprotonating their n - groups , facilitating the recovery of both components ."
"the equivalent of the mcx cartridge of isolute ( biotage , uppsala , sweden ) , the scx column ( 500 mg , ml ) , was also evaluated as an alternative extraction cartridge .","although recoveries seemed to be quite comparable , a problem occurred when injecting the extracts onto the uplc column , namely excessive peak broadening and shift in retention time ."
the same was true in the higher range with ml - 7 levels ranging from to ng ml .,"as can be seen , the ml - 7 signal measured in mrm mode on the ms instrument was linear over a wide range from to ng ml , with r 9 and g %, as required for good linearity in this range ."
"lod was calculated to be 8 ng ml , by determining the average s / n of the six ng ml samples used for accuracy and precision evaluation , and using the s / n = criterion .","loq was established at ng ml , as the lowest level at which the criteria for accuracy and precision could be fulfilled ."
"more important however is that the method is free of any significant matrix effect , as well for ml - 7 as for ml - 9 , as shown by comparing the area of blank samples spiked after extraction and the area of a standard solution containing the same amount ( see fig .","for chromatograms typically obtained for such samples ) , and this for all blanks tested , despite their different composition and behaviour during extraction ( see section ) ."
"only for bovine plasma , extraction recovery was significantly lower , close to %.",these recoveries are comparable to the ones found for feline plasma ( see table ) .
"the matrix effect is very acceptable for the plasma of all different animal species tested , as well as for human plasma , with the least - positive results being a % increase of the ml - 7 signal in the case of chicken plasma , and a % decrease of the ml - 9 signal in the case of rabbit plasma .",a minor modification of the pre - spe step might be considered for bovine plasma to increase this lower extraction recovery .
"however , the method remains rather simple and not very time consuming , allowing the analysis of a sufficient number of samples in a reasonable time period .","validation of the method showed its good performance characteristics , possibly also for plasma of other animal species and human plasma ."
this study provides a methodology for investigating the necessary ventilation rate from an engineering viewpoint .,"dilution at lower volumes , specifically times , is insufficient for protecting non - infected people from sars eure and the risk of infection is very high ."
"following the first report of infection in guangdong province , china , in the spring of , more than people around the world , of whom lived in mainland china , were diagnosed with sars ( who ) .","among these infectious diseases , sars is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus ( sars - cov ) ( rota et al . , ) ."
"thus , it is important to understand the circumstances under which airborne transmission of sars may be possible and , more specifically , what ventilation rate is required to sufficiently dilute virus - laden air and reduce the risk of airborne viral transmission indoors .",the latter question can inform the design of ventilation systems that prevent indoor airborne transmission of sars and other similar infectious diseases .
"this suggests a possible threshold sars infectious concentration ( or , dilution ) such that , when the airborne viral concentration is lower than the threshold the possibility of infection is very low .","while a high ventilation rate could not reduce the total viral load emitted from sars patients , the subsequent dilution effect appears to have lowered the airborne viral concentration ."
"an infinite ventilation rate would theoretically be sufficient , but is not a practical solution given the high energy requirements .","the threshold for sars infectious concentration is unknown ; however , the actual ventilation system design requires a reasonable ventilation rate to ensure sufficient air dilution for preventing airborne infection of the virus ."
"from a fluid dynamics standpoint , virus - laden particles with sufficiently small inertia can be treated as passive species without the possibility of slippage to air ( murakami et al .","further , the size of fine particles is much smaller than the kolmogorov length scale for turbulence , meeting the criterion for the particles to be treated as a continuous phase ( batchelor ; lumley ) ."
a potential way is to use the air emitted from a sars patient as the reference indicator .,there is currently no accepted method for quantifying the number of sars virus particles or concentration of sars in the air .
we used the cfd method to simulate outdoor airflow around hospital buildings and to estimate the pressure drop coefficient for further study with a multi - zone model for simulating indoor airflow and the sars virus concentration distribution .,"for non - infection case ( the courtyard of hospital r in beijing ) , the cfd method is also adopted to simulate contaminant distribution ."
"the airflow around buildings is treated as incompressible , isothermal and turbulent .","thus , the time - averaged governing equations for airflow can be formulated as follows when adopting the widely - used k - turbulence model :"
the above equations can be discretized into algebraic equations using the finite volume method ( fvm ) and solved based on the semi - implicit method for pressure linked equations ( simple ) algorithm to couple velocity and pressure .,and s can be found in the cfd literature ( phoenics ) .
the inflow boundary condition is set to the gradient wind based on local weather data .,the outflow boundary condition is set as the free outflow boundary condition by ensuring that the computing domain is sufficiently large .
"by treating each room in the building as a single "" zone "" , the airflow rate from zone j to zone i , f j , i , can be calculated by","the multi - zone model is a relatively simple yet effective method for analyzing the airflow and concentration distribution inside buildings , especially for time - dependent analysis ."
"where f is the coefficient for the calculating airflow rate , and p j p i is the pressure drop along the flow path .","thus , the contaminant concentration in zone i , can be calculated by the mass conversion :"
rooms a and b are offices with four orthopedic physicians working in each room .,figure is the drawing of the corridor and adjacent rooms .
the dominant wind direction during this period was north and the average wind speed was m / s .,these data provide the necessary boundary conditions for reproducing the scenario .
it therefore appears to be the case that the sars virus spread through the hospital due to insufficient dilution of exhaled air from sars patients .,"that , although the air exhausted from patients had been diluted to times ( 1000 ppm to ppm ) , the possibility of infecting other people eed to that air was still very high ."
a tracer gas was injected into the exhaust duct before the fan ( fig .,"before conducting this simulation , on - site measurements were carried out for validation of the simulation model ."
"after removing the % of windows with the highest virus consistence air at the surfaces , we used the next highest virus consistence as the reference value to represent the equivalent sars virus consistence at that outside wind state .",this means the equivalent consistence in at least % of rooms facing the courtyard was higher than the reference value .
a multi - zone model was used to simulate the ventilation rate and direction under different wind speeds and directions ( fig .,"to reproduce this case , the measured wind speed and direction data between february and april , were obtained from the local metrological office and applied as the simulation boundary conditions ( table ) ."
"in contrast , a dilution rate is higher than times results in a low risk of infection risk .","more research is needed , however , to better understand what happens when the dilution rate falls between and times ."
"in well equipped hospitals , the etiological examination should be performed immediately ; while in poorly equipped hospitals , the specimen should be sent to entrusted institutions for etiological examination .","before anti - viral therapy is prescribed , it is necessary to collect the respiratory secretions for examination , such as nasopharyngeal secretions , oral gargle , tracheal aspirates or respiratory epithelial cells ."
"since the fi rst case was reported in yangzi river delta of china in feb . , the total cases with defi nitive diagnosis had been up to cases , including cases of death , by dec . , , with a mortality rate of roughly %.",human infected h7n9 avian infl uenza is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by subtype h7n9 of avian infl uenza virus .

"given the many factors that impact on policy changes in the vaccine and immunization enterprise , we encountered challenges associated with demonstrating attribution of specific policy changes to nvac recommendations .","the development of new and improved vaccines continues to represent a significant priority for nvac , and we identified several challenges related to future vaccine innovation ."

the legislation thus recognized the societal benefits of vaccination and the societal obligation to compensate individuals who suffered serious injuries caused by vaccination .,"in addition , the national childhood vaccine injury act ( public law - 660 ) created additional infrastructure to support immunization in the u . s . by establishing the vaccine injury compensation program ( vicp ) and required reporting of vaccine adverse events , which led to the development of the vaccine adverse event reporting system ( vaers ) and the establishment of the advisory commission on childhood vaccines ( accv ) ."

"notably , following the release of an iom report on ' ' financing vaccines in the st century : assuring access and availability "" , which recommended replacing the public immunization financing system with an insurance mandate and systems of subsidies and vouchers , nvac examined these recommendations and conducted a series of activities leading to a meeting with stakeholders in june .","nvac has repeatedly considered the topics of standards for immunization practices covering specific populations from infants to adults , the development and use of community and state - based immunization registries or immunization information systems ( iiss ) , and vaccine and vaccination financing to remove financial barriers to the receipt of vaccines ."
"one of the key parts of the recommendations in this report included asking cdc to report to nvac each year its ' ' professional judgment "" of the resources needed for the immunization program .","while the recommendation apparently led to one follow up discussion , the annual reporting recommended by nvac ' s report does not occur ."
"also , in september , nvac recommended that the ash seek to improve vaccination coverage of adolescents against hepatitis b virus infection , particularly when designing and implementing strategies to eliminate racial / ethnic disparities , and in may nvac endorsed maintaining existing recommendations for hepatitis b vaccine .","although it subsequently generally deferred to the acip on the recommendation of specific vaccines , in september nvac approved a resolution to encourage the acip to include hepatitis a in the vfc program ."
"in january , following a series of shortages of supply of recommended pediatric vaccines , nvac reviewed the reasons for the shortages and made recommendations to strengthen the u . s . vaccine supply , which included eanding the pediatric vaccine stockpile and increasing financial support for vaccine development .","in the context of vaccine utilization and supply concerns for influenza vaccine , in december nvac approved a report that included the following recommendations to strengthen the national influenza vaccination system : ( i ) ' ' improve vaccination coverage among recommended groups by facilitating the delivery of influenza vaccines in a range of settings , especially in ' medical homes , ' other medical sites , workplaces , and community sites where people have not previously had access to vaccination , "" ( ii ) ' ' make influenza vaccine purchase less of a burden and financial risk for providers , "" ( iii ) ' ' elore options for supporting a comprehensive vaccination program for adults , "" ( iv ) ' ' increase the rate of annual influenza vaccination among healthcare workers , "" ( v ) ' ' develop a working group to consider critical issues and barriers to eanded influenza vaccination recommendations and to pro - pose solutions , "" ( vi ) ' ' implement systems to better understand the burden of influenza illness in the united states and to better assess program impacts and vaccine effectiveness , "" and ( vii ) ' ' conduct a comprehensive review of the influenza research program to identify gaps and areas for additional support "" ."
"this effort led to a continued focus on influenza , which included a june report that evaluated the first year of the universal seasonal influenza vaccination recommendation and a february report on strategies to achieve the healthy people annual influenza vaccine coverage goal for health - care personnel .","in september , nvac approved a report that highlighted the importance of enhancing hhs national vaccine program efforts in global immunizations to increase global vaccine utilization and supply ."
"in september , nvac approved a report that sought to assure the vaccination of children and adolescents without financial barriers , with the recommendations related to financing vaccine purchase and vaccine administration in the public and private sectors published in .","following public debate about financing vaccines in the st century , nvac recommended creating eanded and stable funding for vaccines under the vaccines for children program , harmonization of regulatory requirements to encourage vaccine development and licensure , insurance coverage with no deductible for immunization , and adequate reimbursement for providers who administer vaccines ."
"with respect to adult immunization , in july nvac approved an adult immunization plan that used the healthy people : national health promotion and disease prevention objectives adult immunization goals as performance measures for the successful implementation of the plan .","in december , nvac hosted a workshop on adult immunization programs in nontraditional settings , including the now - common practice of delivering influenza vaccines to adults in pharmacies , and in , nvac emphasized the need to improve vaccine coverage for adults ."
"the report provided numerous recommendations to meet the objectives of ensuring : ( i ) ' ' appropriate protections of privacy and confidentiality for individuals and security for informa - tion included in the registry , "" ( ii ) ' ' participation of all immunization providers and recipients , "" ( iii ) ' ' appropriate technical and operational functioning of registries , "" and ( iv ) ' ' sustainable funding for registries "" .","in , nvac launched an initiative on immunization registries that led to an approved nvac report in january on the development of community - and state - based immunization registries ."
"in september , nvac recommended that the national center for quality assurance ( ncqa ) incorporate a healthcare effectiveness data and information set ( hedis ) measure for hpv vaccine for adolescent girls .","nvac referred to the healthy people goals as key indicators for tracking immunization system performance in many of its published reports [ 26 , , , , , , ] ."
in may nvac resolved to form a working group on pandemic influenza preparedness .,"in , nvac recognized the important role of two large multinational companies selling vaccines in the u . s . ( smithkline beecham [ now gsk ] and pasteur merieux connaught [ now sanofi pasteur ] ) and noted the locations of their headquarters outside of the u . s . underscored the interconnectedness of u . s . immunizations and those in the rest of the world ."
nvac ' s review of the progress on the national vaccine plan strongly supported the u . s . commitment to global immunization efforts and acknowledged that strengthening immunization systems throughout the world will improve access to safe and effective vaccines and ultimately protect the u . s . population from travel - related eure and importation of vaccine preventable diseases .,"finally , the nvac report recognizing the role of vaccines to combat antibiotic - resistant bacteria emphasized the importance of antibiotic resistant pathogens as a global issue ."
"while nvpo supports the work of nvac and plays a key role in ensuring optimal coordination and synergy across the u . s . immunization system , nvac does not independently play any role in coordination of stakeholders .","this review documents significant productivity of nvac over its first years , and shows the benefits of establishing a national effort to coordinate the many aspects of the vaccine and immunization system and put in place a federal advisory committee to ensure that the system functions to the benefit of the health and well - being of the american public ."
"notably , in acip recommended vaccination of all children against diseases ( i . e . , diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis , polio , measles , mumps , rubella , and haemophilus influenzae type b ) , and years later the recommendations cover diseases ( i . e . , the above plus hepatitis b , hepatitis a , rotavirus , pneumococcal disease , influenza , meningococcal disease , hpv , and varicella ) .","this growth demonstrates underscores significant innovation with respect to the development of vaccines , including the adoption of two vaccines to prevent forms of cancer ( i . e . , hepatitis b , hpv ) ."
"nvac activities during the first years focused predominantly on immunization program issues , in large part because cdc took advantage of the opportunity to use nvac as its acip equivalent for advice on assuring immunization programs deliver recommended vaccines .","consistent with this opportunity , nvac devoted considerable time to issues related to vaccine acceptance , supporting immunization across the lifespan , immunization mandates , and exemptions ."
"thus , the utility and impact of nvac likely encompasses more than its reports and recommendation .","the inclusion of two voting members who represent the vaccine industry may help to some degree with industry buy - in , although this remains difficult to document ."
"for example , the u . s . vaccine safety system and vicp represent the best such systems in the world , and the u . s . continues to lead in global vaccine innovation .","in the context of the broad system - wide topics considered by nvac , in some cases nvac contributed to system policies that cannot be attributed only to nvac ."
"in addition , in the u . s . , financing of programs to assure recommended vaccines for adults achieve high uptake remains a challenge that limits incentives to develop vaccines for adult markets .","the affordable care act removed one financial obstacle to vaccine uptake among adults by requiring insurers cover all acip recommended vaccines , but if altered may further detract from incentives to develop vaccines for adults ."
"financing for the development and delivery of vaccines , particularly adolescent and adult vaccines , also represents a topic we eect that nvac will continue to periodically consider , particularly with any significant changes to legislation and appropriations that finance or support vaccines and their delivery ( e . g . , the affordable care act , medicare access and chip reauthorization act , vfc program , potential future creation of a vaccines for adults program , the st century cures act , etc . )","as well as systemic changes ( e . g . , increased delivery of vaccines in pharmacies , implementation of medicare program merit - based incentive payment system and alternative payment model , etc ) ."
"although difficult to quantify , this review suggests that nvac played an important role in the improvements in the u . s . immunization enterprise over the past years .","given the many factors that impact on policy changes in the vaccine and immunization enter - prise , we encountered challenges associated with demonstrating attribution of specific policy changes to the recommendations made by nvac ."
"finally , as long as vaccine - preventable pathogens circulate globally , nvac will likely continue to play a role in promoting u . s . health security and u . s . efforts that enhance global immunization for humanitarian reasons .","in addition , vaccine hesitancy and vaccine confidence will likely continue to represent priorities , for which nvac will likely play a continued role in addressing public and professional concerns ."
beaur - m41 ( s ) ep10 induced a serological response similar to that of a commercial vaccine given at day - old though the commercial vaccine provided slightly higher efficacy .,these results are promising for the development of embryo safe efficacious ibv vaccines for in ovo application .
"however , as with any live - attenuated vaccine administered via the respiratory tract , which must replicate in order to be effective , vaccination at an early age can damage the epithelial lining of the trachea and depending on the extent of this damage , secondary bacterial infections can occur .","live - attenuated vaccines against infectious bronchitis are generally given to chicks at day of age in the hatch - ery by spray , or later in the field by either drinking water or spray ."
in ovo delivery gives the advantage that all vaccinations can be done prior to hatching as long as the vaccines are shown to be compatible and safe .,"whilst considerable work has been done on in ovo delivery of marek and infectious bursal disease vaccines , little work has been done on delivering ibv vaccines in ovo ."
"specified pathogen free ( spf ) white leghorn chicken embryonated eggs ( lohmann , germany ) were used .",all chicks were hatched in a contained environment and transferred to negative pressure isolators for the remainder of the eeriments .
the beaur - m41 ( s ) was passaged ten times on - 12 - day - old embryonated eggs to give beaur - m41 ( s ) ep10 .,"two commercial vaccines , nobilis ma5 , ( intervet , referred to as cv1 in the text ) and ib mm ( fort dodge , referred to as cv2 in the text ) , both of the massachusetts serotype were used ."
nasal discharge was assessed by gently squeezing the nares of the chicks and determining if any fluid was visible .,examination of general health was done daily during the course of the eeriments .
"ten , mm elants of each trachea were observed microscopically and the ciliary activity of each ring was scored according to the percentage of the cilia beating on the luminal surface .",chicks were killed by an intravenous injection of barbiturates and their tracheas removed aseptically .
"at and days post challenge birds from each group were euthanized , their tracheas removed and assessed for ciliary activity .",the chicks were bled and serum collected at weeks then challenged with virulent m41 ibv at weeks .
the chicks were allowed to hatch in separate hatchers and live chicks counted at days of incubation .,at and days post hatch the chicks were examined for nasal discharge .
"the eggs were marked , mixed in a single incubator and the hatch assessed by counting the marked eggs remaining .","fifty spf eggs were inoculated with the beaur - m41 ( s ) ( 10 eid ) , beau - r ( 10 eid ) or two different doses of the cv2 vaccines ( 10 or eid ) or with a placebo ."
"the eggs were marked , mixed in a single incubator and the hatch assessed by counting the marked eggs remaining .",fifty spf eggs were inoculated with the m41 - ck virus ( 10 eid ) or with a placebo .
in eeriments and all eggs were hatched from the same machine to avoid the influence of individual hatchers .,in eeriments and commercial vaccines were included to determine their effect on the hatchability .
the lowest hatch in the candidate vaccines was in the beau - r group which had four fewer chicks hatch than the placebo group .,this reduction in hatch may have been due to the pathogenicity of beau - r but could also been an effect of hatching the different groups in separate hatchers .
in addition the beaur - m41 ( s ) ep10 strain was included to determine if egg passage could improve the immunogenicity of this strain without affecting its pathogenicity .,inoculation with any of the candidate vaccines caused a lower hatch than the placebo ( 82% hatch ) in this eeriment with the beaur - m41 ( s ) ( 75% hatch ) vaccine candidate giving the best result ( fig .
in the third eeriment spf eggs were inoculated with eid of beaur - m41 ( s ) or beaur - m41 ( s ) ep10 .,inoculation with beaur - m41 ( s ) gave a higher hatch ( 70% hatch ) than the placebo ( 68% ) whilst inoculation with beaur - m41 ( s ) ep10 caused a slightly lower hatch ( 63% ) than the placebo ( fig .
m41 - ck gave % hatch in comparison to % hatch in the control group .,to exclude any variability in hatchers all eggs in this eeriment were placed in the same hatching unit .
"as the birds were held in isolators during each trial it was difficult to examine some of the clinical parameters associated with ibv ( tracheal rales , coughing and sneezing ) .",in eeriment in ovo inoculation with beau - r or beaur - m41 ( s ) did not cause any morbidity during the post hatch observation period .
analysis of ciliary activity post vaccination can be used as a measure of the safety of an ibv vaccine .,"in eeriment , three birds from the cv1 - vaccinated groups and five in each of beau - r and beaur - m41 ( s ) in ovo - vaccinated groups were euthanized days post hatch and their ciliary activity assessed ."
beau - r gave a lower antibody response than beaur - m41 ( s ) but this was not significant ( p = ) .,sixty percent of the beau - r vaccinates and % of the beaur - m41 ( s ) vaccinates had seroconverted at weeks post hatch .
the response to beaur - m41 ( s ) ep10 was significantly higher than both beaur - m41 ( s ) vaccine ( p = 02 ) and beau - r ( p = 02 ) which gave approximately equal responses with only % of birds seroconverting in each of these groups ( data not shown ) .,the cv1 vaccine given at day - old gave the highest antibody response in this eeriment with % of the birds responding .
no significant differences were seen in the serological responses induced by beau - r and beaur - m41 ( s ) in two eeriments ( fig .,"a and b ) and it is of interest to note that there was no dose dependency regarding the serological response or rate of seroconversion , a - fold more virus giving a similar response and seroconversion rate ( fig ."
b and c ) it can be speculated that the increase in protection observed with the beaur - m41 ( s ) was due to the m41 spike protein which is homologous to the spike protein of the challenge virus .,"alternatively , as a cytotoxic t cell response is thought to be important in protection against ib challenge it is possible that the % amino acid difference between beau - r and beaur - m41 ( s ) spike proteins contain relevant ctl epitopes for protection against m41 challenge ."
"eression of the m41 spike protein , rather than the beaudette spike protein , and further egg passage of the virus eressing the m41 spike protein improved the efficacy of the virus .",the eression of the m41 spike protein by beaur - m41 ( s ) did not alter the pathogenicity of the ribv on the basis of these criteria .
"the shift site sequence , ucc - uga - u , is not similar to other known frameshift sites .",the mechanism does not seem to involve re - pairing of peptidyl - trna in the new frame but rather reading or occlusion of a fourth base .
"programmed frameshifting is well known in the decoding of compact genomes such as retrotransposons and bacterial , yeast , plant , and animal viruses ( especially retroviruses ) , but only a few cases are known in cellular genes .","this programmed ribosomal frameshifting constitutes an important part of recoding or reprogrammed genetic decoding ( gesteland et al . , ) ."
"consequently , odc is not only short - lived like other proteins that control important cellular processes ( goldberg and st . john , ) , but its turnover is also regulated .","the c - terminal half of antizyme binds to odc , inducing a conformational change ( li and coffino , ) , allowing an additional internal sequence in antizyme to promote destabilization of odc ( li and coffino , ; ichiba et al . , ) ."
"while only a minute amount of antizyme is present in mammalian tissues ( around ppm of soluble protein ) , its mrna level is relatively high and not further elevated by polyamines ( matsufuji et al . , b ) .","antizyme synthesis is inhibited by cycloheximide but not actinomycin d ( fong et al . , ; matsufuji et al . , a ) ."
"in this cell line , antizyme synthesis is dependent on dexamethasone but is not further stimulated by polyamines , implying that the figure .","active antizyme was also produced in transfected mammalian cells from the cdna driven by mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat promoter ( murakami et al . , a ) ."
"to determine the entire mrna sequence , a genomic clone was isolated ( miyazaki et al . , ) in parallel with full - length cdna clones ( see results ) .","as reported here , an analysis of these clones revealed that antizyme is decoded from two orfs by ribosomal frameshifting that is dependent on polyamine levels ."
"their sequence is also identical with that of the ens in the genomic clone that was determined by $1 analysis with the partial cdna clone ( miyazaki et al . , ) .","they are identical except that they have different ' endpoints , and they contain the exact sequence present in the partial cdna clone z1 ( see introduction ) ."
"however , there is an increasing number of examples of programmed ribosomal frameshifting to eress one protein from overlapping orfs .","the eeriments presented here address the frameshift model and rule out the other possibilities , as discussed below ."
"to investigate frameshifting , the complete two orfs were inserted downstream of bacteriophage t7 rna promoter so that in vitro synthesized rna could be made and then translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates .","as a control , an in - frame construct , at205 , was prepared by deleting the t at nucleotide ( underlined in figure ) , which removes the stop codon at the end of orf1 , creating a continuous orf with the whole orf1 and the nonoverlapping part of orf2 ."
"orf2 does not appear to be eressed independently of initiation at orf1 , arguing against subsequent transpeptidation of orf1 and orf2 products .","these findings , taken together with the determination of orf1 n - terminal sequences , indicate that the reading frame for antizyme translation changes from orf1 to orf2 at some position within the overlap of the two orfs ."
"in contrast , translation of the in - frame mrna was efficient even at low spermidine concentrations and was somewhat suppressed by increasing concentrations of spermidine .","at the optimal concentration of mm of egenous spermidine , there is a - fold stimulation in antizyme synthesis over the level seen with no added spermidine , bringing the efficiency up to about % of the in - frame control ( figure c ; comparison with the in - frame control is necessary , since the small non - shift termination product cannot be detected ) ."
the efficiency of the shift can be determined from the ratio of radioactivity of the terminated and full - length products after calibrating the numbers of amino acid residues labeled in the two products .,these results ensure that the full - length product of the wild - type fusion is translated from two different reading frames and strongly suggest frameshifting into the + 1 frame .
deletions of the antizyme sequence to nucleotide ( a - 102 ) or ( a1 - 153 ) did not significantly change the frameshift efficiency .,"to narrow the regions containing these signals , several deletion mutants of the bmv coat - antizyme fusion were tested for frameshifting ( figure e , rig ht panel ) ."
"instead , an engineered form of radiolabeled protein synthesized in a reticulocyte lysate was sequenced .","rna was made in vitro from a construct with the last four codons of orf1 ( to nucleotide , which includes the presumed shift site and all the downstream sequence necessary for the efficient frameshifting as shown below ) flanked by two cassettes specifying recognition sites for the factor xa protease , which cleaves on the c - terminal side of ile - glu - gly - arg , the ' factor xa site was positioned such that three amino acids remain from orf1 after cleavage ( figure a ) ."
various mutations in the frameshift region of the bmv coat - antizyme fusion construct were compared for frameshift efficiency in a reticulocyte lysate .,"deletions of each one of the last three codons of orf1 , namely , a196 - 198 , a - 201 , and a202 - 204 , gave frameshift efficiencies of %, %, and % of the wild - type fusion , respectively ."
"changing the first codon base alters the trna specified , indicating that more than one trna can cause this frameshifting .","surprisingly , the first position of the last codon , u202 , could also be changed with no more than % decrease in frameshifting efficiency ."
the c201 to g mutation did not show any effect and creates a context with ugg immediately ' to the ucc shift site .,the results from sequence changes ' to the shift site suggested that there may be an unidentified stimulatory element .
these results show that the termination codon of orf1 is one of the important stimulators .,"in all the mutants of the termination codon tested , the frameshifting was increased by spermidine addition ( data not shown ) ."
"the downstream stimulator ( s ) for frameshifting was delimited by deletion of the sequence ' of the pseudoknot with retention of full frameshift activity ( figu re b , a269 - 682 ) .","if the deletion was limited to the potential pseudoknot region ( a209 - 268 ) , frameshifting decreased by %, suggesting the presence of a stimulator in this sequence ."
"spermidine stimulated frameshifting ( approximately - fold ) whether or not the pseudoknot was present , whether or not the stop codon was present , and with or without deletions ' to the stop codon ( data not shown ) .","in the absence of added spermidine , frameshifting was not detectable with these mutants ( data not shown ) ."
"the fragment does , however , promote readthrough of its uga stop codon , but this is unlikely to be of biological importance .","the nt fragment of antizyme is sufficient to promote polyaminedependent , specific + 1 frameshifting when transplanted to a new context , but not f . - ameshifting ."
"functional antizyme is encoded in orf2 alone , and the role of orf1 seems not to be for its protein product per se , but rather to provide for recoding regulation by polyamines .","the frameshifting stimulated by polyamines results in an increase in the amount of antizyme , which lowers intracellular polyamine levels by promoting turnover of a key enzyme in polyamine synthesis , odc ."
"neither of these trnas can pair in any of their anticodon positions to the + 1 frame , cgu , making re - pairing unlikely , this is further supported by results of changing ucc to acg , where again no base pairing is possible , yet the reduction in frameshifting efficiency is only %.",several possible mechanisms that do not involve re - pairing are compatible with the present data and cannot yet be distinguished ( of .
"it is much less than the - 9 nt usually found in frameshifting and readthrough ( except prokaryotic selenocysteine [ heider et al . , ] ) .","however , since the uga codon occupies the a site when the shifting occurs , the relative spacing between the shift site and the pseudoknot is nt ."
"it is not surprising that small , polycationic polyamines interact with nucleic acids and have general effects on translation ( atkins et al . , ; tabor and tabor , ) .","in antizyme decoding , polyamines stimulate frameshifting ( in vivo and in vitro , at physiological concentrations ) to afford autoregulatory control ."
"nine positive clones were selected out of x recombinants by plaque hybridization with a probe of the partial length antizyme cdna z1 ( matsufuji et al . , b ) .",oligo ( dt ) - primed cdna was synthesized from poly ( a ) + rna from the livers of sprague - dawley rats by use of a kit ( boehringer ) and inserted into the xzapii vector ( stratagene ) through ecori adaptors ( promega ) to construct a library .

"for immunoprecipitation ( kameji and pegg , ) , either ~ g of anti - antizyme igg ( matsufuji et al . , b ) or control rabbit igg or ill of anti - bmv rabbit serum ( atcc ) was added and incubated for rain .","after incubation at c for rain , ~ 1 of p ~ g / ~ l rnase a was added , incubated for a further rain , and analyzed by sds - page ."
"to elucidate the correlation between viral emergence and fip , a local isolate ( ntu156 ) that was derived from a fip cat was analyzed along with other worldwide strains .","containing an in - frame deletion of nucleotides in open reading frame c , the complete genome size of ntu156 ( 28,897 nucleotides ) appears to be the smallest among the known type ii feline coronaviruses ."
"feline coronaviruses ( fcovs ) are large , enveloped , positive - strand rna viruses with a genome of approximately , 200 nucleotides .","the fcovs belong to the genus alphacoronavirus , family coronaviridae , order nidovirales ."
fcovs are associated with diseases that range from subclinical and / or mild enteric infections to fatal infectious peritonitis .,"despite the high prevalence of fcovs in feline populations around the world , only - 12 % of seropositive cats develop feline infectious peritonitis ( fip ) ."
"to gain better evolutionary insight into type ii fcovs , we analyzed the complete genome of a novel type ii fcov isolate .","taking our data together with data from other strains , we discuss the evolution of type ii fcov ."
"ntu156 is relatively fast - growing , induces a coronavirus - typical syncytial cytopathic effect and is a type ii fcov .",all of the viruses used in this study for the sequencing of complete genome came from a stock virus passaged six times .
a total of primers for pcr were chosen from a relatively conserved region of the fcov genome .,"this reaction mixture was then briefly centrifuged and incubated at c for min , then at c for min , and finally at c for min ."
full - length genome sequencing of ntu156 was performed by single - round pcr with a set of overlapping pcr products ( average size bp ) that encompassed the entire genome .,"the nucleotide sequences of the targeted dna fragments were purified ( geneaid biotech , taipei ) and sequenced in both directions using an auto sequencer ( abi xl , usa ) ."
the complete sequences of ntu156 were then compared with other alphacoronaviruses and the results are summarized in table .,"multiple alignments of nucleic acid sequences were performed by the clustal w method using the megalign program ( dnastar inc . , wi , usa ) ."
"this finding is not surprising because the receptor for type ii fcov , feline aminopeptidase n , has been found to serve as a receptor for several covs , including canine , porcine , and human covs .","therefore , the interspecies recombination of type i fcov with any of the above viruses might occur in nature ."
"to answer that question , the amino acid sequence of genes retained at both ends of fcovs , ccovs , and tgevs , i . e . , nsp through nsp and the n and orf7 genes , were further aligned and compared ( table ) .",we asked whether the genes located in these regions are indispensable for fcov replication in cats .
"the nsp - 16 proteins are replication proteins with functions such as helicase activity ( nsp ) , nucleoside triphosphatase activity ( nsp ) , rna - triphosphatase activity ( nsp ) , eribonuclease activity ( nsp ) , rna cap formation ( nsp and nsp ) , and endonuclease activity ( nsp ) .","the genes exchanged through this double recombination include nsp - 16 , structure protein s ( spike ) , and accessory protein abc ."
the results showed that galanthus nivalis agglutinin ( gna ) and nelfinavir effectively inhibited fcov replication .,"in searching for agents that may prove clinically effective against fcov infection , compounds were screened for their antiviral activity against a local fcov strain in felis catus whole fetus - 4 cells ."
"this immunopathogenic disease of cats is similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) in humans ; both are characterized by an intense inflammatory response that compromises normal physiological function and contributes to a progressive debilitating condition , weight loss , fever , and systemic disease ( paltrinieri , ; perlman and dandekar , ) .","feline infectious peritonitis ( fip ) is a fatal disease in domestic and nondomestic felids caused by feline coronavirus ( fcov ) ( hartmann , ) ."
"ribavirin , a nucleoside analogue , was shown to inhibit the growth of fcov in vitro ( barlough and scott , ; weiss and oostrom - ram , ) ; nevertheless , the side effects hindered its clinical application ( weiss et al . , ) .","several studies have attempted to identify effective anti - fcov treatments for fip - diseased cats ( hartmann and ritz , ) ."
"these included carbohydrate - binding agents ( keyaerts et al . , ) , hiv protease inhibitors ( yamamoto et al . , ) , an antipsychotic drug ( ho et al . , ; zhang and yap , ) , an anthraquinone compound ( ho et al . , ) , a nucleoside analogue ( tan et al . , ) , and an interferon subtype .","because some of these sars - cov inhibitors and other commercially available antiviral agents might be promising candidates for controlling and treating fcov infection in cats , we carried out the present study and successfully identified two compounds that act effectively against a recently isolated fcov strain ."
"based on pharmacological activity , these antiviral agents were grouped as ( i ) nucleoside analogues : acyclovir , idoxuridine , and ribavirin ; ( ii ) protease inhibitors : atazanavir , indinavir , lopinavir / ritonavir , nelfinavir , and saquinavir ; ( iii ) reverse transcriptase inhibitors : efavirenz , lamivudine , lamivudine / zidovudine , nelvirapine , and stavudine ; ( iv ) compounds with other activities : emodin , galanthus nivalis agglutinin ( atrasheuskaya et al . , ) , and promazine .","details of each compound tested are listed in table gna , which were dissolved in double distilled water , the solvent for all the other compounds was dimethyl sulfoxide ."
"based on the results obtained from the cell viability tests , the highest concentration showing less than % cytotoxicity in fcwf - 4 cells was chosen for each of the test compounds ( table ) ; these chosen concentrations were premixed with ntu156 at a multiplicity of infection ( moi ) of 1 and incubated at c for h to monitor the effect on the preentry step .","the mixtures of compound and virus were then inoculated into fcwf - 4 cells in - well plates for h of adsorption , and followed by the replacement of mixtures by dmem with % fbs to monitor the effect on the entry step ."
"following h of adsorption , the mixture was removed , and dmem with % fbs was added .","at h postinfection , the cells were fixed and stained , and the cpe was counted ."
"each compound was twofold serially diluted and premixed with virus ( moi 1 ) , and then inoculated into fcwf - 4 cells and examined h postinfection for the presence of viral cpe .","the ic was calculated using the previously described method ( reed and muench , ) ."
p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant for a positive effect on the interaction of two compounds .,two - way analysis of variance was used for testing the effect of the interaction of two compounds .
"our clinical trials using nelfinavir as a mean to control fcov infection revealed that no obviously side effects , e . g . , diarrhea or nausea , as occasionally seen in human hiv patients taking this agent , was observed in the clinical healthy fcov - shedding cats receiving the dosage 5 mg to mg / kg / day per os .",this might also be the main factor that contributes to the high si data of nelfinavir on sars - cov in comparison to fcov besides the difference of cells used in both assays .
"this was surprising , given that the antiviral effect of nelfinavir has been demonstrated at the postentry step of sars - cov infection ( yamamoto et al . , ) .","under these conditions , the two effective compounds lost their anti - fcov activity when used by themselves ."
"with proper combination of effective agents targeting at different stages of viral replication , a cocktail therapy like treating hiv human patients may be available in the near future for cats suffering from fip .","as systemic application of gna might provoke antibody responses leading to inactivity of the compound , and the primary antibody response generally appears about weeks after the antigen stimulation ( murphy et al . , ) , the future therapeutic protocol will need to be designed to administer gna in an efficient dose within the first weeks , together with other effective antiviral agents like nelfinavir found in this study and some others currently under testing ."
"this antagonist has been shown to reduce mortality in another immune - mediated disease , dengue virus infection ( atrasheuskaya et al . , ) .","successful supplementary treatments may include antiviral drugs , interferon , and immunosuppressive therapy , and perhaps cytokine antagonists , such as the tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnf - alpha ) antagonist ."
"in this study , we demonstrate the synergistic antiviral effect of gna and nelfinavir on the inhibition of fcov replication in infected cells .","our results suggest that the combined use of these two agents is a potential therapy for preventing and treating fip cats , as long as diagnosis can be made early ."

"in addition , the synthesis of the required starting materials , functionalized arenes , can be a tedious task .",the application of these reactions to the synthesis of sterically encumbered or functionalized products can be difficult in some cases .
"herein , we report , for the first time , the synthesis of - ( arylsulfonyl ) phenols by [ 3 + 3 ] cyclocondensations of , 3 - bis ( silyloxy ) - 1,3 - butadienes with - arylsulfonyl - 3 - ethoxy - 2 en - 1 - ones .","these reactions allow a convenient and regioselective access to functionalized - ( arylsulfonyl ) phenols , which are not readily available by other methods ."
", 3 - bis ( silyloxy ) - 1,3 - butadienes a - g were prepared from the corresponding b - ketoesters in two steps .","- arylsulfonyl - 3 ethoxy - 2 - en - 1 - ones a - d were prepared , following a known procedure , by reaction of b - ketosulfones a - d with triethyl orthoformate and acetic anhydride ( scheme ) ."
"products a - m , derived from enones a - c , contain a methyl group located at carbon c - 3 of the phenol moiety .","in contrast , the presence of a substituent located at carbon atom c - 4 of the , 3 - bis ( silyloxy ) - 1,3 - butadiene has no significant effect on the yield ."
"finally , we will outline areas in need of further research , as understanding the relationships between infections and asthma has important implications for both asthma prevention and treatment , including potential new pathways that might target host immune response to select pathogens .","the main focus of this review is to summarize the available levels of evidence supporting or refuting the notion that persons with asthma or atopic disease have an altered susceptibility to selected pathogens , as well as discussing the biological mechanism ( s ) that might elain such associations ."
"infections in infancy , including respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) and rhinovirus ( rv ) , are known to be associated with an increased risk of asthma development .","furthermore , this has been demonstrated to be a dose response relationship , with severe episodes of infant bronchiolitis increasing the odds of both early childhood asthma and asthma - specific morbidity ."
"in a prospective study of rv infections in cohabitating couples consisting of one asthmatic and one non - asthmatic subject those with asthma had more frequent lower respiratory tract infections , along with symptoms which were more severe and of greater duration .",asthmatics have both increased frequency and severity of lower respiratory tract infections as compared to individuals without asthma ( fig ) .
"thus , asthmatics still may be at an increased risk for influenza related complications , but due to their medical history more likely to seek care earlier , resulting in improved outcomes .",the risk for community acquired bacterial and viral pneumonia has been estimated to be at least two fold in patients with asthma as compared to healthy controls .
children with atopic asthma were found to eerience % more symptomatic viral illnesses as compared to non - atopic asthmatics during peak virus season ( 1.19 vs . 1 per month ) .,allergen sensitized asthmatics also have a higher risk of hospital admission for asthma exacerbations as compared to non - sensitized asthmatics .
children with asthma have increased rates of both otitis media and gastroenteritis during infancy .,the increased susceptibility to infections among persons with asthma extends beyond the lungs ( fig ) .
"in a crosssectional , population - based prospective study of , 013 adolescents , asthma was an independent risk factor for nasopharyngeal colonization of s . pneumoniae , identified in % of subjects .",increased frequency of colonization with s . pneumoniae has also been demonstrated in asthmatics .
"in contrast , sutherland et al identified only % of suboptimally controlled asthmatics to have pcr evidence for m . pneumoniae or c . pneumoniae on lower airway endobronchial biopsy .","furthermore , the addition of clarithromycin did not improve asthma control making the clinical relevance of latent atypical bacterial infection unclear ."
results from other but not all ( 27 ; 35 ) studies have supported an increased prevalence of latent adenoviral infection in asthmatics likely due to varying viral detection techniques and small sample sizes .,twenty healthy children were included as controls with only adenovirus detected in one nasopharyngeal swab .
"persistent rsv infection has been documented days post infection in a mouse model and weeks post infection in a guinea pig model but similar findings have yet to be confirmed in human studies , indicating a key area in need of further research .","due to the strong relationship between rsv bronchiolitis in infancy and the development of asthma , latent rsv infection of asthmatics has also been suggested ."
"interestingly , these conditions are not typically seen in patients with other inflammatory skin conditions , such as psoriasis .","persons with atopic dermatitis are also highly susceptible to widespread disseminated viral infections including eczema mollusculatum , eczema herpeticum , and eczema vaccinatum ."
a variety of potential mechanisms have been proposed to elain why those with asthma and atopic disease appear to have increased susceptibility to select viral and bacterial pathogens ( fig ) .,"impaired innate immune responses have been observed in persons with asthma and atopic disease including deficient epithelial cell function , mucus overproduction , decreased interferon responses , and impaired alveolar macrophage function ."
"peptidase allergens disrupt intercellular tight junctions in human bronchial epithelial cell lines , thereby increasing permeability of the airway epithelium ( 55 ; 56 ) and the disruption caused by the dust mite allergen , der p1 , enhanced rsv replication within a human bronchial epithelial cell line .",these studies shed light on how the alteration of the airway epithelium among asthmatic and atopic persons may increase susceptibility to infections .
"mucus production is important in handling respiratory pathogens , and is both increased in quantity and viscosity in asthma .",endobronchial biopsies from asthmatic patients demonstrate airway goblet cell hyperplasia with increased numbers of mucus - secreting goblet cells in the epithelium and an increase in the size of the submucosal glands .
"more recently in vitro studies in asthmatic nasal epithelial cells have demonstrated lower production of ifn - post rv infection compared to healthy control epithelium , but higher severity of illness associated with higher levels of ifn - production by asthmatics in vivo .",bochkov et al and lopez - souza et al demonstrated no difference in interferon responses in asthmatic bronchial epithelial cells in vitro in response to rv infection as compared to healthy control subjects .
airway macrophages from children with moderate and severe poorly controlled asthma were found to have significantly blunted phagocytosis of s . aureus and increased apoptosis .,"children treated with inhaled corticosteroids were the control group in this study , and while that limits the interpretation , a later study also supported impaired alveolar macrophage function with altered airway and intracellular airway macrophage glutathione homeostasis in children with severe asthma as compared to children with moderate asthma ."
high il - 5 production by th2 cells at birth predicts future risk of severe respiratory infections in childhood ; concomitant il - 10 production by t cells at birth attenuated this risk .,"delayed postnatal maturation of the immune system , including a delayed transition from th2 to th1 bias , is a risk factor for respiratory infections ."
the downregulation of multiple immune response genes have also been identified in patients with atopic dermatitis .,"it has also been postulated that parental asthma or allergy may influence immune function , with maternal history of atopy or asthma identified as a risk factor for more severe infant hrv - associated illness and lower cytokine responses to innate stimulation by tlr2 , tlr3 , tlr4 and tlr9 agonists and in vitro stimulation by rsv seen in children with a parental history of allergy or asthma ."
"peisong et al discovered children with upregulated th2 immune signaling , due to an asthma associated genetic variant of stat6 , had increased resistance to infection with the helminth worm ascaris lumbricoides .",a similar relationship between atopy and helminth infection has been described in venezuelan children and in an african adult population .
"chronic responses to paramyviral and rsv infection have been demonstrated in mice consisting of airway hyperreactivity and goblet cell hyperplasia persisting for at least one year after complete viral clearance , and methacholine induced airway hyperresponsiveness up to days post viral inoculation , respectively .","other possible mechanisms for increased infection susceptibility include abnormal airway structure and function , due to prior infections and ongoing airway inflammation ."
infection latency or colonization may contribute to enhanced susceptibility to infections by promoting ongoing airway inflammation .,"in a mouse model , trace levels of parainfluenza virus have been shown to be associated with persistent activation of the nkt cellmacrophage innate immune axis and production of il - 13 leading to chronic mucus cell metaplasia and airway hyperreactivity ."
maternal smoking is a known risk factor for respiratory infections and the development of asthma ( 97 ; 98 ) and atopic disease but has more recently also been shown to attenuate neonatal immune function with impaired tlr - mediated immune responses identified in neonates whose mothers smoked during pregnancy .,passive smoke eure has also been shown in adolescents to be associated with higher rates of pneumococcal colonization of the nasopharynx .
"eure to diesel exhaust increases the susceptibility to influenza virus infection in respiratory epithelial cells both in vitro and in mice in vivo , possibly related to the downregulation of antimicrobial host defense molecules , including clara cell secretory protein and surfactant proteins a and d .","eure to ambient ozone results in the loss of lung epithelial integrity , a key innate immune defense mechanism of the airways ."
"proposed mechanisms by which vitamin d levels modulate immune function include induction of antimicrobial peptide eression , downregulation of tlr eression by monocytes , and inhibition of t and b cell proliferation ( 110 ; 111 ) .","some of these effects strengthen the immune system whereas others actually suppress immune function , making the exact role of vitamin d in the immune system as well as the ideal circulating levels still unclear ."
"furthermore , wos et al found no relationship between inhaled corticosteroid dose and rv presence in the lower airways of patients with bronchial asthma .","nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may actually be protective in persons with allergic rhinitis or asthma by resulting in restitution of the upper and lower airway epithelium , respectively ."
"whereas the current mainstay of therapy is inhaled corticosteroids which inhibit inflammation , more emphasis may need to be placed on therapies which bolster innate and / or adaptive immune responses in response to infection , or in deterring the long - term consequences of infection .",the suggestion of altered host susceptibility to specific viral and bacterial pathogens in persons with asthma and atopic disease has important implications for treatment and prevention .
"treatment of cells with egenous ifn - followed by infection with rv resulted in a normal anti - viral response to rv , including induction of apoptosis and reduced rv replication .",intrabronchial delivery of ifn - in an asthmatic cohort has not been effective as it induced bronchospasm with a significant decrease in fev .
the relationship between infections and asthma is still not fully understood .,"there has been historical debate over whether respiratory infections play a causal role , or severe infections are merely a marker of those predisposed to develop asthma ."
"however , proof for the existence of such factors has been limited and mainly anecdotal .","therefore , we sought evidence for genetic susceptibility to fip using feline high density single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) arrays in a genome - wide association study ( gwas ) ."
"another study indicated that the fecv - to - fipv mutation and fip occurs in at least % of older cats following fecv eure , but only in individuals that were immunocompromised ( poland et al . , ) .","therefore , additional extrinsic ( environment ) or intrinsic ( host ) factors must play an important role in actual disease occurrence ."
"confirmed cases of fip did not exist before the ' s ( reviewed pedersen , ) .","as such , cats have not had a long period of time to evolve significant immunity to the virus ."
"however , given sufficient numbers of cases and controls , it may be possible to identify regions of the genome containing relevant candidate genes .","the birman breed is ideal for such a study , given its high incidence of fip ( pesteanu - somogyi et al . , ) , relatively small population size and high linkage disequilibrium ( alhaddad et al . , ) ."
"a large number of snps ( n = 6,890 ) were not assigned to a chromosome or position at the time the array was developed and were therefore packaged on an artificial chromosome i . e . , "" chr . un . "" .","dna samples were genotyped with the illumina infinium hd feline k single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) beadchip array ( illumina inc . , san diego , ca ) by geneseek inc . , lincoln , ne ."
"multidimensional scaling of case and control cats from both the usa and denmark indicated that the two populations were closely related but geographically distinguishable , but with no stratification between cases and controls within the same countries ( fig .",the first step in this study was to select case and control populations for gwas based on available information .
"nineteen of highest ranking snps in analysis - 2 , including the top three ranked snps , were on chr . a1 ( data not shown ) .",seventeen of the snps formed a mb region flanked by the three highest ranking snps ( fig .
"however , none of these associations was totally concordant with the fip susceptibility phenotype .","therefore , the associations need to be further confirmed with gwas of additional case and control cats and sequencing of candidate genes for polymorphisms ."
"in contrast , a number of adjacent high ranking snps were associated with tnfsf10 , erap1 and erap2 , giving more confidence to these associations .","the distance between high ranking snps and potential candidate genes was another consideration , and the preference is for high ranking snps to lie within a candidate gene ' s coding region ."
"population substructure exists in all breeds of cats because of their short generation time , large numbers of offspring , and intense selection pressures applied by individual breeders .",analysis of gwas data was also complicated by case / control numbers and population substructure apparent in mds and from gif values .
"this effect was evident between gwas of analysis - 1 ( all cases vs . all controls , regardless of age or geography ) and analysis - 2 ( young cats with fip vs . older healthy cats , regardless of geography ) .","the removal or addition of relatively few animals in the current study caused strong peaks of association to lose significance or disappear altogether , weaker peaks to gain significance , and new peaks to appear ."
"there was a high degree of confidence in the fip diagnoses , because they were made by veterinarians knowledgeable about fip and who often worked closely with breeders on the problem .","the eure status of control cats was much more difficult to determine , even though fecv is enzootic in virtually all catteries ( pedersen , ) and the fecv to fipv mutation rate is relatively high ( poland et al . , ) ."
"however , two crucial questions regarding fip pathogenesis remain to be elained : ) why does fipv target a type of macrophage that has a peculiar tropism for venules in the omentum , serosal surfaces , meninges , and uveal tract , and ) why do these macrophages fail to undergo pathogeninduced apoptosis either by intracellular or extracellular signaling ?","targeting of a specific macrophage subset is most likely associated with the way the virus and host cell membrane interact , while polymorphisms within any or all of the five candidate genes identified in the present study are more likely to be associated with why infected macrophages remain persistently infected ."
this could be eected in situations where multiple genes contribute only small to moderate degrees of risk either independently or collectively ( epistasis ) and are not inherited uniformly by every individual .,complex traits must be also interpreted with clear guidelines in mind .
"confirmatory studies may require greater numbers of case and control cats , much denser snp arrays , and even whole genome sequencing .",confirmed fip susceptibility genotypes could be used to breed cats more resistant to fip .
"the heterogeneity of influenza viruses in their natural reservoir of wild waterfowl , and the growing diversity of influenza virus lineages affecting mammalian species ( including swine , equine , canine and others ) , suggests that future human infection with viruses of pandemic potential will continue to occur .","highly pathogenic avian influenza ( hpai ) h5n1 viruses have caused over human infections , with a % mortality rate ; among many of these fatalities were young , previously healthy , adults ( who , ) ."
"the high susceptibility of ferrets to influenza virus , and the ability of sick ferrets to transmit virus to healthy ferrets , was first demonstrated in ( smith et al . , ) .","ferrets and humans share similar lung physiology , and human and avian influenza viruses exhibit similar patterns of binding to sialic acids ( the receptor for influenza viruses ) , which are distributed throughout the respiratory tract in both species ( maher and destefano , ; van riel et al . , ) ."
"furthermore , many clinical signs of influenza virus infection in humans are not present in mice , and they are a poor model for virus transmission ( lowen et al . , ; schulman and kilbourne , ) .",guinea pigs have emerged as an alternative small mammalian model for this virus .
"human and avian influenza viruses replicate efficiently in the respiratory tract of ferrets without prior adaptation , and extra - pulmonary spread of virus results following infection with some hpai viruses .",the ferret is currently the only small mammalian model available that is equally well suited to studying both of these aspects of influenza pathobiology .
"ferret studies have also been instrumental in demonstrating the impact of mutations that confer resistance to antiviral drugs on overall virus fitness and their ability to transmit to uninfected animals ( herlocher et al . , ; herlocher et al . , ; yen et al . , ) .",the polygenic nature of influenza virus pathogenesis and transmission underscores the importance of using a mammalian model capable of assessing both of these parameters .
below we describe selected areas of investigation that are likely to eand our understanding of influenza virus infection in the coming years .,a greater understanding of influenza viruses and ferret biology as well as the continued development of sophisticated laboratory equipment has led to the ability of scientists to examine numerous properties not previously studied in the ferret model .
the development of a method to measure the number of viable influenza viruses in droplets and droplet nuclei exhaled from infected animals has furthered the utility of this model .,"however , only recently has a rigorous method of ensuring standard doses of virus inoculum during aerosol delivery been reported , and a comprehensive comparison of intranasal and aerosol methods of inoculation been conducted ."
"furthermore , comprehensive analyses of serum chemistry profiles have allowed for detailed measurement of numerous parameters in the ferret that are frequently observed in severe human influenza virus infection .",the ability to measure these parameters throughout the duration of an eeriment by collecting samples during scheduled anesthesia of ferrets makes this an important contribution towards the standard pathotyping of viruses in this model .
"with this pandemic was due to bacterial pneumonia that developed post - infection ( morens et al . , ) .","studies in mouse and ferret models corroborate the finding that previous infection with influenza virus can render a host more susceptible to secondary bacterial infection ( peltola et al . , ) ."
"although the research in this model is largely limited to drug - or antibody - induced immunosuppression , additional future studies evaluating influenza virus pathogenicity and transmissibility in the context of immunosuppression should allow for a greater understanding of influenza virulence in immunodeficient populations .","immunocompromised ferrets ( achieved either by treatment with chemotherapy drugs or by depleting c + and / or cd4 + t cells ) were found to safely tolerate live , attenuated influenza vaccines ( huber and mccullers , ; min et al . , ) ."
"as described in this primer article , the ferret is an excellent small mammalian model that can recapitulate many of the hallmarks of human influenza virus infection .","given the wealth of information that can be generated while studying respiratory virus infection in this model , ferrets offer numerous advantages over other small mammalian models and are an ideal laboratory species to measure the most crucial aspects of influenza virus infection in the context of improving public health ."
"as the world watches the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus ( 2019 - ncov ) outbreak , it is important to reflect on the lessons that can be learned from this and previous emerging zoonotic viruses ( ezv ) in a comparative and analytic way .","although the source of - ncov is yet to be confirmed , early findings suggest a high possibility of a bat origin ."
"among the eight international eerts invited , seven were veterinarians or those working in animal health .","by contrast , the six - member chinese team only had one participating veterinarian or animal scientist ."
"we characterized eures and demographics of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus cases reported to the saudi arabia ministry of health during july - october , , and june - september , .",molecular characterization of available specimens showed that circulating viruses during these periods continued to cluster within lineage .
"since , healthcare - associated transmission has decreased as infection prevention and control practices have improved ; however , sporadic cases continue to be reported , often associated with contact with dromedaries .",surveillance and routine investigation of recent mers cases are critical to monitor the epidemiology of this emerging pathogen .
"during the eure period , ( 50% ) sporadic case - patients reported camel contact : had direct contact ( touching ) , indirect contact ( visiting a setting with camels or eure to others with direct camel contact ) , and contact that could not be further classified .","among patients with camel contact , also reported visiting a healthcare facility without a known mers - cov outbreak for a reason unrelated to their subsequent mers illness ."
"mers - cov infection continues to be reported periodically among those without known high - risk eures , warranting further investigation .","recently circulating viruses remain in lineage , the predominant circulating strain in saudi arabia since ."
evolution of this virus should be closely monitored so that prevention and control measures can be taken should it become more virulent .,"we identified a novel mink orthoreovirus , mrv1hb - a , which seems to be closely related to human strain mrv - 2 tou05 , which was isolated from children with acute necrotizing encephalopathy in ."
also reported the isolation of a reovirus from the feces of mink with diarrhea in china .,"however , to our knowledge , no genetic evidence of mrv strains isolated from mink has been reported ."
we isolated a novel mrv strain ( named mrv1hb - a ) from a mink with diarrhea in hebei province in northern china .,"to track virus evolution and look for evidence of genetic reassortment , we used pcr sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to compare genetic relatedness of mrv1hb - a and other orthoreoviruses ."
"on the basis of these data , we conclude that the novel type mink reovirus , designated mrv1 - hb - a , might have originated from reassortment between human and swine strains .","otherwise , the s3 gene showed high identity with type human reovirus tou05 ( 98% identity ) and porcine reovirus shr - a ( 94% identity ) strains ( figure ) ."
"in view of the lack of sequence data for the reovirus from mink in public databases , addition of the complete genome sequencing information for the mink reovirus will aid in the characterization of mammalian reovirus diversity and evolution .","although mrvs were assumed to cause rather mild respiratory or gastrointestinal diseases , recent findings indicate the occurrence of higher virulent mrv strains in man and other mammals ."
"a total of faecal samples of diarrhoeic dogs were tested simultaneously by conventional and fluorogenic rt - pcr : were negative by both techniques , whereas tested positive by conventional rt - pcr and by the established ccov fluorogenic assay .","one sample , which was positive by conventional rt - pcr , gave no signal in the fluorogenic assay ."
"ccov belongs to the group i coronaviruses , which also include the transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine ( tgev ) , the porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus ( pedv ) , the porcine respiratory coronavirus ( prcov ) , the feline coronaviruses ( fcovs ) and the human coronavirus e ( hcov e ) .","canine coronavirus ( ccov ) , a member of the family coronaviridae , is an enveloped , single - stranded , positive - sense rna virus , responsible for mild to severe enteritis in pups ."
the ' one third of the genome consists of other orfs encoding the struc - tural proteins and the other non - structural ones .,"the structural proteins comprise the s , e , m and n proteins encoded by orf2 , orf4 , orf5 and orf6 , respectively ( enjuanes et al . , ) ."
"in young pups , sometimes in combination with other pathogens , ccov infection may cause severe diarrhoea , vomiting , dehydration , loss of appetite , and , occasionally , death .","ccov shedding in faeces occurs for - 9 days post - infection ( keenan et al . , ) ."
"several rt - pcr based methods have been developed for detecting ccov rna in the faeces of dogs , but none of these were designed to be quantitative ( bandai et al . , ; naylor et al . , ; pratelli et al . , pratelli et al . , , c .","moreover , conventional rt - pcr assays are time consuming and contain a certain risk of carryover contamination due to the post - pcr manipulations and a second amplification step in nested pcr systems , especially when a high sample throughput is required ."
the fluorogenic assay was then applied to detect and quantify viral load in ccov naturally infected dogs and to trace the course of ccov infection in the faeces of a dog eerimentally infected with a field ccov strain .,the analytical performance of the ccov fluorogenic rt - pcr was evaluated in comparison to that of a conventional qualitative rt - pcr assay .
"in addition , one dog , months of age , which had been tested negative for ccov antigen in the faeces by rt - pcr ( pratelli et al . , ) and for ccov antibodies by elisa ( pratelli et al . , a ) , received ml ( 2 ml intranasally and ml orally ) of a cell culture medium containing tcid / 50 l of a ccov field strain , as previously described ( pratelli et al . , b ( pratelli et al . , , .",faecal samples of the infected dog were collected daily for days and subjected to both ccov conventional rt - pcr and real - time testing .
"total rna was extracted from each faecal sample with qiaamp rneasy mini kit ( qiagen gmbh , hilden , germany ) in accordance with the manufacturer ' s protocol .",the starting material consisted of mg of faeces for each sample .
aliquots of each dilution were frozen at c and used only once .,"ten - fold dilutions of the rna transcripts were carried out in te ( tris - hcl , edta , ph ) buffer containing g carrier rna ( trna from escherichia coli , sigma - aldrich srl , milan , italy ) per ml ."
"primers and probe were synthesized by mwg biotech ag ( ebersberg , germany ) .",the taqman probe was labeled with - carboxyfluorescein ( fam ) at the end and with - carboxytetramethylrhodamine ( tamra ) at the end .
"triplicates of the standard dilutions and rna templates were subjected simultaneously to reverse transcription ( rt ) with geneamp rna pcr ( applied biosystems , applera italia , monza , italy ) .","one microliter of each triplicate of standard dilutions or template rna was reverse transcribed in a reaction volume of l containing pcr buffer ( kcl mm , tris - hcl mm , ph , 3 ) , mgcl mm , mm of each deoxynucleotide ( datp , dctp , dgtp , dttp ) , rnase inhibitor u , mulv reverse transcriptase u , random hexamers u . synthesis of c - dna was carried out at c for min , followed by a denaturation step at c for min ."
fluorogenic pcr was performed in an i - cycler iq tm real - time detection system ( bio - rad laboratories srl ) and the data were analysed with the appropriate sequence detector software ( version ) .,the accumulation of the pcr products was detected by monitoring the increase in fluorescence of the reporter dye .
"briefly , pcr amplification was carried out geneamp rna pcr ( applied biosystems , applera italia ) and the following thermal conditions : reverse transcription at c for min , inactivation of mulv reverse transcriptase at c for min , cycles of c for min , c for min , c for min , with a final extension at c for min .","conventional rt - pcr , amplifying a bp fragment of the orf5 of ccov , was carried out as previously described ( pratelli et al . , ) ."
"to compare the analytical sensitivity , - fold dilutions of the standard rna , ranging from to copies / l , were tested by both fluorogenic and conventional rt - pcr .","in addition , - fold dilutions in dulbecco ' s minimal essential medium ( d - mem ) of the ccov vaccinal strain / 98 - 3 c ( pratelli et al . , ) , starting from 0 tcid / 50 l , were processed ."
"the cv between runs and within - run was 4 and 3% , respectively .",the intra - assay reproducibility was determined by pipetting the same standard copy number ( 10 molecules ) times on the same - well reaction plate .
"in contrast , the detection limit of conventional rt - pcr was about molecules .","on the other hand , this assay was able to quantify correctly samples with more than copies / l of template , since the linearity of the generated standard curve persisted up to the highest titre of in vitro - transcribed rna analysed ."
"in addition to its greater sensitivity , this technique is rapid , allowing several samples to be processed in few hours , with a large increase in throughput .","the assay is a closed system in which the tube is never opened post - amplification , and this eliminates the possibility of cross - contamination of new samples with products amplified previously ."
"among the faecal samples collected from the ccov eerimentally infected dog , four were only found to be positive by the fluorogenic assay , probably due to their low viral load combined with the higher sensitivity of the taqman assay .","conversely , one of the faecal samples of dogs infected naturally were only found to be positive by conventional rt - pcr ."
"theoretically , ccov amounts in the faeces could be assessed by virus titration on cell cultures .","however , the low sensitivity of ccov isolation and , mainly , the appearance of ccov specific antibodies in the faeces after the challenge may affect this virological assay ( personal observation ) ."
"here , we investigated the roles of klk1 and kallistatin in influenza virus infection .","we show that the levels of klk1 increased , whereas those of kallistatin decreased , in the lungs of mice during influenza virus infection ."
"taking the data together , we determined that klk1 and kallistatin contribute to the pathogenesis of influenza virus by affecting the cleavage of the ha peptide and inflammatory responses .",this study provides a proof of principle for the potential therapeutic application of kallistatin or other klk1 inhibitors for influenza .
"infection by influenza virus is initiated by cleavage of ha0 into ha1 and ha2 subunits and leads to the eure of the hydrophobic n terminus of ha2 , the fusion peptide , which facilitates fusion of the viral envelope with the host endosomal membrane .",proteolytic cleavage of the precursor ha molecule by host trypsin - like proteases is required for viral infectivity .
"klk1 , which is synthesized as the proenzyme prekallikrein and activated by plasmin or plasma kallikrein , is ubiquitously eressed , and the klk1 - kinin system exerts various biological activities in the cardiovascular , renal , central nervous , and immune systems .","klk1 ( also known as tissue kallikrein ) is responsible for cleavage of kininogen to release kinins ( bradykinin - related peptides ) , which mediate the regulation of smooth muscle contraction , vascular permeability , vascular cell growth , inflammatory cascades , electrolyte balance , neutrophil chemotaxis , and pain induction ."
"moreover , eerimental rhinovirus infection in individuals with asthma increased klk1 activation , accompanied by increased interleukin ( il - 8 ) eression .","klk1 and kinin levels were elevated in the respiratory tracts of patients with asthma , rhinitis , bronchitis , and pneumonia ."
the aim of this study was to investigate the potential roles of klk1 and kallistatin in influenza virus infection .,we tested whether klk1 can cleave and activate ha to promote viral infection and whether kallistatin can inhibit viral production and ameliorate influenza virus pathogenesis .
"to rule out the possibility of having serum plasminogen from the culture medium , we washed the mdck cells extensively with pbs and cultured the cells with serum - free medium in the absence of trypsin in all the in vitro eeriments .","ha can be cleaved by plasmin , which is converted from plasminogen by plasminogen activators present in calf serum ."
recombinant rat klk1 proteins were produced and purified as previously described .,"recombinant human kallistatin proteins were purchased from abcam ( cambridge , united kingdom ) ."

"this chimeric gene , flanked by ndv transcription signals , was inserted into the ndv antigenomic cdna in the same way as described above ( fig .","as a potential strategy to increase the efficiency of incorporation of gd into the ndv vector virion , we made another construct in which the ectodomain of gd was fused with the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the ndv f protein ."
sequence analysis of the gd gene of the resulting virus preparations showed that the integrity of the gd gene was preserved and stably maintained even after passages .,"to determine the stability of the gd gene in the rlasota / gdfl and rlasota / gdf viruses , the recovered viruses were passaged five times in embryonated chicken eggs and five times in chicken embryo fibroblast df - 1 cells ."
"fluorescence histograms of df1 cells infected with rlasota / gdfl , rlasota / gdf and rlasota viruses are shown in fig .",the cells were treated with gd - specific monoclonal antibodies followed by staining with alexa fluor conjugated goat anti mouse igg antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry .
"surprisingly , it was the native gd eressed by rlasota / gdfl , rather than the chimeric gd eressed by rlasota / gdf , that was incorporated into the virions ( fig .",both of the recombinant viruses were purified through sucrose gradients and the viral proteins were analyzed by coomassie blue staining of sds - page gels .
"these results suggested that the transmembrane domain of gd is highly efficient in directing incorporation into the heterologous ndv envelope , and that the foreign gd does not appear to displace the native ndv proteins .","quantification of ndv np , p , m , f , hn and l protein bands showed that the molar ratios of these proteins remained unaffected in rla - sota / gdf and rlasota / gdfl viruses compared to those of parental rlasota virus ( data not shown ) ."
both these tests indicated that incorporation of both versions of bhv - 1 gd into ndv virions did not increase the pathogenicity of the recombinant viruses in chickens .,"the icpi values of rlasota , rlasota / gdfl and rlasota / gdf were ( table ) ."
the serum dilution giving > 60% plaque reduction was considered the neutralizing end point .,c neutralization titers were determined by a plaque reduction assay in mdbk cells .
nine - 12 week old calves seronegative for ndv and bhv - 1 were randomly divided into groups of three .,"each group was immunized once with a single dose of pfu of rlasota , rla - sota / gdfl or rlasota / gdf virus by the combined in and it route ."
"these results suggested that the ndv vectors replicated in the respiratory tract of calves , leading to induction of antibodies against ndv .",these results are in agreement with the results of our previous study .
these responses developed in most of the animals after week of immunization and peaked by day ( fig .,"our results showed that all the calves immunized with rlasota / gdfl and rlasota / gdf viruses developed bhv - 1 specific igg and iga antibody responses in serum and nasal secretions , respectively ."
b the hemagglutination inhibition ( hi ) titers are eressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution causing complete inhibition of four ha units of ndv .,"a calves received a single in / it immunization with the indicated rndv as described in table , and were challenged in with bhv - 1 on day . b sera were taken on the indicated day post - immunization , and the neutralization titers were determined by a % plaque reduction assay ."
"in animals immunized with rlasota / gdf , the peak mean titer of challenge virus was approximately log / ml on day , after which it decreased to log / ml on days , , and , with shedding terminated by day .","in animals immunized with rlasota / gdfl , the mean titer of challenge virus did not exceed log / ml , and shedding terminated by day ."
"in contrast to other viral vectors that encode large number of proteins , such as herpes viruses and pox viruses , ndv encodes only eight proteins ; therefore , there is less competition for immune responses between vector proteins and the eressed foreign antigen .",ndv replicates in the cytoplasm and does not integrate into the host cell dna .
thus prior immunity against common bovine viruses should not affect the replication and immunogenicity of the vector .,"recently , we have shown that in and it inoculation of calves with the lentogenic ndv strain lasota resulted in an asymptomatic infection of the respiratory tract with induction of mucosal and systemic antibody responses against ndv ."
native or recombinant bhv - 1 gd has been shown to induce neutralizing antibodies in serum and protection from challenge .,"monoclonal antibodies against gd prevent infection , and thus gd is an independent neutralization antigen ."
"the immune response produced by a single immunization with the rlasota / gdfl or rlasota / gdf vaccine was not sufficient to prevent bhv - 1 shedding following challenge , but the virus titers and duration of shedding were reduced as compared to the control group .","a single intranasal immunization of calves with ndv - vectored vaccines based on the avirulent lasota strain induced gd - specific igg and iga responses in serum and nasal secretions , respectively ."
"hence , the incomplete protection generated by vaccination with ndv vectors eressing only the gd might be overcome by simultaneously administering ndv vectors eressing the gb and gc proteins .","second , it has been shown that , besides gd , the gb and gc surface glycoproteins also are immunodominant antigens , and are the targets of neutralizing antibodies and are major antigens for the cellular immune response [ 15 , ."
similar variation in the immune response among animals vaccinated by gd and gb has also been reported previously .,one calf had a low immune response compared to those of the other two calves .
"another possibility is that gd might accumulate at the cell surface in a higher molar amount compared to the ndv proteins , leading to more efficient incorporation .","however , it remains unelained why the chimeric gd protein containing the cytoplasmic and transmembrane from the ndv f protein accumulated efficiently at the cell surface yet was not significantly incorporated ."

"initially , patients of all ages were entered into the study at both morning and evening surgeries .","however , because of incompleteness of data ( no pulmonary function tests in patients under - years - old , and no presentation pulmonary function for evening surgery patients ) , the paper describes the results of patients aged years or over referred for study from the morning surgery only ."
"during the study period , forty - two episodes were investigated in such patients .","thirty patients attended both follow - up appointments , four attended one only and did not attend either follow - up appointments , an overall re - attendance rate of %."

"based on the weekly returns data for the years to , the mean annual attack rate for acute bronchitis is cases per population per week ( l ) .",hospital inpatient enquiry data suggests that less than 5% of cases of acute bronchitis are admitted to hospital .
"since ours was a descriptive study , we chose to allow the gps free rein to determine what they regarded as acute bronchitis .","interestingly , the results of the mrc / phls study - where acute bronchitis was defined as ' productive cough and rhonchi ' - and our study are strikingly similar ( fig ."
bacteria were fotmd infrequently ( in only three cases ) and there were no features that distinguished these cases from the others investigated .,"the bacterial identification rate was lower than the studies of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis which is what might be eected , in view of the colonization of the respiratory tract by bacteria in patients with chronic airways disease ."
"we believe therefore , that it is likely that the micro - organisms we identified were responsible for the illness .",the mrc / phls study included a control group and showed significantly lower microbiological identification rates in these individuals than the patient groups .

"nanoplasmid vaccinated mice had increased antibody responses as compared to those receiving our conventional pwrg7077 - based vaccines when delivered by im injection , and these responses were further enhanced by the inclusion of the innate immune agonist genes .",the nanoplasmid veev dna vaccines also significantly increased protection against aerosol veev challenge as compared to the pwrg7077 veev dna vaccine .
"natural mosquito - borne transmission of veev to humans can result in severe neurological disease , but aerosol veev infection may yield increased morbidity and mortality compared to that observed with natural infection .",- 20 we previously demonstrated that a candidate veev dna vaccine ( pwrg / veev ) eressing codon - optimized e2 and e1 envelope glycoprotein ( gp ) genes delivered by im - ep elicits robust veev - specific immune responses and protects mice and nonhuman primates ( nhps ) against aerosol veev challenge .
"specifically , we evaluated the immune responses and protective efficacy elicited by each of these vaccine candidates following im injection in a murine model .","here , we elored the potential benefit of nanoplasmid vectors engineered to eress the codon - 93 optimized veev and ebov gp genes without and with co - eression of the innate immune agonists ."
the protection observed for this group was also significantly higher than that of the im vaccination groups .,"as observed previously , all mice in the pwrg7077 / veev im - ep control displayed no clinical signs of disease post - challenge and all survived ."
"the mice were monitored daily for clinical score , and survival .","mice were subsequently challenged on day with , 000 pfu of mouse - adapted ebov mayinga ' 76 ( ma - ebov ) via the ip route ."
"further , log transformations were applied to vlp end - point elisa titers using graphpad software as described above .",kaplan meier survival curve analysis using a log rank test was performed to determine p value significance of vaccinated groups surviving lethal challenge compared to the control group using graphpad prism for windows .
"despite their ability to trigger potent innate and adaptive immune responses , the widespread use of dna vaccines has been hampered logistically by the requirement of specialized methods such eeriments , significantly increased percentages of veev e1 + , veev e2 + , and ebov gp + cells were observed for the nanoplasmid constructs as compared to the pwrg7077 - based constructs up to seven days post - transfection ( figure b , d , e ) .",representative histogram plots of veev e1 eression are shown in figure s1 .
"since vaccination with the nanoplasmid vectors improved the protective efficacy of our veev vaccine in the context of im delivery in the absence of ep , we eanded our studies to evaluate the benefit of the nanoplasmid vectors for vaccination against ebov .","because we did not observe a significant difference in immunogenicity or protective efficacy between the ntc - 167 erna / veev and ntc - erna - cpg / veev vaccines , we chose to only include the ntc - erna - 168 cpg / ebov vaccine in this study ."
"vaccination with the ebov nanoplasmids also did not improve ebov - specific ifn - + and il - 2 + t cell responses as quantified by elispot ( figure e , f ) .","we also observed slight increases in ebov - neutralizing antibody titers for both nanoplasmid vaccines and igg2a antibody production for the ntc - erna - cpg / ebov group , although not to statistically significant levels ( figure b - d ) ."
"twenty - nine days after the second vaccination , the remaining mice were challenged with , 000 pfu of ma - ebov by intraperitoneal ( ip ) injection .","all mice in the empty vector control group exhibited clinical signs of disease to include severe weight loss and ruffled fur , and all succumbed to disease or were euthanized in accordance with early endpoint criteria by day post - infection ."
"despite the importance of rig - i signaling in generating antigen - specific t cells , we did not measure a significant increase in the numbers of ifn - + or il - 2 + t cells for either antigen .","instead , it appears that the inclusion of the isrna innate immune agonist had the greatest influence on vaccine immunogenicity ."
"although we were not able to quantify significant changes in protection to ebov challenge at the dna dose tested here , it is noteworthy that nanoplasmid vaccination did not negatively impact protective efficacy .","in fact , the sustained weight seen in the ntc - erna - cpg / ebov group suggests that the isrna may have the ability to augment protective efficacy beyond what was measured here ."
"overall , our results demonstrate that vaccination with next - generation nanoplasmid vectors can improve dna vaccine immunogenicity when delivered by simple im injection in the absence of ep .","furthermore , the inclusion of innate immune agonists , such as dsrna and / or cpg motifs , can significantly boost protective efficacy ."
nanoplasmid dna vaccine vectors can improve the protective efficacy of dna vaccines in the absence of electroporation .,here we show that intramuscular injection of nanoplasmid vectors eressing the glycoprotein genes of venezuelan equine encephalitis virus ( veev ) and ebola virus ( ebov ) protect against lethal viral challenge in mice .

") ; ) epomicin and mg132 , proteasome inhibitors , block the degradation of bach1 in huh - 7 cells ( fig .",") in a dose - dependent manner , suggesting that down - regulation of bach1 by znmp is mediated by a proteasome - dependent degradation ; and ) znmp does not bind to the heme - binding motifs of bach1 ( fig ."
"these heterodimers bind to mares , also known as anti - oxidant responsive elements ( ares ) , and suppress eression of genes that respond to maf - containing heterodimers and other positive transcriptional factors .","after binding heme , bach1 loses its dna binding activity and then it is erted out of nuclei by triggering a crm1 - dependent mechanism ."
"znmp produced a profound and rapid degradation of bach1 in human hepatoma huh - 7 cells , and also in human stellate lx - 2 and nih t3 cells ( data not shown ) , suggesting that znmp - dependent degradation of bach1 exists in many types of cells .",bach1 degradation by snmp and heme have recently been reported .
"so far , two distinct systems for protein degradation have been found in mammals : the lysosome system and the ubiquitin - proteasome system .","in the ubiquitin - proteasome pathway , substrates are first marked for degradation by covalent linkage to multiple molecules of ubiquitin and then are hydrolyzed by the s proteasome , a kda atp - dependent proteolytic complex ."
"recent data of igarashi et al indicated that the four c - terminal cysteine - proline ( cp ) motifs in bach1 are essential for heme binding , and that this binding is one of the mechanisms by which heme upregulates ho - 1 .",more recent data showed that heme binds to bach1 in two modes located in bach1 btb ( 179 - 739 aa ) .
the greater degree of inhibition of red cell development by zinc vs tin porphyrins previously described may similarly be related to the more rapid and dramatic effect of zinc vs tin porphyrins on bach1 degradation .,"the findings of the present paper suggest that some or all of the up - regulation of ho - 1 protein levels produced by tin or zinc porphyrins is due to their abilities to degrade bach1 , thereby lifting the tonic repression that bach1 exerts on ho - 1 gene eression [ 5 , , ."

"however , the data were consistent with the presence of a kink at the center of the etm a - helix , and it did not fit completely either computational model .","herein , we have used native etm , without flanking lysines , and show that the helix orientation is now consistent with one of the predicted models ."
coronaviruses are enveloped viruses responsible for a variety of acute and chronic diseases .,"their members have an envelope ( e ) protein , embedded in the membrane , which is critical for virion morphogenesis ."
"at the same time , these mutations leave unaffected those models representing the native backbone structure .","under these evolutionary constraints , only two models compatible with ion channel activity were found , both pentameric , referred to as models a and b ."
"etm was isotopicallylabeled with c o , at nine native residues , except at f - 23 , where we used ala because of the lack of labeled phe .","in addition , to facilitate purification , etm was flanked by two lysines at each n - and c termini ( k - etm - k ) , as it has been shown for various a - tm oligomers that even four flanking lysines at each c - and n - terminus do not affect oligomerization during sds - page ."
"we note that the use of label f - 23 , instead of a - 23 , should not only affect the v value at f - 23 , but also the calculated value for the preceding and following residue .","indeed , the rotational orientation , v , is calculated by combining two consecutive residues , which are assumed to be separated by dv for canonical a - helices ."
"thus , from the measured dichroic ratios of the k - etm - k sample , r helix and r site ( shown in the supplementary material , table , data s1 ) , we recalculated the orientational data for the labeled residues and .","the infrared spectra obtained for k - etm - k were similar to those obtained previously , and are not shown ."

"public opinion by involving three main actors : the government , media , and netizens .","sir allowed us to elore the number of participants in the middle segment , the participation of the media and the government , and the impact of various factors that influence the behavior of each subject and the interactions between subjects ."
"there are two possible values forg a ( t ) in the model : = g ( t ) a represents government support of communication , and = g ( t ) a represents government limitation of communication .","to understand this effect , g a eresses the government ' s attitude toward a specific emergency at a given time ."
government credibility ( g b netizens ' and the media ' s trust of the government and the distribution of credibility at a given point in time can be represented as g b ( t ) .,both the initial and ongoing credibility values differ for each specific example since the government takes different attitudes toward a crisis .
"this study assumes that all media publish information on a crisis ; therefore , the information disclosure speed is never .","in the simulation model , the closer g d ( t ) is to , the faster disclosure speed is ."
supervision and leadership ( g e the government supervises and publicizes the extent of the emergencies as reported by network media .,"this is eressed as g e ( t ) in the simulation model , which takes values in consecutive intervals of ."
"however , the attitude of the media is also affected by netizens and the government .","media adopt different attitudes toward emergencies , and these attitudes determine public opinion trends ."
"in the simulation model , the media ' s authority is represented bymd n ( t ) .","the larger this value , the more influence a media source has on both netizens and the government ."
"in the simulation model , = p ( t ) i refers to netizens ' inclination to disseminate emergency information .",netizen attitudes : individual netizens have different ideologies that affect whether and how they share information about an emergency .
"if q i ( t ) = - 0.9 , then a netizen has a moderate ability to spread information .","if q i ( t ) = - 1 , a netizen has a significant influence ."
"in the simulation model , this is conveyed throughx i ( t ) ; credibility is randomly assigned a value between and .","if = x ( t ) i , then a netizen i during event t will not believe information nor spread it ."
= y ( t ) i implies that the netizen is affected by other subjects and adapts his / her behavior accordingly .,"netizens ' desire to disseminate : netizens each have their own concerns and preferences ; so , their enthusiasm over sharing information in the face of an emergency differs ."
"the more important a netizen views an event , the easier it is to accept and disseminate information regarding that event .","this paper assumes that a given emergency has the same importance for netizens , the government , and the media withi a ( t ) indicating the importance of moment t , with values randomly selected between and ."
"programming a values in the netlogo software show that internet users ' desire to spread information declines over time , as duration ( time since the occurrence of the event ) changes netizens ' desire to spread information .","where i c ( t ) is the time - effect value of the sudden event at time t , is the time - dependent feature scale factor of the target information , and a is a constant that can be adjusted in the iterative process in the simulation model ."

"if = a ( t ) i , then netizen j is interested in the event and will continue to pay attention to messages on the topic .","if = a ( t ) i , then netizen j is very interested in the event and actively spreads information regarding it ."
"if = ai ( t ) , then netizen i is the recipient of an event .","if = ai ( t ) , then netizen j becomes the communicator of an event ."
the influence function of netizens i on netizens j at time t is as follows :,"however , the government is influenced by the opinions generated by the media and netizens , and netizens ( i ) also interact with other netizens ( j ) ."
"when netizen i communicates a given incident to netizen j , then j will react in one of two ways :","where x i ( t ) is the netizens ' credibility , y i ( t ) represents the rate of dissemination , z i ( t ) is the netizens ' desire to disseminate information , c i ( t ) is the intensity of communication , and + + = a a a ."

"by using graphs and matrices to measure density and centrality in social network data , researchers can depict the overall shape of the network in terms of a hierarchy , which identifies the center of the network and influential people to determine how change happens over time .","the key to sna is to identify and measure the relationships between actors to capture the interactions between people ( yousefi - nooraie , dobbins , brouwers , & wakefield , ) ."
density is used to measure the degree of interaction between actors in a social network .,"a density measurement of - 1.0 indicates that there is no connection between actors , while a measurement of means that there is a direct connection between all actors ."
"if an individual ' s median center value is , then he / she does not have the ability to influence the behavior of other individuals and is located at the edge of the network .","if an actor ' s median center value is , then the actor has direct influence over all other actors and is at the center of the network ."
"for a network graph with g objects , the degree of centrality of actor i is measured by the total number of direct contacts between i and other actors ( g ) , as represented by the matrix in eq .","in the undirected binary graph , the behavioral degree measures the extent to which an object in a social network is associated with all other objects ."
"the degree of outwardness indicates the degree to which an object focuses on other objects , whereas the degree of intrinsic centrality indicates the degree to which the object is concerned .",the degree of centrality measures the degree to which an object in a social network is associated with all other objects .
their views eressed during emergencies can often influence the development of public opinions and have a greater impact on network information dissemination .,other nodes are on the outside edges of the network and only play a role in transmitting information rather than influencing opinion .
"we then applied our model to real - life data taken from the list of popular annual events of the "" china online public opinion annual report "" in the "" letter about the internet "" published by the humanities and social sciences research report cultivation project of the ministry of education of the people ' s republic of china and shanghai jiaotong university ' s public opinion research laboratory .","from this list , we selected emergencies with responses that were considerably influenced by public opinion between and ."
this study uses matlab ( r2016b version ) simulation software and the baidu index data of the emergency network public opinion transmissions .,our model is applied to determine the overall effect of network public opinion and the interactions between all three subjects .
"then , five individuals who forwarded or commented on events from each of those five nodes were randomly selected , giving us a * 75 propagation matrix model .",this allowed us to analyze the spatial propagation effect between nodes for each of the emergencies studied .
demonstrates a consistent trend in online public sentiment during an emergency : it grows rapidly for a time and then gradually disappears in a manner consistent with true lyrical spikes and thick tail data .,this indicates that the simulation has high credibility and is consistent with reality .
this means that internet users may be convinced of network rumors and even spread undisclosed information at random .,") and found that when the level of trust remains low , netizens have a strong desire for information dissemination and seriously overestimate information , resulting in a state of "" high weight . """
"when netizens are in a semi - closed state , it is easier to spread unproven information at random and in a limited rational situation , thus accelerating the speed of transmission of public opinion across the network .","because of the openness and freedom of network media , opinion leaders exist who have a larger influence and can attract more attention ; these leaders play an important role in mediating public opinion communication ."
"the sooner the government releases information , the higher the rate of acceptance by the media and netizens .",increased government guidance releases positive signals to netizens and the media and makes it easier to control information .
the highest density for accidents and social security events is about 2 higher than for natural disasters and public health events .,"in other words , accidents and social security events are more likely to attract the attention of netizens and elicit public opinion ."
"however , even today , the density of all emergencies is very low , indicating that communication between users about emergencies remains low , and the dissemination of information is still slow .","this may be because microblogs are mostly used for entertainment ; user participation behavior is relatively random , unlike that of communication subjects with limited information dissemination capabilities ."
"at the beginning of an emergency , mainstream media play a crucial role in rapid reporting of real information on an emergency , especially accidents and social security incidents .","in the early stages of public sentiment evolution , the influence of the media is insufficient , and it is , therefore , necessary for the government to give relevant information to the public ."
media are one of the main actors in an emergency and connect the government and the public .,"on the one hand , the media should pursue their own value standards : to report incidents fairly and truthfully and to communicate real - time information on emergencies ."
this allows the public to quickly determine the evolution of emergencies and guide the trend of online public sentiment .,"on the other hand , strengthening the media ' s relationship with the government can allow the media to report on government decisions and plans for responding to emergencies to the public in real - time ."
"through online rumors , netizens ' distrust of the government ferments , eventually triggering an online public opinion event .","in the era of big data , the government must handle public opinion incidents quickly , promptly , and efficiently in order to fulfill the public ' s need to receive information promptly ."
the most important measure for the government to effectively control and guide online public sentiment is to build credibility .,"the speed and transparency of the government ' s disclosure of emergency information is another key factor : the faster the government discloses information , the greater its transparency and credibility , and the more likely it is to calm rumors and foster the steady evolution of public opinion ."
the key to improving government credibility is to eliminate netizens ' misjudgment and curb excessive grievances .,"therefore , the government must establish a rational target system and adopt positive governance measures to form an effective mechanism to guide the dissemination of relevant information ."
this is done to illuminate the evolution of public opinion and the effects of governance over time .,"first , a multi - agent modeling and simulation method is used to simulate interactions between netizens and netizens , between the media and netizens , and between the media and government ."
the accuracy and depth of the research need to be improved .,"the funder had no role either in the study design , collection , analysis , and the writing of the report or in the decision to submit the article for publication ."
"highlighted are tactics to improve fusion efficiency and production of antibodies in vitro , the use of chemically defined culture media , and attempts at generating antibodies other than murine , especially human .",some of the procedures surveyed are not yet routinely applied but are promising .
"these trends should be carefully considered before making basic decisions , for example what cell line to use as a fusion partner .",beginners in hybridoma technology and those planning to use it soon should be aware of current trends beyond the classical technology .
"much has also been learned about the structure and genetics of antibodies by studies with homogeneous populations of these molecules ( teillaud et al . , ; depinho et al . , ) .",in more recent years the use of monoclonal antibodies in clinical procedures has increased .
"therapeutic applications , while still in trial stages for the most part , are encouraging and offer the hope of new , more effective treatments for many disorders .","in the area of diagnostic testing , monoclonals can be selected to produce reagents with the desired specificities , thus yielding more reliable resuits ."
the desired cells were recovered from the host by dissociating the spleen or other lymphatic tissues .,"this procedure has obvious limitations for studies with substances which are not immunogenic in an animal host ( e . g . , macromolecules normally found in the host ) or which cannot , for ethical reasons , be used to immunize humans ."
"applications of these procedures have been somewhat limited , but are becoming more common as the need for alternatives to in vivo immunization becomes clearer .","as the study of interactions which occur when a resting b lymphocyte is transformed into a secreting cell have advanced , progress has been made toward developing in vitro immunization procedures ."
similar investigations with human monoclonal antibodies have been hindered by the lack of a suitable human myeloma fusion partner .,"for the most part , b lymphocytes were derived from immunized mice ( very often balb / c ) to produce mouse mouse hybrids ."
"volumes up to several liters can be readily obtained , but special eertise is required to operate these systems .","several new strategies are available to immobilize the hybrid cells while the supernatant , which contains monoclonal antibodies , is collected ."
"potential contamination of cell lines , particularly with mycoplasma , is of serious concern when cultivating hybridomas in vitro .","mycoplasmas have been shown to alter immunoglobulin synthesis ( hendershot and levitt , ) ."
"those who seek more information on how to generate hybridomas should consult articles detailing that technology ( oi and herzenberg , ; galfr6 and milstein , ; kshler , ; bastin et al . , ; lane et al . , ; nakamura et al . , ; campbell , ; goding , ) .","readers who seek more comprehensive information on current hybridoma technology and monoclonal antibody applications are encouraged to examine any of a number of excellent reviews ( milstein , ; reading , ; denis et al . , ; schonherr and houwink , ; sikora , ; kshler , ; westerwoudt , ; depinho et al . , ) ."
since the early days of cell culture the necessity for serum supplements has been acknowledged .,"cole et al . , ; , darfler and insel , ; , kovar and franek , ; , cleveland et al . , ; , kawamoto et al . , ; , mchugh et al . , ; , steimer , . c efforts to reduce the dependence upon such supplements have had various degrees of success ."
with the advent of hybridoma technology has come a renewed interest in chemically defined media .,"many of the reasons are the same as those which have motivated cell culturists , especially the need to eliminate the variations in serum composition between vendors and between lots from the same vendor , to supplement the culture medium with only those components which enhance cell growth , to decrease the probability of introducing contaminants such as viruses and mycoplasma , and to reduce the costs of large - scale operations ."
"other concerns specific to the production of monoclonal antibodies from hybridomas include the time and effort required to purify the antibod - ies from the medium , the risk of introducing components which may inhibit b lymphocyte function before and after hybridization , and the possibility of cross - reactions between the monoclonal antibodies being produced and components in the medium .",this last problem is of particular concern in the production of antibodies against compounds which naturally occur in animals and humans such as hormones and enzymes .
"according to the supplier , this line can be used either with balb / c mice in a traditional hat selection system or with rbf / dn mice in an aat selection system .",the hl - 1 friendly myeloma - 653 is relatively new and is quite similar to fox - ny .
a similar requirement for a macrophage - derived factor to support the in vitro growth of plasmacytoma cells was also reported by nordan and potter .,recently isolated a t cell - derived lymphokine which was found to be necessary for in vitro cultivation of most of their rat mouse hybrids .
"similar efforts have been made to produce nonsecreting hybrid fusion partners from murine myelomas and human cells ( ostberg and pursh , ; teng et al . , ) .","additional cell lines of this type are being developed which have high fusion efficiencies and maintain antibody production for more than year ( posner , personal communications ) ."
all cell lines now being used rely on a defect in the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase salvage pathway .,"some increase in the number of antibody - secreting hybrids has been obtained by substituting azaserine for aminopterin ( edwards et al . , ; buck et al . , ) or by adding ouabain ( kozbor et al . , ; ) ."
in rodent systems immune lymphocytes can usually be generated by injecting a host with the desired antigens .,"after sufficient time and proper boosting to enhance the response , the spleens of these animals will contain antibody - secreting b lymphocytes ."
"in some cases however , the immunogenicity of a particular determinant is low .",essentially three strategies have been developed to improve the response to weak antigens or to a minor determinant of a complex immunogen and thus increase the number of relevant b lymphocytes .
"splenocytes harvested from an immunized donor can be reinjected , along with antigen , into a syngeneic , irradiated recipient .",the spleen cells of the second host are harvested for fusion with the myeloma partner .
"this selective reduction of response can be achieved either by injecting a cytotoxic agent , such as cyclophosphamide , with the immunogen ( matthew and patterson , ) or by passively immunizing the recipient with antibodies directed toward the undesired determinants ( thalhamer and freund , ) .",an enhanced response against a particular determinant in a mixture can also be developed in animals by depressing the response toward determinants which are not of interest .
"due to ethical considerations , immune human b lymphocytes cannot be prepared as in animal systems .","many antigens of interest cannot be used to immunize patients ; and even in those cases where immunization is acceptable , the primary source of antibody - secreting b lymphocytes is most frequently peripheral blood ."
"extensive reviews of in vitro immunization are available ( reading , ; borrebaeck , ) .","this procedure often requires complex media and additives , such as dextran sulfate , to enhance the response of the pbls ( schelling , ) , or thymocyte - conditioned medium to improve the response of murine spleen cells ( takahashi et al . , ) ."
"incubation of pbl with activators such as pokeweed mitogen ( denis et al . , ) has been helpful in some instances to stimulate quiescent b cells prior to fusion .",mitogen - activated b lymphocytes have been used for hybridization in animal model systems .
"objections have been raised to the use of peg because of its toxicity to the cells , and alternatives have been suggested .","lymphocytes to myeloma partners ( kt ~ hler et al . , ) , but in later years polyethylene glycol ( peg ) has been used instead of the virus ."
immunochemical methods have been applied to fusion mixtures in an effort to guide the immune lymphocytes to the myeloma cells .,"the latter cells are coated with antigen ( kranz et al . , ) or haptens ( lo et al . , ) and then reacted with immune lymphocytes with or without peg ( bankert et al . , ) ."
"peritoneal macrophages ( fazekas de st . groth and scheidegger , ) , splenocytes ( goding , ) , or thymocytes ( oi and herzenberg , ) are employed to provide unknown factors which enhance the growth of the hybrid cells .",feeder cell layers are routinely used in hybridoma technology to support the growth of newly fused hybrids and single ceils during cloning .
have reported the isolation of a t - cell derived lymphokine which supports the in vitro growth of rat mouse hybrids which otherwise failed to survive .,continued investigations along these lines should lead to the development of well defined additives .
"for some mouse mouse hybridomas the use of pristane can be eliminated without deminishing the concentrations of antibodies recovered ( macario and dugan , unpublished data ) .","murine hosts for the hybridomas are most often balb / c and are prepared by a single intraperitoneal injection of pristane ( 2,6 , 10,14 - tetramethylpentadecane ) ."
one problem with in vivo generation is host rejection of the hybridoma .,"with the increasing need for large quantities of nonmurine antibodies , elaborate methods have been developed to prepare the host and the hybridomas ( table v ) ."
"; kozbor et al . , ) or by growth in liver tissue ( hirsch et al . , ) has proved useful for establishing hybridomas in vivo and for stabilizing the secretion of antibodies in ascitic tumors .","even when the difficulties of producing monoclonal antibodies in ascitic fluid can be resolved , purity may remain a problem ."
"potential parameters for modification include gas exchange , mechanical forces acting on the cells ( fluid dynamics ) , rates of nutrient consumption , means for regulating feeding , waste product accumulation and effects on cell growth and secretion , and the effects of temperature and pressure ( feder and tolbert , ; glacken et al . , ; gruenberg and walker , ; birch et al . , ; reuveny et al . , a , b ) .",the current availability of low - serum and serum - free media ( discussed above ) makes optimization of the cultivation systems feasible .
small - scale production includes systems such as stationary culture flasks and roller bottle techniques .,"these are readily available in laboratories which do tissue culture and are effective for producing small quantities ( < liter ) of antibodycontaining media from several clones simultaneously ( garberi et al . , ) ."
"control of these units is becoming very sophisticated ( wernerspach , ) .","also included in this category are the smaller airlift fermentors and stirred culture systems , which are being developed for bench - top operation ."
such interspecies hybrids are often plagued by instability resulting from chromosomal incompatibility .,"to avoid some of these problems encountered with the human fusion partners , some investigators have produced heterologous hybrids by using the well established murine fusion partners ( table vii ) ."
"such hybrid fusion partners require considerable time to generate , but they appear to produce stable hybridomas with slightly higher secretion rates than nonhybridized murine myelomas .","whether the use of murine fusion partners to produce human x mouse hybrids favors the development of more igg - secreting clones cannot be determined , since most publications report the screening of hybridization products for only a single class of antibodies ."

the production of hybridomas secreting primate monoclonal antibodies may also have important clinical applications .,immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies of murine origin tends to elicite an immune response against the therapeutic agent .
"a model of canine - to - murine xenotransplantation was used to quantitatively compare canine muscle cell engraftment , and determine if engrafted donor cells could function as satellite cells in vivo .","we show that delta - 1 ext - igg inhibited differentiation of canine muscle - derived cells , and increased the level of genes normally eressed in myogenic precursors ."
transplantation of myogenic stem cells possesses great potential for longterm repair of dystrophic muscle .,"duchenne muscular dystrophy ( dmd ) , the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy , is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene , the largest gene identified in the human genome ."
traditional means of eanding satellite cell - derived myoblasts ex vivo results in a dramatic loss of engraftment potential . the success of single muscle fiber transplantation suggests that mimicking the biochemical and biophysical signaling from the fiber may be important for maintaining engraftment potential of eanded muscle satellite cells .,"however , multiple muscle groups within the body will need to be targeted , and a single donor muscle biopsy is unlikely to provide enough cells to effectively transplant the muscle mass of a patient affected by muscular dystrophy ."
we show that activation of notch signaling during eansion of canine muscle - derived cells inhibited myogenic differentiation .,"furthermore , canine - to - mouse xenotransplantation demonstrated that activation of notch signaling during donor cell eansion maintained engraftment potential ."

three more even numbered slides were chosen from the region of highest engraftment and stained for canine dystrophin and lamin a / c .,"initially , slides , , and were stained for dystrophin and lamin a / c to determine the region of highest engraftment ."
"sections were incubated in blocking buffer ( 2% goat serum , % bsa , % cold fish skin gelatin , 5% sodium azide , x pbs ) for hour at room temperature , followed by primary antibody diluted in primary antibody dilution buffer ( 1% bsa , % cold fish skin gelatin , 5% sodium azide , x pbs ) for hour at room temperature , or overnight at c .","for dystrophin and lamin a / c staining , the sections were fixed in acetone at c for minutes , allowed to dry , and rehydrated in pbs ."

the images for each field of view were stitched together to form an entire cross - sectional view .,"the number of fibers eressing canine dystrophin , the number of nuclei eressing canine lamin a / c , and the number of nuclei eressing canine lamin a / c and pax7 were counted from these cross - sectional views ."
the mouse hindlimb was pre - irradiated with gy of ionizing radiation to prevent regeneration by host mouse satellite cells and pre - treated with bacl to induce muscle degeneration ( see methods ) .,"on average , injection of , 000 freshly isolated canine musclederived cells appeared to be equivalent to injection of single canine muscle fibers from the same donor muscle biopsy , comparing both the number of fibers eressing canine dystrophin and the number of nuclei eressing pax7 and canine lamin a / c ( figure a , b ) ."
"despite the superior potential , muscle fiber preparations are not likely to yield enough transplantable material to treat all muscles of an individual affected with muscular dystrophy .","therefore , to achieve sufficient numbers of donor cells for large scale transplantation , ex vivo eansion will be required ."
"therefore , the difference in the level of engraftment observed between figure a and c likely reflects how each donor ' s muscle - derived cell population has a different capacity for reconstitution .","moreover , the freshly isolated cells transplanted for the eeriment in figure a remained on ice for a longer period of time before transplant to accommodate the muscle fiber preparation , which may have had a negative impact on engraftment ."
"based on studies of the in vitro eansion of hematopoietic stem cells , we hypothesized that activating notch signaling in musclederived cells during eansion would maintain engraftment potential of donor cells .","yet , these results are consistent with previous studies showing that eanding myoblasts in vitro diminishes transplantation efficiency ."
"similarly , eure of freshly isolated canine muscle - derived cells to delta - 1 ext - igg inhibited differentiation ( figure b ) , and resulted in a - to - fold eansion of total cell number over days ( supplemental table ) .","increased eression of hey1 , heyl , and dtx4 confirmed activation of notch signaling in cells eed to delta - 1 ext - igg ( figure a ) ."
"this was accompanied by a significant decrease in eression of myod , and an increase in eression of myf5 and pax7 in cells eanded on delta - 1 ext - igg ( figure b ) .","eression of myogenin was almost undetectable in cells grown on human igg , but completely absent from cells grown on delta - 1 ext - igg ( data not shown ) , confirming immunocytochemistry results ( see figure ) ."
"together , these data show that culture of primary musclederived cells on delta - 1 ext - igg promotes the eansion of pax7 and myf5 positive cells with enhanced cxcr4 eression .","in contrast , the cxcr4 receptor , which has a critical role in muscle regeneration , showed increased rna and protein levels in cells eanded on delta - 1 ext - igg ( figure c and a ) , however , the percentage of cxcr4 eressing cells did not increase ( table ) , indicating a higher abundance of cxcr4 per cell ."
"engraftment of cells eanded on delta - 1 ext - igg was similar to engraftment of freshly isolated cells , as shown by the similar number of fibers eressing canine dystrophin , nuclei eressing canine lamin a / c , and nuclei eressing canine lamin a / c and pax7 ( figure a - c ) .","approximately % of cells eanded on delta - 1 ext - igg are myogenic cells , as evidenced by syndecan eression ( table ) , whereas , less than % of freshly isolated cells generate myogenic cell clones in culture ( data not shown ) ."
"for muscle injected with cells eanded on human igg , the ratio of the number of canine lamin a / c - positive nuclei to the number of canine dystrophin - positive fibers per cross - section was ; however , the ratio is for muscle injected with cells eanded on delta - 1 ext - igg , and for muscle injected with fresh cells .","the enhanced muscle regeneration capacity of muscle cells eanded on the notch ligand was largely due to enhanced myogenesis rather than simple cell survival , based on the ratio of donor lamin a / c + cells to donor myofibers ( figure e ) ."
"to determine whether the engrafted donor muscle cells are capable of regeneration , mice were subjected to two additional rounds of intramuscular bacl injection at and weeks after donor cell transplant .","as noted above , the initial hindlimb irradiation prior to the donor cell transplantation prevents muscle regeneration from the host mouse satellite cells and the majority of muscle repair will require donor canine satellite cell activity ."
"four weeks following two additional rounds of bacl - induced regeneration , muscle injected with delta - 1 ext - igg eanded cells showed a significant increase in the number of fibers eressing canine dystrophin and a consistent number of nuclei co - eressing pax7 and canine lamin a / c ( figure a - c ) .","eression of a developmental form of myosin heavy chain ( devmyhc ) , eressed in immature myofibers , indicated ongoing muscle regeneration ( figure d and e ) ."
"nuclei co - eressing pax7 and canine lamin a / c were detected in two recipients ( figure h , i ) .","however , there was no statistically significant difference in the level of engraftment between secondary recipients of fresh cells and delta - 1 ext - igg eanded cells ."
the ability of single muscle fibers to engraft more effectively than mononuclear cell preparations suggests that association of the satellite cell with the fiber preserves the ability of the satellite cell to participate in muscle repair .,"in mouse studies , physical trituration of the fibers to disrupt satellite cell - fiber interactions yields cells with significantly greater engraftment potential than cells enzymatically removed from the fiber ."
activation of notch signaling is required for satellite cell proliferation and muscle regeneration after injury .,"new evidence indicates that notch activity also plays an important role in maintenance of the satellite cell population after injury , and that eression of notch target genes is associated with quiescent satellite cells that eress high levels of pax7 ."
"myf5 is not eressed during myogenic differentiation , and myf5 transcripts have been detected in quiescent and newly activated satellite cells .",increased eression of myf5 indicates that induction of notch signaling with delta - 1 ext - igg during in vitro culture of the canine muscle - derived cells resulted in maintenance and eansion of a myogenic cell with characteristics of an early activated satellite cell .
"in contrast , promoting cxcr4 activity by inhibiting cd26 / dpp - iv degradation of sdf - 1 with diprotin a enhances donor cell engraftment .",blocking cxcr4 receptor activity on donor cells before transplant significantly impairs donor cell engraftment .
"together , this indicates that donor cells eanded on delta - 1 ext - igg that had engrafted into recipient muscle participated in muscle repair similar to satellite cells , and had the capacity to self - renew , similar to longterm repopulating hematopoietic cells .","moreover , engraftment was detected in secondary recipients of delta - 1 ext - igg eanded cells ."
"similarly , immobilized delta - 1 ext - igg inhibits differentiation of human cd34 + cd38 cord blood precursors , and dramatically increases the number of precursors capable of repopulating nod / scid mice .","a phase clinical trial of transplantation of ex vivo eanded cd34 + cd38 - cord blood precursors is currently underway in patients with high risk leukemias , and appears to successfully promote donor cell engraftment ."
"therefore , we will translate these results to human muscle derived cells and compare engraftment potential using human - to - mouse xenotransplantation .","importantly , cells eanded in the presence of notch activation maintain engraftment potential , indicating the potential for therapeutic benefit ."
the bars represent the average eression level relative to timm17b sd ( n ) .,a student ' s t - test was used to determine statistical significance (* p < 0.05 ; * * p < 0.01 ) .
"cryosections from mouse muscle injected with or freshly isolated mixed canine muscle - derived mononuclear cells , cells eanded on delta - 1 ext - igg , or cells eanded on human igg , were immunostained with anti - dystrophin , anti - lamin a / c , and / or anti - pax7 antibodies and fluorescently labeled secondary antibody .","the resulting histograms are vertically offset , and scaled to avoid overlap ."
"herein , we generated three distinct dna constructs in the eukaryotic eression plasmid pvax1 ; one encoding the s protein [ pvax1 - ( pedv - s ) ] , the second encoding the n - terminal fragment ( s1 ) [ pvax1 - ( pedv - s1 ) ] containing potent antigenic sites , and the third eressing the porcine interleukin - 18 ( pil - 18 ) [ pvax1 - ( il - 18 ) ] .",the spike ( s ) protein is one of the main structural proteins of pedv capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies in vivo .

the results showed that ctl function in the peripheral blood of the mice treated with pvax1 - ( pedv - s1 ) in combination with pvax1 - ( il - 18 ) was significantly higher than that observed with pvax1 - ( pedv - s1 ) alone ( p < 1 ) .,"however , as with other studies , these values were mirrored by the additive effects of pvax1 - ( pedv - s1 ) and pvax1 - ( il - 18 ) given separately ."
"for this reason , we evaluated synergistic effects between the pedv - s1 and pil - 18 by means of dna vaccination .",preliminary eeriments demonstrated via immunofluorescence assays that the cloned and transiently transfected s and s1 genes along with the pil - 18 gene were indeed capable of eressing the protein constructs in bhk - 21 mouse cells .
changes in the serum igg levels in particular between and dpi clearly showed that the plasmid constructs induced effective humoral responses capable of neutralizing the virus and that this neutralizing effect was strongest for the full - length s protein .,"however , uneectedly , functioned only in tandem with pvax1 - ( pedv - s1 ) to affect both proliferative and virus neutralizing responses but exerted no adjuvant effects ."
"it is well accepted that following polarization , th1 cells secret ifn - and il - 2 that mediate cellular immune responses , and th2 cells secret il - 4 and il - 10 that help facilitate humoral immune responses where ifn - and il - 4 levels are inversely regulated .","in the studies presented herein , the levels of ifn - were significantly elevated in all non - control treatment groups ."
future studies will examine this phenomenon more closely while investigating additional cytokines that enhance antibody production rather than th1 type cytokines before attempting to transfer this technology to studies in swine .,"in contrast to our work on tegv ( ren et al . , ) , results presented here showed that the full - length s gene unilaterally induced a better immune response than the truncated form of the protein ; however , this may result from poor protein folding or less than optimal presentation of the shortened form to the host immune system ."

titers of infectious virus contained in the original culture supernatants and purified stocks were determined by plaque assay ( see below ) .,"after h centrifugation at 00 rpm ( sw32 ti rotor ; optima le - 8 0 k ultracentrifuge , beckman ) at c , the virus - containing pellet was resuspended in nte buffer , aliquoted and stored at c until further use ."
"four days post - infection , cells were fixed for h at room temperature with formaldehyde directly added to the medium to a final concentration of %.",fixed cells were washed extensively with water before being stained with a solution containing % crystal violet and % ethanol for min .
"reactions were performed on an cfx96 ( bio - rad ) using the following program : c for min and cycles as follows : c for s , c for s . gapdh mrna was used for normalization of input rna .",cdna was generated using the high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit ( applied biosystems ) and two - steps rt - qpcr was performed using the itaq universal sybr green x mix ( bio - rad ) and the following primers : gapdh_forward ' - gaaggtgaaggtcggagtc - 3 ' and gapdh_reverse ' - gaagatggtgatgggatttc - 3 ' ; zikv_forward ' - agatgaactgattggccgggc - 3 ' and zikv_reverse ' - aggtctcttctgtggaaata - 3 ' .
"after h blocking with blocking buffer , immunostaining was performed using primary antibodies as described above .",the following secondary antibodies were used : goat anti - mouse aberrior star580 and goat anti - rabbit aberrior star red ( abberior instruments gmbh ) .
the theoretical confocal and sted psf were calculated based on the metadata of the acquired image in combination with the refractive index for mowiol as embedding medium .,deconvolution of confocal and sted images was carried out using the huygens professional deconvolution software ( scientific volume imaging ) .
cells were rinsed twice with mm glycine in m phem and washed twice for min with the same buffer .,"finally , cells were rinsed ten times with m phem buffer before being subjected to light microscopy ."
sixty observation fields were defined and image acquisition was performed at intervals of min for h by using the automated nikon perfect focus system and gfp filter .,"pictures were analyzed with the nikon nis element advanced research program and processed by using the imagej software package fiji ( schindelin et al . , ) ."
statistical analysis was performed as indicated in the text and figure legends .,"to determine p - values , two - tailed distribution student s t test was calculated using the graphpad prism v6 software ."
"in recent years , rnai has become a widely used approach for studying gene function by targeted cleavage of a specific rna .","moreover , the technology has been developed as a new therapeutic option that has already made its way into clinical testing ."
rnai holds great promise to provide a flexible approach that can rapidly be adapted to new viral target sequences .,treatment of viral infections remains a serious challenge due to the emergence of new viruses and strain variation among known virus species .
"well - known viruses , like the h1n1 / 09 influenza virus , cause pandemics of global dimensions .","thus , there is a pressing unmet medical need to develop new antiviral drugs ."
"among the various oligonucleotide - based strategies , rna interference ( rnai ) is widely regarded as a particularly powerful technology .",rnai is a posttranscriptional gene silencing mechanism that is triggered by double - stranded rna .
silencing of endogenously eressed genes has become a routine procedure and predesigned or validated sirnas with silencing guarantee against virtually any human or murine gene are commercially available .,"in contrast , the design of sirnas with high antiviral activity still remains a challenging task ."
"more recently , however , a design algorithm was developed for the selection of sirna with particularly high potency and specificity , which not only focuses on the design of the sirna , but also takes into consideration the secondary structures of the sirna and their target site .",most of the publically available tools for the design of sirnas exclusively optimize the base composition of the sirna .
"unfortunately , simply directing sirnas to protein coding regions is insufficient , since silent mutations can cause the sirnas to lose their inhibitory potential .",target regions with an important function in the structure of the rna may prove to be a better choice to avoid viral escape .
"based on the eerience in the antisense field , numerous modified nucleotides have been assessed for their applicability to enhance the stability of sirnas against nucleases .","phosphorothioates , nucleotides with modifications at the position ( e . g . , - o - methyl - rna and - fluoro - nucleotides ) , as well as locked nucleic acids are among the most widely employed building blocks for rnai applications ."
"in general , choose the best sirnas obtained with a design tool .","if the sirna design tool did not include a blast option , an ncbi blast should follow ( see note ) ."
a summary of potential folding results is given in a new window ( see note ) .,exclude all sirnas whose antisense strand is predicted to form secondary structures indicated by at least one structure with a negative dg value .
"the procedure consists of two steps : first , folding of the entire target rna molecule and , second , the determination of the change in gibbs free energy ( dg ) of the local rna target site .",the accessibility of the target rna sequence will be considered in the third major step of sirna design .
this temperature can be modified by using the rna mfold version server .,"the "" upper bond on the number of computing folding "" can be limited to or less for long sequences as they may increase the computational load and resulting response time ."
( e ) sequences shorter than bases can be folded immediately ( as of march ) .,"for longer rna sequences up to , 000 bases , select batch and enter your e - mail address ."
"additionally , limit the "" upper bond on the number of computing folding "" to .","parameters in this window can be set according to the mfold version described above , except the folding temperature , which is not fixed at c ."
"( g ) dg is calculated for a number of potential secondary structures ( listed as "" structure , , "" beneath "" view individual structures "" ) .","the more negative dg , the more stable secondary structure is going to be , which also indicate a higher chance of its presence in a biological system ."
( i ) find the corresponding sirna target site and determine all bases within the target site that are involved in forming a secondary structure .,"add also bases or base pairs which are part of the close neighborhood , for example bases that form loops , even if these are not part of the sirna target site ."
( iii ) find the corresponding bases ( marked by numbers ) and add all single dg values of involved bases .,energies of helices and loops have to be included if one base of this structure is part of the target site .
"furthermore , accessible target sites are characterized by low dg local values .",exclude all sirnas whose target structure showed strong variability based on at least ten folded structures ( different target structures ) .
the virus target sequence is cloned upstream or downstream of a gfp or luciferase reporter and is then cotransfected with the selected sirnas .,reporter assays are the method of choice to verify the efficiency of the selected sirnas .
the virus target sequence is cloned in the untranslated region ( 3 - utr ) of the renilla luciferase gene .,the dual - luciferase reporter assay is a method to measure the activity of both firefly and renilla luciferases in one sample .
the transfection efficiency into other cell lines can be tested by transfection of a random sirna that is labeled with cy3 at the end of the sirna sense strand ( sirna can be transfected with or without a reporter plasmid ) .,"as an example , a protocol for transient transfection of hela cells in - well plates using lipofectamine transfection reagent will be described ( see note ) ."
these results should be confirmed by western blot analysis as described in subheading .,"in the case of psicheck - 2 cotransfection , both renilla and firefly luciferases will be measured ( see subheading ) ."
select efficient sirnas for the following functional analysis in virus assay .,highly potent antiviral sirnas reduce the gfp eression virtually to completion ( western blot ) or show at least % inhibition of renilla luciferase ( dual - luciferase reporter assay ) .
"virus dilutions can be stored at c for several minutes , if necessary .",incubate at c for min before adding to the cells .
"in practice , sirna modifications are often accompanied by decreased silencing efficiency compared to the unmodified sirna .","lna modifications introduced at any position except , , , and in the antisense strand do not cause substantial loss of silencing efficiency ."
one of the main challenges will then be efficient delivery of the sirna to the desired target tissue .,the following chapters describe virusbased approaches to deliver shrna eression cassettes as well as different strategies for the application of chemically presynthesized sirnas .
"in order to identify conserved regions in the viral genome , it is advisable to select sequences of various strains and perform a blast search .",regions with high homology can be considered conserved and represent suitable sirna target sites .
"for long virus target sequences , use a polymerase with proofreading activity .","since the amplified sequences will lack a - overhangs , which are essential for the described cloning method , additional incubation with taq polymerase is necessary ."
vector maps and sequences of pcdna3 . 1 / ct - gfp - topo and pcdna3 . 1 / nt - gfp - topo are available on the invitrogen website ( see table ) .,vector map and sequence of psicheck - 2 is available on the promega website ( see table ) .
"in this case , customize the additional bases for efficient restriction and the incubation time .",an extensive table is provided by new england biolabs ( see table ) .
"although fish oil - fed mice had lower lung inflammation compared with controls , fish oil feeding also resulted in a % higher mortality rate , a % higher lung viral load at d post infection , and a prolonged recovery period following infection .","male c57bl / 6 mice fed either a menhaden fish oil / corn oil diet ( 4 g fish oil : 1 g corn oil , wt : wt at g / 100 g diet ) or a control corn oil diet were infected with influenza a / puertorico / 8 / 34 and analyzed for lung pathology and immune function ."
"in addition , decreases in ex vivo production of tumor necrosis factor - a ( tnfa ) , interleukin ( il ) - 1 , il - 2 , il - 6 , and interferon ( ifn ) - g have also been reported ( 10 , .","studies of rodents fed fish oil - enriched diets have shown a reduction in natural killer ( nk ) cell activity , decreased lymphocyte proliferation , and decreased antigen presentation functions ( 9 , ."
"for example , diets supplemented with fish oils have been shown to lower host resistance to mycobacterium tuberculosis , to reduce the survival of mice against infection with listeria monocytogenes , and to decrease resistance of mice infected with salmonella typhimurium .","whereas the antiinflammatory properties of pufa may be beneficial for some chronic inflammatory illnesses , these same antiinflammatory properties may be detrimental for response to an infection when an intact immune system is needed to eradicate an invading pathogen ."
"whereas this inflammatory response is necessary for viral clearance , it also contributes to lung pathology .","although there are many studies documenting the antiinflammatory properties of fish oil , there are few studies that have examined the effects of fish oil on viral infection ."
"with the anticipated increase of fish consumption and the increase in the usage of fish oil supplements , there is a growing concern that the beneficial antiinflammatory properties of ( n - 3 ) fatty acids may have adverse effects when inflammation is necessary to combat infection .","additionally , in , % of the u . s . population reported using fish oil or fish oil supplements for health reasons ."
all mice were housed under a - hlight / - dark schedule with free access to food and water .,animals were maintained under protocols approved by the institutional animal care and use committee .
mice were weighed daily following infection and percent weight loss compared with starting weight at time of infection was calculated .,previous studies from our laboratory determined that this dose of virus is sufficient to effectively elicit an immune response with normal mortality in mice .
"and perfused with % paraformaldehyde , paraffin embedded , cut in - mm sections , and stained with hematoxylin and eosin .","the left lobe of the lung was removed at d ( uninfected mice ) , , , , and p . i ."
virus titers were determined based on the presence or absence of hemagglutination of human o rbc and tcid was determined by the method of reed and muench .,"briefly , supernates from lung homogenates were serially diluted and used to infect madin - darby canine kidney cells ."
fluorescence was measured using a facscalibur flow cytometer ( becton dickinson ) equipped with a - nm argon laser and a - nm diode laser .,cell numbers between different samples were equalized to cells / sample and stained with fluorescein anti - 5 isothiocyanate ( fitc ) and anti - cd3 phycoerythrin ( pe ) ( bd pharmingen ) .
"following previously described methods , mrna levels were measured for tnfa , il - 2 , il - 6 , il - 12 , ifna and ifnb , regulated upon activation , normal t cell eressed and secreted , macrophage inflammatory protein - 1 - a ( mip - 1 a ) , and glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase using quantitative real - time pcr .",all data were eressed as fold - change from uninfected mice fed the same diet .
statistical analyses were performed using jmp statistical software and sas software .,normally distributed data were analyzed by - way anova with diet and day p . i .
"in mice , weight loss is a marker for illness severity following influenza infection and subsequent weight gain is an indicator for recovery .",both control and fish oil - fed mice lost considerable amounts of weight during the course of infection .
increased severity of infection in the fish oil - fed mice was also reflected in the mortality rates .,fish oil feeding results in a higher mortality rate following influenza infection .
recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection is an essential early component of the immune response to influenza infection .,"in the lungs of fish oil - fed uninfected mice ( d ) , the total number of neutrophils was % lower than in control mice ( fig ."
this reduction in cd3 + t lymphocytes was due to fewer c + t cells ( fig .,"b ) , as the number of cd4 + t cells did not differ between groups at any time point ( data not shown ) ."
the favorable effects of dietary fish oils stem from the potential of ( n - 3 ) fatty acids to reduce excessive inflammation .,"studies have shown beneficial antiinflammatory properties of dietary fish oils on chronic diseases such as rheumatoid and osteoarthritis , inflammatory bowel disease , cardiovascular disease , type diabetes , and alzheimer ' s disease ."
"thus , in the case of influenza virus infection , reduced lung inflammation was associated with a poor outcome p . i .","to understand the direct effect of fish oil feeding on the immune response to influenza virus infection , numbers and phenotypes of cells infiltrating the lung tissue were measured ."
"neutrophil migration is controlled in part by the release of chemokines , cytokines , and leukotrienes .","mip - 1 a has been shown to play a critical role in each aspect of neutrophil trafficking , including rolling , stationary adhesion , and tissue recruitment in vivo ."
"cd4 + t cells , on the other hand , help to resolve inflammation during influenza infection ; however , they are not essential for viral clearance .","in mice that lack c + t cells , infection with influenza a / pr / 8 / 34 led to increased viral replication and mortality ."
alternatives to trafficking include increased apoptosis and / or failure to proliferate in response to antigen stimuli .,"however , we examined lung tissue for increased apoptosis by tunel staining and found no differences in apoptosis between diet groups ( data not shown ) ."
our results suggest that chemokines and perhaps their receptor eression may play a key role in the immunomodulatory effects of fish oil during influenza infection .,"interestingly , mrna for mip - 1 a , the ligand for ccr5 , was undereressed in the fish oil - fed mice ."
"for example , studies of fish oil - fed mice have demonstrated that injection with lipopolysaccharide decreased the ex vivo production of tnfa , il - 1 b , and il - 6 by peritoneal macrophages and decreased tnfa , il - 1 b , and il - 6 concentrations in circulation .",the potential for ( n - 3 ) fatty acids to reduce proinflammatory cytokines has been shown previously .
"we also investigated other possibilities for the high mortality rate of fish oil - fed mice , including impaired liver and / or kidney function , spread of virus to the brain , and increased lung cell apoptosis .",this may be a case of survivor bias and those mice that ultimately died may have had a higher viral titer .
further mechanistic studies are needed to determine how pufa can influence the immune response to influenza infection .,"for example , studies have shown that lipid raft disruptions by ( n - 3 ) fatty acids can affect signaling pathways in t lymphocytes and disrupt immunological synapse formation needed to activate t cells ."
results from our study suggest that fish oil consumption has the potential to increase the severity of an influenza virus infection and perhaps other viral illnesses as well .,"in this study , we utilized both a physiologically relevant concentration of dietary fish oil supplementation and a natural route of administration of a viral pathogen ."
"motif mimicry tolerates mutations , evolves quickly to modify interactions with the host , and enables modular interactions with protein complexes .",host cells cannot easily coordinate changes to conserved motif recognition and binding interfaces under selective pressure to maintain critical signaling pathways .
"molecular mimicry ( see glossary ) is a common and effective strategy , enabling a pathogen to usurp host protein function by resemblance .","molecular mimicry varies over a continuum , from one extreme that includes sequence and structural similarity ( i . e . , orthologs ) of entire proteins , to another extreme of chemical similarity at only a few localized sites , as is the case for short linear motifs ( slims ) ."
"while such functions are generally well intended , some risk also exists for harmful effects .","the ability to transfer genetic components across species , or to introduce such components de novo , enables new functions ."
"viral proteins can modulate immunity in several ways , which include : shutdown of host macromolecular synthesis , inhibiting antigen production or apoptosis , and interference with such processes as antigen presentation by mhc , natural killer ( nk ) cell function , antiviral cytokines , or interferon responses .",each of these processes involves coordination among multiple components in host cells .
"over motifs are known , with , 400 validated instances , and many more motifs may await discovery .","focus on viral motifs may reveal practical utility , to broaden the repertoire of tools available to reprogram molecular function in synthetic biology ."
"by promoting use of standard terms for relationships between concepts , an ontology arranges concepts into a framework that can be updated as knowledge grows .","protein function is captured broadly in such a framework , though the nuanced details of interactions with other molecules are not localized to domains or motifs ."
short linear motif ( slim ) : also known as minimotifs or morfs ( molecular recognition features ) .,"regular eression : a string of characters that concisely represents many alternative sequence variants ; may include wildcards to represent any character , groupings of possible characters , repetition , negation , start and end of sequence , etc ."
"a bridge that links literature reports to go term annotation , viralzone is an online knowledge base that contains ' textbook ' information about viral tanomy , replication , genome organization , and virion structure , and provides links to viral sequence data .","importantly , viralzone staff collaborate with the go consortium to define entries for virus - specific molecular functions ."
"most arrows indicate ' is a ' relations , where the hierarchy is refined by specialization .","blue arrows indicate ' part of ' relations , which relate to the symbiont process as parts to a whole ."
an overview of slim functions may also help to prioritize which are of greatest potential for use or abuse when artificially added to modify protein function .,"understanding the functional roles of slims can help identify related mechanisms or processes , or possibly identify knowledge gaps where slims may be posited but not yet identified ."
"the identification of protein domains led to recognition of slims as compact , small - scale functional modules .","protein domains are used to categorize protein function , and the interpro database aggregates information at this within - protein level ."
"this underscores the prevalent mode of elm motif discovery and annotation does not emphasize host - virus interactions , but rather systems - level interactions within eukaryotic cells .","go term , go : ( ' modulation by virus of host morphology or physiology ' , a synonym of ' virushost interaction ' ) ."
"despite not using the viralzone ontology , elm documents other motif classes with go terms that refer to ' viral ' , ' virus ' , ' immune ' , or ' immunity ' ( table ) .","because the focus is motif function in the host cell context , elm does not directly indicate how viral immune interference results ."
this strong requirement by elm for evidence - based motif classes and instances is not strictly a drawback .,"indeed , the elm creators are very aware that computational analysis alone is error prone and can yield misleading outcomes ."
"reports in the primary literature take a different approach , by marking slims in a protein alignment , which includes orthologues to mark conservation ( e . g . , figure in ) .","resources such as interpro and uniprot are able to perform similar assessments , but give broader , domain - level representations with less functional detail than the slim searches enabled by elm ."
this makes it necessary to filter for the most significant and informative outcomes .,this leads to consideration of in silico ( computational ) methods for slim evaluation .
"there are currently at least eight software packages available to discover new slims and packages ( 25 stand - alone programs or servers and two software suites that consist of multiple tools : slimsuite , which includes ten utilities , and meme , which consists of five tools for slim instance detection ) .","methods for slim discovery can be divided into two broad classes : ( i ) de novo discovery of new slims , and ( ii ) instance prediction to find new occurrences of known slims ."
the development of such corrections and their relative advantages are detailed in .,"an important caveat is that to assume such sequences are independent could yield spurious enrichment of shared patterns , so alignment - free methods need to compensate for evolutionary constraints at the domain level , rather than for full - length homologous proteins ."
"structural information , whether known or predicted , can be used for filtering .",filtering methods control high false positive rates from slim instance detection .
"to attenuate virulence , icp34 . 5 is routinely deleted or inactivated when making hsv - 1 constructs for oncolytic therapy .","both are the same length and share domain structures , and partially share slim compositions ( figure i ) ."
a simple approach to instance prediction is a stand - alone program called shettimotif .,it was used to scan protein sequences from poxviridae genomes ( an average of proteins per poxvirus ) for low - complexity regions and regular eressions defined by prosite .
a motif is considered rare and therefore significantly unlikely to occur by chance if it is present at or below some cutoff frequency .,"developed another approach to instance counting , which involves comparison with a null distribution from permuting primary sequence and testing for presence of the motif in the permuted sequences ."
"while algorithmic approaches seek to identify a broad range of slim types , more specialized resources have emerged to track the distribution of a particular slim in viral proteins .","for example , ilir is a web resource dedicated to detecting lir motif - containing proteins in viruses ."
"using curated text mining analysis and position - specific scoring matrices , ilir analyzed reviewed viral sequences available from uniprot across individual viral species and found that viral sequences contain lir motifs .","while many predicted instances may represent false positives , the enrichment of lir motifs in viral sequences is consistent with viral adaptation to host xenophagy ."
slim modularity may enable easy ways to reprogram protein function with a few localized modifications .,"to realize the potential utility of slims in synthetic biology , more research is needed to eand and integrate our collection of knowledge on viral slims ( see outstanding questions ) ."
"detecting slims in variant sequences may help to identify functional innovation or changes in virulence , in a manner that does not rely strictly on functional assessment at the whole - gene level , to identify how sequence - specific variation may interact with host responses .",this may be particularly useful and important to understand new variants and assess the risk that they may spread and cause harmful effects on human health or agricultural interests .
the simplest case is where a viral slim interacts directly with a host protein to yield an immunomodulated phenotype .,"more elaborate cases are known , such as the multifunctional proteins e1a ( ebv ) , nef ( hiv - 1 ) , and icp34 . 5 ( hsv ) ."
"in this study , a nanoparticleassisted polymerase chain reaction ( nanopcr ) assay targeting the n gene of pedv was developed and the sensitivity and specificity were investigated .","under the optimized conditions for detection of pedv rna , the nanopcr assay was - fold more sensitive than a conventional rt - pcr assay ."
"its etiologic agent , porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( pedv ) belongs to the genus coronavirus of the family coronaviridae , and is an enveloped , single - stranded rna virus .","the viral disease was discovered in the united kingdom in and subsequently reported in many swine - producing countries of europe and asia ( puranaveja et al . , ) ."
"a nanoparticle - assisted polymerase chain reaction ( nanopcr ) assay , however , has not been developed for pedv .","the current methods of detecting pedv include virus isolation , serology , in situ hybridization , reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) , reverse transcription loop - mediated isothermal amplification ( rt - lamp ) , and taqman - based real - time rt - pcr ( hou et al . , ; jung and chae , ; kim and chae , ; kim et al . , ; kusanagi et al . , ; kweon et al . , ; li et al . , ; oh et al . , ; rodak et al . , ; song et al . , ) ."

the results showed that nanopcr was more sensitive than the conventional rt - pcr assay .,no sample ( 0% ) was positive by rt - pcr and negative by nanopcr .
"conventional rt - pcr is less time - consuming but prone to sample contamination occurring during pcr processing steps , which increases the potential for false - positive results .","serology represents the technique used most widely , however , this method has some disadvantages because antibody titers can decrease rapidly after infection ( lager et al . , ) ."
"they can become a public health problem and result in socioeconomic impact because people can become ill and do not go to jobs , schools or handle business which ultimately results in social impact .","some examples are bacteria such as bacillus anthracis ( anthrax - causing bacteria ) and yersinia pestis ( plague - causing specie ) , viruses such as filoviruses ( cause ebola ) , and toxins such as clostridium botulinus ( botulism - causing toxin ) ."
"also , in syria , recently the president bashar al - assad bombed the civilians with chemicals which resulted in huge casualties of children .","recently , ebola virus , bird flu , rota virus , h1n1 , influenza , naegleria , dengue fever , and many other forms of diseases are being spread among those countries where population is not getting controlled such as african and some asian countries ."
"similarly , the category c laboratories should work to identify those agents that can cause potential damage as a bioterrorism agent in future ; they all must act as public health laboratories .",the b category laboratories can help to isolate and identify the exact agent responsible for bioterrorism and work for its remedial measures and design such strategies .
"also , the environment ethics is the subject being ignored the most specifically by the scientists who are engaged in performing eeriments on viruses and bacteria , genetic modifications , etc .","however , problems can still exist because it is not easy to identify the culprit who release or transmit agents because the recipes to spread such kind of terror are easily available and accessible through the internet ."

"in the affected countries , physicians and nurses are under heavy workload conditions and are at high risk of infection .","the epidemic of coronavirus disease was first identified in wuhan , china and has now spread worldwide ."
"general information such as age , gender , marriage status , and the maslach burnout inventory - medical personnel ( mbi ) , were gathered and compared .","a survey with questions total was administered to medical staff members from the covid - 19 front lines and usual wards , with a ratio of : 1 ."
"the coronavirus disease ( covid - 19 ) pandemic , first identified in wuhan , china , and now spread worldwide , has raised concerns about the well - being of front - line ( fl ) health care workers .","to efficiently stop the spread of disease , general hospitals were deployed to the fl for infected patients with severe symptoms , while several of wuhan ' s sports stadiums and convention centers were renovated into mobile hospitals to treat patients with mild symptoms ."
burnout is receiving increasing recognition as a serious problem among medical professionals .,"due to increasing patient volumes , medical professionals who are not specialized in infectious disease gathered to support the fl , and may eerience even greater pressure when facing infected patients ."
"to support the fl , oncology - specialized physicians and nurses were dispatched from hubei cancer hospital ( hch ) , a specialized tertiary hospital with beds in wuhan .","we conducted a survey to elore and compare the burnout frequency of physicians and nurses from hch who worked in the fl , defined as one designated hospital , leishenshan hospital , and three mobile hospitals , versus their colleagues from the same institution who remained in their uw ."
the institutional review board ( irb ) of hch approved the survey and protocol .,two hundred and twenty physicians and nurses from hch were invited to enroll in this study .
chi - square test was used to assess the difference of frequencies of burnout between the fl and the uw .,"we applied standard descriptive statistics to summarize the responses to all survey questions , including median , interquartile range ( iqr ) , and range for continuous variables and frequency and proportion for categorical variables ."
"previous work has suggested that the number of years of eerience , the number of hours worked per week , the frequency of working on weekends , and the number of personnel in a person ' s team or practice may be associated with burnout .",results of these variables for fl and those working in their uw are summarized in table .
"the frequency of a low level of pa is lower in the fl group than in the uw group ( 39% vs %, p =0 . 002 ; table ) .","( 22 , the frequency of burnout is significantly lower in the fl group than in the uw group ( 13% versus %, p < . 0001 ) ."
more participants from the fl ( 76% ) strongly disagree or disagree that he / she feels more burnout now compared to before the covid - 19 crisis .,we asked questions about participants ' attitudes toward the effect of covid - 19 ( table ) .
"as covid - 19 spreads worldwide , ncreasing numbers of medical professionals will be needed to address the crisis to our knowledge , this is the first study focusing on and comparing the burnout frequency of medical staff working on the fl versus those working in their uw in the epicenter of the covid - 19 pandemic .","in our survey , we observed that participants from the fl had a significantly lower frequency of burnout in the past two months during the covid - 19 crisis ."
"those working in their usual wards may have perceived less control over new policies and procedures enacted to keep staff and patients safe , and in contrast to facing covid - 19 head - on , these workers may have had a sense that the virus could impact their workplace at any time , regardless of those policies .","additionally , cancer patients are particularly vulnerable to viral infection , and the covid - 19 pandemic has frequently necessitated suspension of cancer treatment and clinical trials4 , ) these situations may add additional workplace stress to oncology professionals working in their uw ."
"beyond the fl , the working life of physicians and nurses is highly disrupted even in their usual hospital wards .","in reality , the entire health care system is impacted by covid - 19 ."
"finally , it is important to note that our survey was conducted in march , when covid - 19 was generally considered to be under control in china ; our study has no way to ascertain the burnout status of medical staff members at the onset or peak period of wuhan ' s covid - 19 crisis .","moreover , even with an % response rate , selection bias may also have skewed our results if either highly distressed staff members or those who felt little distress chose not to participate ."
we examined the liver injury patterns and implication of non - alcoholic fatty liver diseases ( nafld ) on clinical outcomes in chinese with covid - 19 .,liver injury had been observed in covid - 19 patients with incidence ranging from - 53% .
"progressive diseases patients were older , had higher bmi , percentage of comorbidity and nafld (",sixty - seven ( 33.2% ) patients had persistent abnormal liver function from admission to discharge thirty - nine ( 19.3% ) and ( 80.7% ) had progressive and stable disease respectively .
the pattern of liver injury was mostly hepatocellular rather than cholestatic .,this is of interest as it had been shown that biliary cells have high eression of angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ace2 ) receptor with a high affinity to the spike protein of sars - cov - 2 .
"the continuous variables were eressed in median ( interquartile range , iqr ) , and compared using the mann - whitney test , categorical variables were presented as numbers ( percentage ) and compared by the chi - square test or fisher ' s exact test .","it remains speculative that the impaired innate immunity , manifested by derailed functional diversity of macrophages , imbalance between inflammation - promoting m1 macrophages and inflammation - suppressing m2 macrophages will lead to progression of covid - 19 ."
"however , the tasks required to fulfil the aforementioned goals are easier said than done .","main difficulties to overcome for virus detection and characterisation in water samples encompass viral diversity , occurrence of low particle numbers , particularly in drinking water , and the technical challenges of virus assays ."
"since current water treatments do not ensure their complete removal they become contaminants of the water environment in numbers high enough to represent a public health threat , although low enough to pose serious difficulties for their detection .","some of these viruses are shed in extremely high numbers , that is , patients suffering from diarrhoea or hepatitis may excrete up to and virus particles , respectively , per gram of stool ."
"it was figured that % of that burden is attributable to unsafe water supply , sanitation and hygiene and it is mostly concentrated on children in developing countries .",the world health organisation ( who ) declared that diarrhoeal disease alone contributes to an estimated % of the total daly ( disability adjusted life years ) global burden of disease and is responsible for the deaths of million people every year .
"other gastro enteric viruses , such as rotaviruses and astroviruses have also occasionally been implicated in waterborne outbreaks .","however , most well documented waterborne outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis are related to noroviruses ."
"another major waterborne disease is hepatitis that can be a serious debilitating disease progressing from a non - specific illness with fever , headache , nausea and malaise to vomiting , diarrhoea , abdominal pain and jaundice .",hepatitis a represents worldwide around % of the total hepatitis cases and although is self - limiting and rarely causing death may incapacitate patients for several months .
"these include not only waters used for drinking and recreation purposes but also those used for agricultural purposes such as crop irrigation , and food processing , eventually resulting in foodborne outbreaks .",water - related diseases are associated with eure to water environments in many ways .
criteria based on the eerience and eertise of the user on a given method should be employed to select the most appropriate system .,positively charged filters and glass wool based methods are still among the best possibilities .
"pathogenic viruses are routinely introduced into the environment through the discharge of treated and untreated wastes , since current treatment practices are unable to provide virus - free wastewater effluents .","in consequence viral pathogens contaminate the marine environment ( a ) , fresh water ( b ) and ground water ( c ) ."
the detection of infectious enteroviruses and even astroviruses or rotaviruses may be achieved by cell culture techniques with the appropriate cell line .,"despite recent reports of cell lines allowing the growth of wild - type hepatitis a virus and norovirus , issues related to assay complexity , cost - effectiveness and validity for the detection of a broad spectrum of isolates make their use a difficult and unrealistic approach for hepatitis a virus and norovirus detection , respectively ."
"nevertheless , as stated above , no alternative to molecular detection analysis exists for highly health significant waterborne viruses such as human norovirus and hepatitis a virus .",several studies show uncoupling between the number of genome copies and infectivity in environmental studies .
"it is needless to say that this genome variability implies a careful selection for highly conserved sequences targeting primers and probes , particularly when quantification is the objective .",rna regions containing complex multidomain structures involved in essential functions such as translation or replication are highly conserved and therefore are good candidates for this purpose .
"the best candidate for this latter purpose is the use of an encapsidated rna , such as rna animal viruses , rna bacteriophages or armoured rnas that are pseudoparticles made of target rnas packaged into ms2 coliphage coat protein .","while for the quantification of rna viruses in clinical samples the use of an internal control based on the detection of the eression of a housekeeping gene is a clear first choice , this is obviously not valid for water samples leading to compromise in the use of an external control ."
the inclusion of the control measures above described calls for the development of multiplex approaches with the aim to analyse several pathogens in a single assay without increasing the economic cost .,multiplex formats may be based on real - time amplification or pcr - microarray systems .
such a situation could be a fertile ground for a poliovirus - like agent to emerge by mutation .,one example is the potential emergence of diverse polioviruses from c - cluster coackie a viruses and its implication in a poliovirus - free world with a poliovirus - antibody na ve population .
the availability of methods for accurate quantitative virus detection enables a sensible prospective water safety approach based on the identification and prevention of hazards that could cause waterborne illnesses .,this is the basis of the hazard analysis and critical control point ( haccp ) principles that must be applied to ensure the virological safety of the water environment .
these shortcomings may be already hard to overcome for well - known pathogens and awesome for newly emerging agents .,"the actual burden of waterborne viral infections is still hard to figure owing to technical limitations in pathogen detection , scarce data on environmental epidemiology , difficulties in determining the source of infection and occurrence of unapparent infections , among others ."
"the community attitude survey was conducted with a sample of , 020 adults living in a low - income township in the eastern cape province , south africa .",the study found that the moral and the biomedical understanding of tb risk are intertwined .
the final section discusses the conclusions drawn from the findings of the three - phased study and recommendations for future research .,the fourth section reports results from the three phases of the study that relate to the risk and stigma associated with drinking and smoking .
"according to deacon ' s extensive literature review , disease stigma can be understood as a problem of fear and blame rather than as a problem of ignorance .","importantly , stigma may consist of beliefs that are part of a social process that differentiates against those with a drinking , smoking , and morality disease in negative social as well as biological terms ."
"typically , marginal groups are blamed for engaging in a lifestyle which involves risky behaviour that results in infection , then for perpetuating the epidemic by defaulting on treatment due to these habits ( ware et al .",the specific behaviour eected of morally upright citizens may differ according to the cultural setting ( alonzo and reynolds ; link and phelan ; lichtenstein ) .
the reviewers note that authors eected most drinkers to be in the tb group because of the known association between drinking and smoking : most drinkers were also smokers ( maurya et al .,the evidence from these studies suggested that smoking should be considered an important risk factor for tb .
the south african government has successfully banned smoking in public places and has sought to regulate the selling of liquor .,education campaigns warn of the health risks of smoking and the dangers of drinking and driving .
"the study was conducted in a low - income residential area of grahamstown , makana municipality , a small university town and educational centre in the eastern cape province that has no industry and a high rate of unemployment .","the township of rhini ( estimated , 000 population ) , formerly reserved for black residents during the apartheid era , has a high incidence of tb ."
"to assist with the interpretation of the survey results , we conducted a second set of group discussions that focused on risks and stigma associated with drinking and smoking .",the research proceeded in three stages : a pilot study using focus - group methodology was conducted in early to inform a larger sample survey fielded in late .
"discussants in the eight groups were recruited purposefully among community health workers , tb patients in hospital , high school pupils , out - of - school youth , middleaged women , a mixed group of middle - aged adults , older men and women , and traditional healers ( see m ller and erstad ) .",a total of men and women were interviewed with the aim of covering a wide range of viewpoints .
"their comments suggested that the drinkers and smokers might belong to a maligned or marked group akin to the scapegoat that is burdened with the ill in society , a theme under investigation in the second and third phases of the study .","the focus - group discussants were of the opinion that tb patients , who smoked or drank while on treatment , could not eect to be cured ."
"options included both social and environmental factors considered to be relevant in a high tb prevalence setting : hiv - co - infection , poverty , overcrowded living conditions , low social status indicated by lack of education and employment , and a tainted character or lack of social respectability indicated by non - conformist or socially discredited behaviour such as laziness , promiscuity , not going to church regularly , frequenting shebeens , and excessive drinking and smoking .","table shows that over four rounds of responses , the highest proportion of respondents identified people who ' drink and smoke a lot ' to be at the greatest risk of tb ."
"conversely , a similarly high proportion ( 47% ) identified drinkers and smokers as treatment defaulters .","in later sections of the interview , a substantial proportion of respondents ( 47% ) stated that abstaining from drinking and smoking was a recipe for success in completing tb treatment ."
opinions were split evenly as to whether treatment defaulters or the aids epidemic was to blame for the high incidence of tb in the province ( table ) .,the majority opinion was that only strict abstinence from drinking and smoking was compatible with successful treatment ( table ) .
the beta values for these two predictor variables are highly significant .,the constellation of beta values for the non - significant predictors in the model suggests that people who see drinking and smoking as a tb risk factor might have a tendency to be harsher on thinks increase in incidence of tb in the province is due to aids ( rather than treatment defaulters ) c . 29 . 060
this supposition was elored further in focus - group discussions with residents from rhini .,it may not be far - fetched to suggest that ' drinkers and smokers ' is short - hand for connotations of licentiousness and social deviance .
"with reference to the two - faced identity of the proverbial scapegoat outlined in the literature , do ' drinkers and smokers ' attract rejection as marginalised ' others ' or sympathy as lapsed members of the community ?","are ' drinkers and smokers ' a stereotype , a form of ' othering ' as described in the literature on disease stigma ?"
"' ' us blacks who drink right through until the bottle is empty , then follow more and more bottles ' ' .","a woman in the middle - aged group commented that africans , unlike some of their white south african counterparts , appeared to be prone to drinking heavily rather than in moderation ."
there was consensus in all groups that the drinkers outnumbered the churchgoers in rhini .,churchgoers might also drink but their participation in church services on sundays interrupted their drinking sessions and thus limited their consumption of alcohol .
smoking tobacco and dagga ( cannabis ) increased pleasure and enhanced the effects of alcohol .,"both drinking and smoking predisposed to contracting tb , but drinkers , who were usually also smokers , were seen to be most at risk ."
their lives focused on drinking so much that they lost interest in eating properly .,"smokers were different from other people : their addiction to alcohol and tobacco and dagga , in particular , had mind - altering effects ."
"both were attracted to and made welcome in shebeens that did not discriminate between the employed and unemployed , educated or uneducated , rich and poor .",focus - group discussants made a distinction between those driven to drink to relieve stress and frustration and those who drank for ' fun ' .
some argued that drinkers and smokers had freely chosen to adopt a lifestyle dangerous to themselves and the wider community .,all groups were divided when it came to blaming drinkers and smokers .
the character sketch of the typical drinker and smoker below is based on the consensus votes of the five groups of discussants .,each group was asked to identify the most characteristic traits and behaviours of drinkers and smokers on the list .
"they are generally selfish , they pick fights , and have given up caring .",they cannot be trusted as they take risks and sleep around .
"drinkers and smokers include the hard working and the lazy , the clean and the dirty .","non - distinctive descriptors : drinking and smoking cuts across the social divide : drinkers and smokers include both young and old , rich and poor , people with paid work and the unemployed , people who live in solid houses and in shacks ."
"in addition , they added a further descriptor , that of injubaqa , a ' rowdy hooligan ' , who is beyond being helped .",' ' they are the ones whose families have given up on them ' ' .
"when commenting on the difference between drinkers and smokers and other people , a member of the youth discussion group identified drinkers and smokers as the carriers of disease : ' ' the ones who bring us ' things ' while we stay at home ' ' .",social distancing or ' othering ' was most evident when discussing the twin risks of tb and hiv - infection associated with drinking and smoking .
"in former times , respondents observed , heavy drinking was restricted mainly to men but that had changed .","when discussing the words in the semantic differential , the male churchgoers noted that ' ' even the clean ones become dirty because they end up sharing partners the same day and have no time for washing ' ' ."
"aids is the recent one , but it also comes in with that .","' ' you get involved with a stranger and have intercourse hence get positive in different ways , e . g . , have igcushuwa ( a sexually transmitted disease ) ."
they agreed that drinkers and smokers were mainly responsible for spreading tb .,"apart from being careless about coughing and spitting , they also ' ' drink and go to bed with different partners ' ' ."
an uneected finding in our community survey prompted us to inquire in greater depth into perceptions of the typical south african ' drinker and smoker ' .,survey respondents identified ' drinkers and smokers ' as being most at risk of contracting tb ( table ) .
"drinking , smoking , and morality the above findings suggested that ' drinkers and smokers ' might constitute a stereotype , a form of ' othering ' as described in the literature on stigma , that serves to distance the community from contamination with moral pollution and a health threat .",survey respondents who linked drinking and smoking to tb risk were more likely to blame drinkers and smokers ( ' get what they deserve ' ) for spreading the disease than treatment defaulters generally .
"the semantic differential outcome suggested that drinking and smoking , including ' stress ' drinking , is not exclusive to the poor and unemployed ; drinkers and smokers included a mix of generations and social strata .",the churchgoing discussants tended to regard drinkers and smokers as lapsed christians .
"the shebeen - patron discussants painted a similar self - portrait of the drinkerinterestingly , their self - deprecating auto - stereotype matched the one produced by the other discussion groups completing the word game .","following smith ' s distinction between popular presentations of disease as ' stigma ' or ' challenge ' , these findings suggest that there is prejudice against drinkers and smokers whose plight is at the same time regarded as a challenge that needs to be addressed by mainstream society ."
the older generation of charismatic churches of africa were established as independent centres of worship ( centre for enterprise and development ) .,"historically , the african churches and the township shebeen share a proud track record of defiance ."
our study of attitudes to drinking and smoking as perceived tb risk factor sought to fill the gap .,the pilot study confirmed that the stigma associated with aids affects tb sufferers and acts as a barrier to the detection and treatment of tb ( m ller and erstad ) .
"smoking and drinking are moral risk - factors visible in the community , and thus easy to use in scapegoating .","poverty as a structural risk - factor ( farmer ; erstad ) was not mentioned as frequently , possibly because the participants in this study are living in poverty themselves ."
it is therefore recommended that further research be conducted in a range of settings using the bio - medical or sociological approach or a combination of both .,it is possible that the drinker and smoker stereotype is a product of the south african social setting in which poverty and discrimination has driven the politically and economically oppressed to find solace and an independence of spirit in either the church or the shebeen .
"in these investigations , the ability to connect illnesses to a common organ donor was facilitated by the fact that multiple recipients were hospitalized at the same facility .","as organ and tissue transplantation becomes more common , the potential risks of disease transmission may also increase ."
"because of improved diagnostic assays , donor - transmitted infections are increasingly recognized , although often times , the impact of infection is not well understood .","the advent of polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) and other genetic material - based tests have allowed for detection of active viremia , in contrast to serologic tests , which reflect past acquisition of infection ."
an immediate system for tracking and disseminating pertinent patient data to evaluate donor - derived infection and associated adverse event outcomes is needed .,"investigation of potential donor - transmitted infection requires rapid communication among physicians in transplant centers , organ procurement organizations , and public health authorities ."
"the specific virus , the tissue infected , stimuli for activation , and the nature of the host immune response impact the nature of viral latency .","given the frequency of latent viral infection , notably among herpesviruses , reactivation of latent infection provides a major source of infection after transplantation ."
"immune control of hsv infection and replication occurs at the level of skin or mucosa during initial or recurrent infection and in the dorsal root ganglion , where latency and reactivation are controlled by immune mechanisms mediated by interferons , myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells , cd4 ( + ) and c ( + ) t cells , and other cytokines .",ebv establishes latency in b lymphocytes in association with eression of a limited set of viral genes .
"immune suppression is not essential for the reactivation of latent cmv , but serves to perpetuate such infections once activated .",subclinical activation of cmv is common and increasing diagnosed by sensitive molecular assays .
the hosts ' direct pathway antiviral cellular immune response within allografts is less effective due to mismatched major histocompatibility antigens between the organ donor and host with dependence on indirect pathways of antigen presentation .,these factors may render the allograft more susceptible to viral infection .
reactivation of one virus may lead to reactivation of others ; multiple studies have shown that infection with hhv - 6 and / or hhv - 7 are risk factors for cmv disease and cmv infection may trigger hhv - 6 and hhv - 7 reactivation .,"other less clinically common viral infections related to reactivation include the polyoma viruses bk and jc , human herpes virus ( hhv - 6 ) , human herpes virus ( hhv - 7 ) , and hhv - 8 ."
"for example , parvovirus b19 infection is often more persistent and relapsing in transplantation patients , occasionally complicated by the unusual findings of hepatitis , myocarditis , pneumonitis , glomerulopathy , arthritis , or transplantation graft dysfunction .","in the absence of previous immunity and with the attenuation of immunity due to the immunosuppressive regimen , new infections are often more severe and prolonged than in the general population ."
the effects of viral infection are conceptualized as ' direct ' and ' indirect ' ( see table ) .,"this classification serves to separate the tissueinvasive viral infection ( cellular and tissue injury ) from effects mediated by inflammatory responses ( e . g . , cytokines ) or by alterations in host immune responses ."
ebv - seronegative individuals with primary infection after transplantation are at increased risk for ebv - mediated ptld .,"ptld constitutes a spectrum of disease , which is often responsive to reduced immunosuppression in previously immune hosts ."
"hhv - 6 commonly reactivates after transplantation , especially after hsct where it is associated with hepatitis , pneumonitis , cmv reactivation , bone marrow suppression , and encephalitis .","hhv6 causes less symptomatic clinical infection after sot , although the indirect effects of reactivation have not been studied ."
novel therapies for hepatitis c should reduce the risk of treatment complications after transplant .,"for hepatitis b , the goal is complete viral suppression before and after transplantation , using antiviral agents and sometimes hepatitis b immunoglobulin ."
"antiviral medications ( rimantidine , amantidine , or oseltamivir ) may prevent or reduce the severity of illness .","respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza are the most common community - acquired respiratory viruses , followed by influenza and adenovirus ."
some groups have suggested a possible correlation with graft rejection in lung transplant recipients .,diagnosis is often made using molecular assays ; the full impact of this infection in transplantation is yet to be realized .
enteroviral infections in the summer months in the northern hemispheres are common and can have a more complicated and prolonged course in renal transplantation recipients .,gastrointestinal viruses such as rotavirus or norwalk virus may cause significant diarrhea and dehydration ; prolonged infections for months have been seen in transplant recipients .
infection by jc polyomavirus has been observed in renal allograft recipients as both nephropathy ( in association with bk virus or alone ) and / or progressive multifocal encephalopathy ( pml ) .,jcv establishes renal latency but receptors are present in multiple tissues including the brain .
the recent arrival of a vaccine for genital hpv infections may help reduce these infections .,"human papilloma virus ( hpv ) infections can cause significant disease in renal transplantation recipients , including oral , skin , genital , and rectal lesions ranging from warts and dysplasia to malignancy ( especially squamous cell carcinoma ) ."
direct renal involvement with glomerulopathy and allograft dysfunction has been reported in renal transplantation recipients .,"in transplantation recipients , parvovirus b19 infection can cause erythropoietin - resistant anemia , pancytopenia , myocarditis , or pneumonitis ."
"wnv is more morbid after sot ; the risk of meningoencephalitis in a sot patient infected with wnv has been estimated to be %, compared with < 1% in normal hosts .","all have been recently reported as donor - derived infections related to sot , with clinically subtle infections in the donor and often deadly infections in the recipients ."
preliminary studies suggest that both patient and graft survival are similar in hiv - negative and hiv - positive kidney and liver transplantation recipients .,"although hiv - infected patients are living longer and dying less often from complications related to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( aids ) , they are eeriencing significant morbidity and mortality related to end - stage liver and renal disease ."
"in one series , % of patients with parvovirus b19 infection as shown by pcr assay had a negative igm assay .","serologic assays are generally less sensitive in transplant patients , as humoral immune responses may be delayed or absent ."
"adenovirus may be detectable in local infections , such as cystitis , with negative blood assays .","bk polyomavirus may be detectable in the urine ( either by cytology , looking for the classic decoy cells , or by pcr ) before it is detectable in the blood , providing a window of opportunity for reducing immunosuppression possibly in advance of invasive disease ."
"as protective cytotoxic immunity to viruses is generally t - cell ( c + ) mediated , an initial reduction of antimetabolites ( if neutropenic ) and calcineurin inhibitors merits consideration .","reducing the immunosuppressive regimen during active viral infection can be a major contribution toward clearing infection , although it presents a risk of graft rejection ."
"meta - analyses suggest that universal prophylaxis with antiviral medications in sot recipients reduces cmv disease and cmv - associated opportunistic infections , graft rejection , and mortality ; their use is recommended for high risk individuals ( cmv - positive recipients and in cmv - negative recipients of cmv - positive organs ) .","the relative advantages of universal prophylaxis ( i . e . , the use of antiviral medication in all susceptible patients for a period after transplantation ) or monitoring with preemptive ( early ) therapy remain to be established ."
"this may be most apparent in the setting of active infections , as well as prophylaxis .","immunostimulatory agents , such as interferon - alpha used to treat hepatitis c , can be helpful at treating the viral infection but may perturb the relationship between the graft and the host , precipitating rejection ."
"antibody responses were measured by hemagglutination - inhibition assay ) on days , , and months after the first vaccine injection in vaccinated patients and ) before pandemic and after influenza a / h1n1pdm09 infection , in patients presented natural infection .","at baseline , % of recipients of adjuvanted vaccine and % of infected patients were seroprotected ( antibody titer / 40 ) ."
the adjuvanted vaccine was safe with low rate of gvhd worsening .,"in multivariate analysis , no immunosuppressive treatment or chronic graft - versus - host disease ( gvhd ) and longer time between transplantation and vaccination / infection were associated with a stronger humoral response ."
"a mortality rate around % was reported in untreated patients , but recent data suggest an improvement of outcome for patients treated with neuraminidase inhibitors .","in a large prospective study of allogeneic hsct recipients with influenza a / h1n1pdm2009 infection , % of patients with low respiratory tract disease required mechanical ventilation and % died from influenza infection or its complications ."
"therefore , the french health authorities recommended the use of two doses of the adjuvanted pandemic influenza a / h1n1pdm09 vaccine in allogeneic hsct recipients .","moreover , in , the emergence of a pandemic influenza virus has prompted the use of oil - in - water - emulsion adjuvant to enhance influenza vaccine immunogenicity ."
"to further evaluate the effect of these vaccination modalities , we compared the humoral response observed after adjuvanted vaccination to that observed after influenza a / h1n1pdm09 virus infection in hsct patients included retrospectively .",the primary objective was to compare humoral response observed after vaccination by doses of influenza a / h1n1pdm09 adjuvanted vaccine and natural infection in allogeneic hsct recipients .
the day of inclusion in the study was the day of the first vaccine administration .,patients received two intramuscular injection ( in deltoid muscle ) of monovalent influenza a / h1n1pdm09 vaccine administered days apart .
the day of sampling with positive pcr for diagnosis was considered as day .,"post - infection sera were sampled at least days after infection , whenever the patients came for a follow - up post - transplant visit ."
"however , patients received a non - adjuvanted vaccine ( panenza [ 15 g of hemagglutinin ] , sanofi - pasteur , lyon , france ) according to the choice of the physician , particularly in patients with active gvhd .","fifty nine patients received an inactivated split - virion preparation of the influenza a / california / 07/2009 ( h1n1 ) strain containing 5 g of hemagglutinin and as03 adjuvant ( pandemrix , gsk , uk ) ."
vaccinated patients recorded occurrence and severity of local or general reactions and any unsolicited adverse events during days after each injection .,clinical or biological data about potential onset or worsening of gvhd were also collected .
"in infected patients , available frozen sera sampled before the onset of symptoms and at least days after the diagnosis of infection were tested .","in all vaccinated patients , sera were obtained and tested prior to vaccination ( d0 ) and days after each vaccine injection ( d21 , and d42 ) ; in of these patients , sera could be obtained and tested at months post - immunization ( m6 ) ."
"myeloablative conditioning regimens included either high dose busulfan ( dose > mg / kg orally or intravenous equivalent ) or high dose total body irradiation ( gy fractioned dose ) , both associated with cyclophosphamide .",regimens not meeting these criteria were classified as reduced intensity conditioning ( ric ) .
"in patients who received curative treatment of gvhd at the time of study entry , this treatment included corticosteroids in most cases .","in patients who received prophylactic treatment of gvhd at the time of study entry , this treatment consisted of cyclosporine in most cases ."
for gmt and gmt ratio95 % confidence intervals were computed by taking the enent of the mean and of the lower and upper limits of the % ci of the logtransformed titers .,"for seroprotection and seroconversion rates , exact confidence intervals ( ci ) were calculated ."
gmt at day and day were compared using student ' s t - test for paired data .,the seroprotection and seroconversion rates at day and day were compared using the mac nemar ' s test .
comparisons of characteristics of patients described by qualitative variables used fisher ' s exact tests .,patient characteristics and immunogenicity data eressed as continuous variables were compared between the different groups using kruskal - wallis global tests ; subsequent pairewise multiple comparisons used the bonferroni - protected ( at 17 level ) conover - iman procedure as implemented in xlstat 8 ( addinsoft tm ) .
"a multivariate stepwise logistic model ( level of significance 5 for entry , 5 for staying ) was used to adjust for covariates .","analysis of factors associated with gmt ratio was performed using univariate and multivariate stepwise linear regression model of logarithm of titer ratio , using the same thresholds ."
eleven patients who received the non - adjuvanted vaccine were also included in the study but only for the safety analysis .,ninety hsct recipients were included in the study : were vaccinated with an adjuvanted vaccine and received the first dose of vaccine between november and february ; presented proven influenza a / h1n1pdm09 infection between october and march .
nineteen patients recovered from their influenza infection ; one patient died from leukemia relapse while still excreting influenza a / h1n1pdm09 virus despite antiviral treatment with oseltamivir and zanamivir .,"among / 20 infected patients with available data about prior influenza a / h1n1pdm2009 vaccination , only one received one dose of the pandemic vaccine ."
local and general adverse events reported after vaccination were significantly more frequent in patients receiving the adjuvanted vaccine as compared to the non - adjuvanted one : % vs . % ( p = 04 ) for local side adverse events and % vs . % ( p = 4 ) for general adverse events .,four patients did not receive the second vaccine injection due to the occurrence of adverse events after the first dose : with the adjuvanted vaccine and one with the non - adjuvanted vaccine ( p = ) .
the baseline seroprotection rate and gmt of the patients vaccinated with the adjuvanted vaccine were % and .,"the seroprotection rate increased from % at d21 after the first injection to %, after the second one at d42 ( p = 15 ) ; likewise the seroconversion rate increased from % at d21 to % at d42 ( p = 07 ) and the gmt from at d21 to at d42 ( p < 001 ) ."
"similar results were observed for seroconversion rates ( 66% vs . % ; p = , gmt ( 96.6 vs . ; p = 9 ) and for gmt ratios ( 13.6 vs . ; p = 7 ) in vaccinated and infected patients , respectively .",the seroprotection rates were % in vaccinated patients at d42 and % in infected patients ( p = .
other studies in allogeneic hsct recipients showed similar responses using the same vaccination regimen and higher responses were also reported .,"nevertheless , these studies included patients with different clinical characteristics , in particular longer period of time between transplantation and vaccination ."
"in the present study , hsct recipients were planned to receive the doses of vaccine recommended by the french guidelines and the recent guidelines of the th ecil .",the significant increase of specific antibody titer between the first and the second administration of adjuvanted vaccine highly suggests the interest of the second dose of vaccine .
there is little information about antibody dynamics induced by natural influenza infection in humans .,only a few studies compared the humoral immune response induced by influenza vaccination or natural infection and they were conducted in immunocompetent subjects .
the proportions of patients who did not receive the second dose due to adverse events were comparable in the two groups .,"the same was observed for the rates of chronic gvhd worsening , which remained low in both groups ."
"however we considered hsct recipients with proven h1n1pdm09 infection as the most relevant control group to evaluate new modalities of vaccination , despite the heterogeneity and the small number of patients included in this group .",the main limitation of our study is the small number of infected patients and their retrospective inclusion that led to large time intervals between blood sampling before and after infection .
the lack of seroprotection in some patients after natural infection or vaccination is most likely elained by a poor post - transplant immune recovery .,the humoral response observed after vaccination in this immunosuppressed population reaches out of emea criteria for evaluation of influenza vaccines in healthy subjects .
"nd , bl , job , pa , mtr , at , pr , recruited the patients ; ak , nlc , jlg and ba performed the laboratory work for this study ; am performed the statistical analysis ; nd , ak , pr and nlc wrote the paper .",nd and ak were the principal investigators and take primary responsibility for the paper ; ba participated to the design of the study .
they may be uni - or bilateral and superficial or extend into the nostril .,the defect arises from incomplete fusion of the frontonasal process with the maxillary processes .
"the hard palate is formed , except for a small anterior contribution from the frontonasal process , by the bilateral ingrowth of the palatine shelves from the maxillary processes .","at the midline , they fuse with each other and the nasal septum , except in their posterior part , which becomes the soft palate ."
the defects are probably polygenic or multifactorial developmental anomalies in this species and also may be associated with crotalaria intoxication .,"secondary cleft palate occurs in siamese cats and is thought to be hereditary in this breed , although the mode of inheritance has not been determined ."
"brachygnathia superior , shortness of the maxillae , is an inherited breed characteristic among dogs and swine .",it has been reported in the large white or yorkshire breed .
the defect is one of the most common anomalies in lambs but is rare in cattle .,"agnathia is a mandibulofacial malformation characterized by absence of the lower jaw , due to failure of development of the first branchial arch and associated structures ."
the reader is referred to the skin and appendages ( volume ) for detailed descriptions of these conditions .,"there are several hereditary skin conditions in animals that have minor involvement of the lips and oral mucosa , such as epidermolysis bullosa simplex in collie dogs , ovine epidermolysis bullosa in suffolk and south dorset down sheep , and familial acantholysis of aberdeen angus calves ."
"the "" borderland of embryology and pathology "" is never more nebulous than it is for teeth , and the comments on dental development and anatomy given below are intended to assist the understanding of dental disease .","dental examinations in animals are usually cursory , except to assess age , but dental disease is common and often is the factor that limits the useful life span , especially of sheep ."
it molds dental papilla to form the root or apex of the tooth .,"the free edge of the enamel organ extends beyond the enamel - dentin junction , and this extension is called hertwig ' s epithelial root sheath ."
"in hypsodont teeth , enamel extends far down on the roots and is invaginated into the dentin to form infundibula .","also , the hypsodont teeth of herbivores , except the mandibular premolars of ruminants , are covered by cementum that more or less fills the infundibula ."
"thus its composition is similar to bone , and like bone it contains type i collagen .","dentin is produced by columnar cells with basal nuclei called odontoblasts , which differentiate from mesenchyme of the dental papilla ."
"sometimes , irregular zones of unmineralized or poorly mineralized dentin form between foci of normal mineralization .","sublethal injury caused by certain infections , metabolic stresses , or toxic states may injure the odontoblasts , which then produce accentuated incremental lines known as the contour lines of owen ."
sclerotic ( transparent ) dentin is formed when dentinal tubules are occluded by calcium salts .,"the junctions between primary , secondary , and reparative dentin are usually demarcated by basophilic lines ."
"enamel is produced in the form of prisms or rods , cemented together by a matrix .","it is produced by the tall , columnar ameloblasts of the inner enamel epithelium ."
fusion of the two epithelia is necessary for eruption to occur .,"degeneration of this protective layer permits connective tissue to contact the enamel , and there may be resorption of enamel or deposition of a layer of cementum on it ."
"they differentiate into cementoblasts , which produce cementoid and later mineralize it .","when dentin formation has begun in the root , degeneration of hertwig ' s epithelial root sheath begins and permits mesenchymal cells from the dental sac to contact dentin ."
"when extra cementum improves the functional properties of teeth , it is called cementum hypertrophy ; if not , it is called cementum hyperplasia .",hypercementosis is abnormal thickening of cementum and may involve part or all of one or many teeth .
epithelial rests of malassez are present in the periodontal ligament and are particularly numerous in the incisor region of sheep .,"in all species , they may proliferate and become cystic when there is inflammation of the periodontium ."
"they are occasionally bilateral , and rarely the tooth may form a pedunculated mass enclosed by skin and attached by a pedicle to the skin of the head .",the cysts form in the parotid region and may fistulate to the exterior .
malformation and malpositioning of teeth accompany abnormalities of the jaw bones .,"aberdeen angus and hereford calves with congenital osteopetrosis have brachygnathia inferior , malformed mandibles , and impacted cheek teeth ( see bones and joints , volume ) ."
"of the odontogenic cysts just listed , all except those derived from cell rests of malassez are potentially dentigerous .","dentigerous cysts are , by definition , cysts that contain part or all of a tooth , which often is malformed ."
"the ear tooth of horses is probably the most common nono - dontogenic dentigerous cyst ( see heterotopic polyodontia , above ) .","occasionally , true dentigerous cysts form when a tumor prevents normal eruption or when there is maleruption due to odontody strophy ."
permanent teeth are unique in that their development continues for a long time after birth .,thus inflammatory and metabolic disease of postnatal life can produce hypoplasia of dentin and enamel .
"tetracyclines are toxic to ameloblasts in the late differentiation and early secretion stages and , at high dose rate , may produce enamel hypoplasia .",treatment of the pregnant dam may cause staining of deciduous teeth in the offspring .
"the mature conformation of teeth is largely the outcome of opposed growth and wear , and the degree of wear depends on the type of tooth , the species of animal , and the matter chewed .","wear is most evident in herbivores , and irregularities of wear are perhaps the most common dental ab -"
"as soon as wear of enamel ees the dentin , which being softer wears more rapidly , secondary dentin is deposited to protect the pulp .",normal wear of the complicated cheek teeth of horses and cattle causes smoothing of the occlusal surfaces .
incomplete longitudinal coincidence of the molar arcades allows irregular wear and hook formation on the first and last cheek teeth .,"abnormal wear due to abnormal chewing is caused by voluntary , as in painful conditions , or mechanical impairment of jaw movement ."
"thus lesions in actively forming dentin may be repaired , while those in enamel are permanent .","odontoblasts are susceptible to many of the same influences as ameloblasts , but they can be replenished from the undifferentiated cells of the dental pulp ."
this harmonious arrangement often is upset in the odontodystrophies and osteodystrophies and leads to malocclusion and anomalous development of teeth .,"because of their close anatomic association with the jaws , teeth are very susceptible to disruption in the harmony of growth ."
"in vitamin a deficiency , ameloblasts do not differentiate normally , and their organizing ability is disturbed .","fluorine poisoning is exemplary ( see metabolic diseases of bone , in bones and joints , volume ) ."
teeth formed during the period of deficiency are very susceptible to wear .,calcium deficiency retards eruption and causes enamel hypoplasia and mild dentin hypoplasia .
the major effects of odontodystrophies in herbivores are malocclusion and / or accelerated attrition .,"sometimes a high incidence of these abnormalities is attributable to one of the causes discussed above , but often they are idiopathic ."
this syndrome exemplifies the naturally occurring odontodystrophies in that it probably has a complex pathogenesis and is associated with an osteodystrophy .,the latter association is to be eected since bones and teeth usually are susceptible to the same insults .
"dental plaque is a dense , nonmineralized , bacterial mass , firmly adherent to tooth surfaces , that resists removal by salivary flow .",formation of plaque involves adhesion of bacteria to the pellicle and adhesion of bacteria to each other .
"some utilize polymers derived from host secretions to adhere to the pellicle , while others attach to bacteria of a different species already fixed to the tooth .","plaque increases in mass with time , and its composition becomes more complex as gramnegative bacteria join the streptococci and actinomycetes that initiated plaque formation ."
red - brown to black calculus with a metallic sheen develops in pastured sheep and goats .,"it usually involves all the incisors , principally on the neck of the buccal surface ."
"dental caries is a disease of the hard tissues of teeth , characterized by demineralization of the inorganic part and enzymatic degradation of the organic matrix .",this definition permits the inclusion of equine infundibular necrosis as a form of caries ( see below ) .
"smooth - surface caries usually occurs on proximal ( adjacent ) surfaces of teeth , typically just below contact points or around the neck , and requires dental plaque for its initiation .","plaque is not essential for initiation of this form of caries , of which equine infundibular necrosis is an example ."
"in smooth - surface caries , plaque produces the acid and maintains a low ph on the surface of the tooth .","the organic acids , principally lactic , that initiate demineralization are produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary carbohydrates ."
"in sheep , the proximal surfaces of mandibular teeth are usually affected , and caries is commonly accompanied by periodontitis .","in horses and dogs , caries develops most often on the occlusal surface of the maxillary first molar ."
"filling proceeds from the occlusal surface toward the apex , but often is not completed before eruption .",the enamel invaginations ( infundibula ) in the cheek teeth of horses normally are filled with cementum before the teeth erupt .
"most are without signs , and in most the lesion does not progress .","the incidence of infundibular necrosis increases with age , and - 100% of horses more than years old may have the lesion ."
"in herbivores the pulp is divided by enamel foldings , inflammation usually is limited to one division and is usually purulent .","very mild pulpitis may heal , but usually it terminates in necrosis , suppuration , or gangrene ."
osteomyelitis of the jaws is a complication of clipping the tusks of piglets .,inflammation of the pulp may extend to the periodontium and the jaws .
"although there are minor differences between species , in general , periodontal disease begins as plaqueassociated gingivitis and may progress through gingival recession and loss of alveolar bone to chronic periodontitis and exfoliation of teeth .","periodontal disease is the most common chronic disease of humans , the most common dental disease of sheep and dogs , and an important problem in horses , ruminants , and cats ."
"clinically normal animals have a few lymphocytes , plasma cells , and macrophages under the crevicular epithelium of the gingiva , which forms the outer wall of the crevice , and under the junctional epithelium , which is apposed to the enamel of the tooth .",the gingival sulcus or crevice is an invagination formed by the gingiva as it joins with the tooth surface at the time of eruption .
"sheep develop acute gingivitis during tooth eruption , in association with accumulation of subgingival plaque around the tooth .","in sheep , periodontal disease may involve all teeth , but the effects are most severe on the incisors , and periodontal disease is a major cause of premature exfoliation ."
"evidence that periodontal disease in humans and other animals is primarily a nutritional disease , and that the bone resorption is caused by hyperparathyroidism , has been presented but is not generally accepted .","a major part of chronic periodontal disease is resorption of alveolar bone , which modifies the attachment site of the periodontal ligament ."
"in dogs , involvement of the canine teeth may produce internal or external fistulas , and involvement of the maxillary carnassials usually produces a fistula beneath the eye , and orbital inflammation .","if the premolars are involved , fistulation may develop into the nasal cavity or externally ."
"it may be irregular , or the mucosa may be entirely pigmented .",pigmentation melanotic pigmentation is normal and common in most breeds of animals and increases with age .
"swine have a diverticulum of the pharynx in the posterior wall immediately above the esophagus , and barley awns and other rough plant fibers occasionally lodge here and penetrate the pharynx .","this occurs mainly in young pigs , and death fol - lows pharyngeal cellulitis ."
"it is often not possible to differentiate the cause of diffuse stomatitides , but an attempt to do so is important because it may indicate a systemic disease state .",electrical burns are occasionally seen in puppies or kittens that chew through electrical wires .
"for this reason , there is little distention of lymphatics and tissue spaces with fluid exudate , and therefore , swelling due to edema is not a significant part of stomatitis involving gums and hard palate .","the lamina propria of the oral epithelium is well vascularized , but generally dense and relatively inelastic ."
"however , foci of previous erosion may be identifiable for some months by their slight depression and lack of pigmentation .","vesicular stomatitides in animals have been associated with viral infections , and these are still the most common causes ."
"the disease is similar , if not identical , to pemphigus vulgaris in humans .","clinically , affected dogs and cats show excessive salivation , halitosis , and erosions and ulcerations of the oral mucosa ."
"however , extensive erosion and ulceration of the mucosa and secondary bacterial infections frequently obscure these clefts and bullae .",several biopsies from different areas of the oral mucosa may be required to demonstrate the characteristic lesions .
"the characteristic microscopic lesions are subepidermal blisters , which may contain fibrinocellular exudate .",direct immunofluorescence of lesions shows autoantibody ( igg ) and complement deposits along the basement membrane .
they occur mainly on the anterodorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue and each side of the midline of the hard palate .,the palatine lesions are apparently more severe in cats fed dry food .
"ulcers , in contrast to erosions , are deeper deficiencies that extend into the substantia propria .","they heal cleanly and quickly , but if secondarily infected or complicated , may develop into ulcers ."
the causes of ulcerative stomatitis are in general those of erosive stomatitis .,"there are , however , a number of recognized syndromes and specific diseases in which the predominant change is ulcerative ."
these lesions may comprise the largest group of feline oral clinical conditions .,"the cause is unknown but is probably multifactorial , involving imbalance in the oral microbial flora , with predominance of spirochetes ."
"eosinophilic ulcer ( eosinophilic granuloma , lick granuloma , labial ulcer , "" rodent ulcer "" ) is a chronic , superficial ulcerative lesion of the mucocutaneous junctions of the lips and to a lesser extent the oral mucosa and skin , in cats of all ages .","the cause is unknown , but the lesions may respond to corticosteroid or radiation therapy , although recurrences are common ."
"skin lesions are located in those areas that are frequently licked , such as the neck , lumbar area , and abdomen .","microscopically , eosinophilic ulcer is characterized by ulceration of the squamous mucosa , with large areas of necrosis of the underlying connective tissues , accompanied by a marked inflammatory cell reaction ."
"the other two conditions , eosinophilic plaque and linear granuloma , cause mainly skin lesions , which are different clinically and morphologically from eosinophilic ulcer .",eosinophilic ulcer is considered to be one of the three different types of lesion that have been associated with the so - called eosinophilic granuloma complex .
"affected dogs have single or multiple , firm , often ulcerated , raised plaques , which are covered by a yellow - brown exudate , on the lateral or ventral surfaces of the tongue .",oral eosinophilic granuloma ( linear granuloma ) in dogs occurs as a familial disease in young siberian huskies .
"rarely , oral and skin ulcers may occur , without evidence of concurrent respiratory tract infection .",microscopic lesions are characterized by foci of cytoplasmic vacuolation in squamous epithelium that evolve into areas of necrosis and ulceration .
"there is apparently a poor correlation between the levels of blood urea nitrogen and the development of uremic stomatitis , suggesting that other factors are involved in its pathogenesis .",this may elain why the lesions are mainly located where salivary ducts enter the oral cavity .
"microscopically , there is ulceration of the squamous mucosa with coagulation necrosis , and vesicle and pustule formation in the superficial epithelium of the rete pegs .",a pleocellular inflammatory reaction is evident in the connective tissue below the ulcers .
abscesses in the wall of the pharynx may result from necrosis of retropharyngeal lymph nodes .,"necrotic stomatitis with simple necrosis of the epithelium and lamina propria may be produced by thermal or chemical agencies , but in animals , it is usually caused by fusobacterium necrophorum and other anaerobes ."
it is also associated with necrotizing lesions elsewhere in the upper and lower alimentary tract and liver .,"wherever it occurs , it is usually a secondary invader following previous mucosal damage ."
"the infection also may be initiated in the gums about erupting teeth in any species , and by the trauma produced in baby pigs by removing the needle teeth .",the same syndrome is rather common in housed lambs as a complication of contagious ecthyma .
"the necrotic tissues are histologically structureless and are surrounded at first by a zone of vascular reaction , later by a dense but narrow rim of leukocytes , and later still by thick , encapsulating granulation tissue .","in time it may slough and leave deep ulcers , which may heal by granulation ."
"spread from the oral foci occurs down the trachea ( causing aspiration pneumonia ) , down the esophagus , and via blood vessels .","death may occur acutely in septicemia with only multiple small serosal hemorrhages as evidence , or metastases may occur in other tissue ."
"fusobacterium - yikt organisms are present in large numbers in a variety of organs , including the bone marrow .","in addition to the characteristic oral lesions , there is marked depletion of lymphoid tissues and necrotic enteritis ."
a gross diagnosis of oral necrobacillosis is ordinarily possible but may be confirmed by a smear from the margin of the lesion .,the organism is difficult to cultivate due to its strict anaerobiasis .
"in the deep layers of necrosis , fusiforms predominate , and toward the surface there is a variety of other organisms , chiefly cocci .","in the lesions , the spirochetes can be found in large numbers at the advancing margins as well as in peripheral viable tissue ."
it is intensely fetid and consists of a dirty necrotic pseudomembrane surrounded by a zone of acute inflammation .,"the necrotic tissue may slough to leave deep ulcers ; the cheek may be perforated to leave a gaping defect , or gangrene may supervene ."
"staphylococci may cause pyogranulomatous lesions ( botryomycosis ) in any species , especially mastitis in sows ( see the skin and appendages , volume , and the female genital system , volume ) .","actinomyces bovis , a gram - positive filamentous organism , causes pyogranulomatous mandibular and maxillary osteomyelitis in cattle ( see inflammatory diseases of bones , in bones and joints , volume ) and mastitis in sows ."
"here , trapped grass grains and awns may provoke the initial trauma .","lesions elsewhere in the soft tissue of the mouth may be attributed to disruption of the mucosa by similar types of insults and eruption of , or abrasion by , teeth ."
lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltrates are present in the surrounding reactive fibrous stroma or granulation tissue .,"an individual inflammatory focus appears grossly as a nodular , firm , pale , fibrous mass a few millimeters to cm in diameter , containing in the center minute yellow "" sulfur granules , "" which are the club colonies ."
"the cut surface of the node reveals small , soft yellow or orange granulomatous masses that project somewhat above the capsular contour and contain "" sulfur granules . ""","there is also sclerosing inflammation of the surrounding tissues , which may cause adhe - sion to overlying skin or mucous membranes ."
"the characteristic lesions in sheep occur in the subcutaneous tissue of the head , especially of the cheeks , nose , lips , submaxillary and throat regions , and on the nasal turbinates .","actinobacillosis may also occur sporadically or as outbreaks in sheep , but in this species the tongue seems to be exempt ."
"large numbers of gram - positive , filamentous , branching organisms , with longitudinal and transverse divisions , may be demonstrated in the necrotic centers of submucosal granulomas .","in cats , the organism is uncommonly associated with oral granulomas affecting especially the tongue and tonsillar crypt ."
"conditions in which such bacterial tonsillitis may occur include pasteurellosis in sheep and pigs , and necrobacillosis in all species .","this reaction is exaggerated and may be associated with ulceration of the crypt and suppuration of involuted tonsillar lymphoid tissue , in certain bacterial infections , causing the formation of visible yellowish nodules ."
"involution of b - dependent tonsillar lymphoid follicles due to viral lymphocytolysis may occur during the early phase of a number of lymphotropic diseases such as feline panleukopenia , canine parvovirus infection , canine distemper , bovine virus diarrhea , rinderpest , and swine vesicular disease .","numerous karyorrhexic nuclei , lymphocyte depletion , and prominent histiocytes signal such damage ."
"regional geographic differences exist in the prevalence of certain oral tumors , especially in dogs and cattle .",these differences may be related to types and levels of carcinogens in the environment and warrant further investigation from the point of view of comparative oncology .
"the most common types of malignant oral tumors in dogs and cats are , in order of their frequency , squamous - cell carcinomas , malignant melanomas ( in dogs only ) , and fibrosarcomas .","they vary considerably in their behavior , depending on species and location ."
"oral papillomas , due to bovine papillomavirus type , occur commonly in cattle .","their morphology and distribution are similar to the papillomas of dogs , and they are considered more fully under neoplasia of the esophagus and forestomachs ."
that develops by stromal metaplasia in ~ % of affected dogs .,there is no prognostic value in this distinction since these are all benign tumors that are cured by excision .
some of these neoplasms transform to squamous - cell carcinoma when they invade bone .,others have reported development of squamous - cell carcinoma at the site of irradiated acanthomatous epulis .
"most tumors of dental tissues are rare , nonmalignant , and infiltrative or eansive .","familiarity with dental embryology assists an understanding of the origin , appearance , and classification of the tumors discussed below ."
"because of their predominantly intraosseous location , they may destroy large amounts of bone and extend into the oral cavity or sinuses .","ameloblastomas occur at any age and originate from the dental lamina , the outer enamel epithelium , the dental follicle around retained unerupted teeth , the oral epithelium , or odontogenic epithelium in extraoral locations ."
"ameloblastic odontoma ( ameloblastic fibro - odontoma ) resembles ameloblastic fibroma but contains dentin and enamel , and the epithelium is more typical of the enamel organ .","it occurs in horses , cows , and dogs , often in immature animals ."
separate areas of ameloblastic epithelium are not present in complex and compound odontomas .,a tumor that contains areas of ameloblastic epithelium and areas of complex or compound odontoma is an odontoameloblastoma .
they are connected with existing dental alveoli and are detected when they bulge the contour of the host bone or interfere with other teeth .,odontomas are usually located in the mandibular or maxillary arch and are less rare in cattle and horses than in other species .
"in the dog , this tumor is second to melanoma in prevalence in the oral cavity .","it usually involves the tonsils , although the gingivae are common sites ."
"the large ones are extensively necrotic and putrid , and the teeth are lost or loosely embedded in the tumor .","these tumors of the maxilla rapidly fill the adjacent sinuses and cause bulging of the face and may extend further into the nasal , orbital , and cranial cavities ."
a similar association is made in the etiology of squamous carcinomas of the esophagus and forestomachs in cattle and is considered more fully under neoplasia of the esophagus and forestomachs .,"in cattle , oral squamous - cell carcinomas are very rare , with the exception of a few geographic foci where they are associated with oral papillomatosis and ingestion of bracken fern ."
"they grow rapidly ; necrosis and ulceration are common , and % metastasize to the regional lymph nodes , mainly the submandibular nodes .",they may spread via hematogenous and lymphatic routes to more distant sites .
"it occurs in a variety of conditions , including heavy - metal poisoning , poisoning with organophosphates , encephalitis , and most often , stomatitis .","decreased secretion of saliva is less common but accompanies fever , dehydration , and salivary gland disease ."
"most of them lodge at the orifice and cause some degree of salivary retention , glandular atrophy , and a predisposition to infection and further inflammation .","calculi are usually single and cylindric , and they may be quite large ."
their origin is presumably from rupture of the fine tortuous ducts of the dorsal part of the sublingual gland .,"small mucoceles , seldom exceeding cm in size , are occasionally observed on the side of the bovine tongue ."
"it appears that they arise most commonly from the sublingual salivary gland , either from individual units of the polystomatic portion or from the duct of the monostomatic portion .","zygomatic salivary mucoceles also occur , associated with local swelling and ehthalmos ."
their distinction is probably valid when no demonstrable connection occurs with a salivary duct and a pseudostratified columnar or stratified squamous lining epithelium is present .,"branchial cleft cysts may be located ventrolaterally , as are the salivary cysts , or dorsolaterally on the neck ."
"the infection usually gains entrance via the excretory duct , although the infection may be hematogenous or develops by local trauma .","sialoadenitis , inflammation of the salivary glands , is uncommon in animals though inflammation of the zygomatic gland in dogs is a cause of retrobulbar abscess ."
probably the most common associations with sialoadenitis in animals are strangles in horses and distemper in dogs .,"the lesions of malignant catarrhal fever , also specific in type , are described under infectious and parasitic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract ."
local invasion by tumors originating in adjacent tissue is more common than primary neoplasia .,only in dogs do salivary tumors occur often enough to permit a general statement .
"in most cases , the histogenesis can be recognized , the duct neoplasms being papillomatous if benign , and carcinomas squamous or mucoepidermoid if malignant .",salivary tumors have two main sites of origin within the gland : the ducts and the glandular tissue .
"the squamous mucosa is frequently eroded or ulcerated in viral diseases , with similar lesions elsewhere in the upper alimentary tract .",conditions of striated muscle such as nutritional myodegeneration and eosinophilic myositis will occur in the esophageal muscle of the ruminant .
"short , fibrous bands with a narrow , mucosa - lined lumen connecting an esophagus of normal diameter with trachea or bronchus are reported , as are small apertures connecting the lining of esophageal diverticula with the respiratory tree .","esophagorespiratory fistulas without esophageal atresia are more commonly recognized in animals , and in calves and dogs strong circumstantial evidence suggests that some of these are congenital ."
"gradual - pressure necrosis caused by an intraluminal mass and adhesion of esophagus to underlying trachea , or lung , with development of a fistula into the adjacent airway , creates the acquired communication .",this may be lined eventually by epithelium of esophageal or respiratory origin .
"traction diverticulum is the result of maturation of a periesophageal fibrous adhesion , following perforation and inflammation , drawing with it a pouch of esophageal mucosa that is usually small and inconsequential .","ingesta and foreign bodies may accumulate in diverticula , causing gradual enlargement , with the potential for local esophagitis , ulceration , and perforation or fistula formation ."
"parakeratotic thickening and basal hyperplasia of the epithelium should be considered indicative of response to epithelial injury , and in the distal esophagus of pigs it is a concomitant of ulceration of the pars esophagea of the stomach .",parakeratosis of the esophagus occurs in pigs with cutaneous parakeratosis of zinc deficiency .
"caustic or irritant chemicals , ionizing radiation , or hot ingesta may cause mucosal injury , the severity of which depends on the nature of the insult and duration of eure .",mild acute insult may result in diffuse or local reddening of the mucosa .
"relatively short duration of eure to re - fluxed gastric content is required to induce epithelial damage , signaled by hyperemia or linear erosions and ulcers , perhaps with superficial fibrinonecrotic debris , and erythematous margins .",stratified squamous epithelium appears more susceptible to the corrosive effects of gastric secretion than other types of mucosa in the lower gastrointestinal tract .
"the condition is probably secondary to other intercurrent problems , including antibiotic therapy , inanition , and possibly esophageal gastric reflux and is considered more fully under mycotic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract .","similarly , secondary zygomycotic granulomatous involvement of the esophagus is a rarely recorded complication of debilitating systemic disease states and heavy use of glucocorticoids and antibiotics ."
"alternatively , perforation of the thoracic esophagus may lead to sepsis of the pleural space , and pleuritis .","perforations of the pharyngoesophageal diverticulum above the cricoid cartilage , due to injuries caused by administration of medication by balling or drenching guns , or by passage of a stomach tube , probang , or endoscope may have similar consequences ."
"this results in entrapment and constriction of the esophagus between the heart and pulmonary artery ventrally , the anomalous right - sided aortic arch dorsally , and the ligamentum arteriosum or remnant of the ductus arteriosus on the left .","other vascular anomalies that may constrict the esophagus , and reported only in the dog , are persistence of both right and left aortic arches ; persistent right ductus arteriosus ; aberrant left subclavian artery , in association with persistent right aortic arch ; aberrant right subclavian artery , arising distal to the left subclavian artery and passing dorsally over the esophagus ."
constricting mural fibrosis or other causative internal or external obstructive lesions will be obvious .,"the mucosa at the site of stricture may be ulcerated , as the result of impaction of ingesta or as a sequel to antecedent esophagitis , pressure necrosis , or neoplasia ."
retropharyngeal abscesses and lesions of the equine guttural pouch may cause peripheral nerve damage and paralysis .,"rabies and brain abscess in all species , infectious bovine rhinotracheitis , and listeriosis in cattle are candidate central causes of pharyngeal paralysis ."
"this condition is recognized in the dog , but not the cat .","cricoesophageal incoordination or achalasia may impede the first stage of the esophageal phase of swallowing , the opening of the upper esophageal sphincter to accept the approaching bolus ."
"the striated esophageal muscle does not show consistent signs of neurogenic atrophy in idiopathic megaesophagus , and vagal stimulation causes contraction .",hence it is inferred that the lower motor unit is intact .
analagous idiopathic functional and morphologic defects may also develop in mature dogs .,"the condition appears to be heritable , with a pattern in miniature schnauzers compatible with a simple autosomal dominant , or a % penetrance autosomal recessive mode of inheritance ."
"dilation of the anterior portion , with a normal or thickened caudal thoracic esophagus , was found in two cases .","several foals have been reported with esophageal dilatation or ectasia , apparently congenital ."
"the species producing large esophageal cysts and similar large cysts in skeletal muscle is spread by cats , where gametogony and sporogony occur in the lamina propria of the small intestine .",other species of microscopic sarcocysts also may be encountered in esophageal striated muscle .
hypoderma assumes significance in a small proportion of animals treated with systemic organophosphate insecticides while larvae reside in the esophageal wall .,"the easily overlooked translucent larvae may be only mm in length , but they instigate local hemorrhage and neutrophil infiltration ."
"following months in an inflammatory granuloma in the aortic adventitia , worms migrate to the subjacent esophagus , where they develop to adulthood in the submucosa and perforate the epithelium .","larvae that adopt aberrant migratory pathways may be found in granulomas in sites such as the subcutis , bladder , and kidney as well as stomach and intrathoracic locations ."
"the granulomas around spirocerca contain highly reactive pleomorphic fibroblasts with large , open nuclei and numerous mitotic figures .","neoplasms arising from such lesions have cytologic characteristics typical of fibrosarcoma and osteosarcoma with local tissue invasion and , in many cases , pulmonary metastasis ."
the importance of closely examining the rumen contents is often overlooked during routine autopsy .,"the first , and sometimes only , indication of the presence of certain toxic substances may be provided by the odor and appearance of the rumen content ."
subsequent development of the ruminal papillae depends mainly on the type of diet fed .,"the ruminal papillae in the newborn are rudimentary , which gives the mucosa a relatively smooth and pale appearance ."
the animal and vegetable hairs in barley rations may provide the portal of entry for bacteria that cause the mild rumenitis and microabscesses in the ruminal wall .,hyperkeratosis of the ruminal epithelium also occurs in calves deficient in vitamin a .
the ruminal mucosa usually sloughs within a few hours after death .,"it separates from the lamina propria in large gray patches , which cover the ingesta when the rumen is opened ."
"tympanitic distension of the forestomachs may be acute , or chronic and recurrent , and there is a basic distinction between the two .","the acute tympany of cattle fed legumes is characterized by foaming of the rumen contents , whereas in chronic or recurrent tympany the gas is free but retained because of some physical or functional defect of eructation ."
"( f ) clubbing and adhesion of rumen papillae with parakeratotic epithelium , associated with feeding a ration high in barley .",congestion of esophagus and connective tissue cranial to thoracic inlet and blanching of esophagus caudal to thoracic inlet .
"combination of salivary bicarbonate with organic acids such as citric , malonic , and succinic acids , which are present in high levels in legumes , results in the production of large amounts of carbon dioxide , enhancing bubble formation .",carbon dioxide accounts for to % of the total gas produced in the rumen .
the parotid and submaxillary glands produce saliva with a high concentration of mucins .,the levels of the various pro - and antifoaming compounds in saliva are dependent on the gland of origin .
these bacteria are also often mucinolytic and may destroy the salivary mucins .,"perhaps this elains the more gradual onset of feedlot bloat , since it takes time for the ruminal flora to change ."
the lungs are compressed into the anterior thorax by the bulging diaphragm .,blood clots are frequently seen in the bronchi and paranasal and frontal sinuses .
functional causes of secondary tympany include organophosphate intoxication and vagal damage due to adhesion or lymphosarcomatous infiltrates .,"the more common physical problems include obstructions of the esophagus or esophageal groove by tumor , papilloma , or foreign body ; reticular adhesions ; and esophageal stenosis of any cause ."
"the bacterial infections are characterized by typical muscle lesions in the case of blackleg and malignant edema , and","none of these conditions has lesions associated with the redistribution of abdominal blood flow , nor are the rumen contents foamy ."
extraruminal lesions must be present to establish a diagnosis of bloat .,postmortem distention of the rumen must not be mistaken for antemortem tympany .
it is possible that many of the lighter and smaller foreign bodies are regurgitated .,"in consequence , a large proportion of adult cattle , and very few goats or sheep , have foreign bodies in the rumen and reticulum but rarely in the omasum ."
the sequel to penetration by sharp objects in adult cattle is traumatic reticuloperitonitis .,"a mixed bacterial flora containing clostridia is responsible , presumably following mucosal trauma ."
"if the foreign body is short or bent , it may progress no further , and some foreign bodies are apparently withdrawn with the reticular movement ; in such instances a chronic local peritonitis with adhesions develops .",the perforation is usually in the antero ventral direction and is followed immediately by an acute local peritonitis .
right lateral deviation of the penetrating agent causes involvement of the wall of the abomasum .,"it is unusual for the liver or spleen to be penetrated , but metastatic abscesses in the liver are common ."
"further progression of the foreign body is ordinarily slow and produces a canal surrounded by chronic granulation tissue and containing , besides the foreign body , ingesta , purulent exudate , and detritus .","the bacteria commonly active in the tract are corynebacterium pyogenes , fusobacterium necrophorum , and a variety of putrefactive types ."
"frequently , these magnets are found incidentally in the reticulum , completely covered with metal foreign bodies , including nails and wires , which might otherwise have penetrated the reticular wall .","the prophylactic use of magnets has become common practice in many herds , and this probably contributes to the marked decrease in fatal cases ."
"although the acute local peritonitis causes immediate cessation of ruminal movements , a persistent ruminal atony or inactivity may ensue .","one of the variants in the usual pattern of migration of the foreign body is penetration of the side of the reticulum , leading to a suppurative inflammation in the grooves between the reticulum , omasum , and abomasum ."
the rumen is distended with enough fluid to cause sloshing if the carcass is jolted .,"there is no ruminal fermentation or odor , and bits of unmacerated straw and food particles float on the watery fluid ."
"a diagnosis of vagal indigestion at autopsy is orinarily dependent on evidence of abnormal abomasal , omasal , or reticuloruminal motility , in association with morphologic lesions of the vagus nerves , or adhesion involving the forestomachs and abomasum .","in other cases , degeneration of the vagus is not evident , and the dysfunction and lesions are more likely to be due to peritonitis and the subsequent abscessation or adhesions that interfere with normal motility of the forestomachs and the abomasum ."
sudden changes from concentrates with lower energy values to those with higher values may predispose to acidosis .,"even after cattle are accustomed to high concentrate rations , they may still develop ruminal acidosis ."
"the production of the latter increases after there has been a marked change in the ruminal flora , which is very responsive to the substrate available for fermentation .","the normal ph of ruminal fluid in cattle and sheep varies between and , depending on the diet fed ."
"there is a reduction in plasma volume ; hemoconcentration , anuria , and circulatory collapse follow .","this results in movement of fluid from the blood into the rumen , producing bulky and liquid ruminal contents and severe dehydration ."
"if treatment of the initial fluid imbalance is delayed , death may occur in a week or so from ischemic renal cortical necrosis .","a temporary recovery may be followed by what appears clinically to be a relapse in acidosis , but which is a developing mycotic rumenitis ."
"however , the d isomer of lactic acid is poorly metabolized by the host and hence accumulates eventually to a much higher concentration in plasma than the l isomer .",almost equal concentrations of d and l isomers of lactic acid are produced in the rumen .
"the protozoa appear to be particularly sensitive , but many types of bacteria are also lost .","therefore , in animals that show signs of immediate recovery , with or without therapeutic aid , the reestablishment of normal fermentation reactions may be delayed ."
"although the ruminal contents may appear relatively normal in more advanced cases of acidosis , the intestinal contents tend to remain very watery .",absence of protozoa is consistent with chemical rumenitis but is also influenced by the interval between death and the postmortem examination .
"when the epithelium is detached , the lamina propria is seen to be hyperemic in patches .","there may be a slight , poorly defined bluish coloration in the ventral sac of the rumen and reticulum and in the omasum , visible through the serosa ."
"there is marked cytoplasmic vacuolation of the epithelial cells , often leading to vesiculation .",a mild to marked neutrophilic reaction is evident in the mucosa and submucosa ( fig .
"necrobacillary rumenitis is common in feedlot cattle , probably a product of mild acidosis following a too rapid introduction to a high - concentrate ration .",invasion of the wall of the rumen probably does not occur with significant frequency unless a foothold is provided by the superficial necrosis and inflammation of acidosis .
"the regenerated epithelium is flat and white , and the specialized villi do not completely return .","if the animal recovers from the immediate effects of overeating , the necrotic epithelium sloughs , the ulcer contracts , and epithelial regeneration begins from the margins ."
"it is unusual for ruminal necrobacillosis in cattle to be more than a superficial infection , and although the muscle layers are involved in the inflammation , they are not ordinarily invaded by the organism .",infection of the omasum differs in that perforation of the omasal leaves is common .
"the fungi , which are opportunists like fusobacterium necrophorum , are usually members of the genera mucor , rhizopus , and absidia , and these cannot be differentiated from each other in histologic sections .","when inflammation in the wall of the forestomachs extends to the serosa and is hemorrhagic , mycotic infection should be suspected ."
"in fatal cases , most of the ventral sac and parts of the omasum are involved .","the lesions are very striking and suggest on initial inspection that the walls have been massively infarcted , which in part they have ( fig ."
"histologically , the rumenitis is characterized by hemorrhagic necrosis of all structures in the wall , by copious fibrinous exudate , and by rather scant leukocytic reaction .","on the inner surface of the rumen , the lesions are more hemorrhagic than those of necrobacillosis , and often more irregular in outline , and the necrotic epithelium is difficult to detach ."
"microscopically , there is neuronal degeneration of the middle laminae of the cerebral cortex and perivascular edema .","the cerebellar vermis prolapses into the fourth ventricle , and there is coning of the cerebellum into the foramen magnum ."
"myiasis of the rumen caused by larvae of the "" screwworm "" fly cochliomyia hominivorax is occasionally a cause of mortality in young calves in south america .",the larvae are pre - sumed to be licked from cutaneous wounds and swallowed .
"some form flattened sessile hyperplastic epithelial plaques , while others , usually limited to the esophagus , form fibropapillomas .","they are composed of a number of closely packed fronds of squamous epithelium , each supported by a light core of fibrous stroma and arising from a common fibrous base ."
"esophageal and ruminal carcinomas are associated with dysphagia or difficult deglutition , rumen tympany , and apparent abdominal pain with progressive cachexia .","concurrent papillomas , carcinomas , and hemangiomas of the bladder like those causing enzootic hematuria are often found in cattle with esophageal or ruminal cancer ."
"microscopically , they are typical squamous - cell carcinomas and invade locally , causing induration of the wall of the organ .",they may metastasize to local lymph nodes and to distant sites such as liver and lung .
"in horses , squamous - cell carcinomas of the stomach may also involve the adjacent terminal esophagus .","squamous - cell carcinomas may also be encountered rarely in the esophagus of cats , where they develop in the distal portion , forming proliferative plaques of neoplastic cells that eventually ulcerate and invade the wall of the esophagus and adjacent mediastinum ."
occasional involvement of the omasum and reticulum by direct extension from adjacent affected abomasum may occur in cattle with lymphosarcoma .,"invasion of or metastasis to the canine esophagus by thyroid , respiratory , and gastric carcinomas is also reported ."
"chronic inflammatory infiltrates and lymphoid follicles are normally present in the lamina propria and submucosa of the cardiac gland mucosa abutting the esophageal region , especially in the pig .",the pars esophagea of the stomach of the pig is a rectangular area around the cardia .
"endocrine cells usually abut the basement membrane of the gland , lack eure to the gland lumen , and have characteristic basal granules visible in thin , plastic - embedded sections .","the chief cells are apparently long - lived cells , probably derived from stem cells at the isthmus , but possibly autonomously replicative at a slow rate ."
"the fundic mucosa of newborn ruminants and , especially , piglets may be relatively poorly differentiated and proliferative .","under normal circumstances , mitotic figures are not commonly encountered in cells at the isthmus of fundic glands , and virtually never at any distance from the isthmus ."
"the tubular glands of the pyloric mucosa open into deep gastric pits , which may extend half the thickness of the mucosa .","the glands are lined by pale mucous cells , with interspersed endocrine elements , mainly g ( gastrin ) and d ( somatostatin ) cells ."
"normally , relatively few lymphocytes and plasma cells and scattered mast cells are present , mainly deep between glands .","occasional lymphocytic nodules or follicles may be present , usually near the muscularis mucosae ."
"secretion of acid ( and intrinsic factor ) is the function of the oxyntic or parietal cells , about one billion of which are present in the stomach of a - kg dog .","the major function of the stomach , hydrolysis of protein in preparation for subsequent intestinal digestion and absorption , is accomplished by acid and pepsin , activated by autocatalysis from pepsinogen at low ph ."
"histamine , probably derived from mast cells in the lamina propria , and possibly from local enteroendocrine cells , is a paracrine permissive stimulant , continuously present in the environment of the oxyntic cells .","evidence for a stimulus causing a phasic increase in histamine effects on parietal cells is not available , though it is suggested that gastrin may promote histamine release in some species ."
"acetylcholine , the neurocrine agonist , is released near the oxyntic cell from processes of parasympathetic postganglionic neurons .","its release is both background and phasic , being enhanced by vagal activity during the central stimulation of the cephalic phase - the pavlovian response ."
"in addition , gastrin has an important trophic effect on parietal cell mass , stimulating synthesis of nucleic acid and protein and increasing the number of parietal cells in fundic mucosa .",this probably elains its contribution to phasic acid secretion in the intact animal .
"by this means , bicarbonate secretion of relatively small magnitude in relation to total acid secretion may hypothetically protect the mucosa against attack by acid .","here a sharp ph gradient is maintained , neutral on the cell - surface side , acid on the luminal side ."
"the high metabolic rate of the gastric mucosa requires a high blood flow to maintain an intact surface epithelium and eerimentally , increased perfusion is protective against a number of significant mucosal insults .","in some species , prostacyclin ( pgi ) and prostaglandins of the e and a series cause vasodilation and increased blood flow in addition to inhibiting acid secretion ."
"the progenitor cells of the fundic mucosa have the potential to produce tall columnar mucous cells of the foveolar or surface type , to produce mucous neck cells , and presumably by further differentiation , to evolve parietal cells .","atrophy of parietal cell mass without extensive mucous - cell hyperplasia occurs in animals , particularly ruminants , that have signs of gastrointestinal disease including inappetence ."
"as the lesion evolves , parietal cells are present only in the basal portion of the glands , and they appear to be progressively displaced by hyperplastic mucous cells .",chronic inflammation in the fundic stomach in all species is associated with the development of mucous metaplasia and hyperplasia of glands in the vicinity of inflammatory foci .
"in established lesions , columnar mucous cells with regular nuclear polarity , similar to foveolar mucous cells , may be present .","when inflammatory infiltrates are local , the mucous change is limited to a few surrounding glands ."
"secretion of lysozyme , and of secretory piece and iga , are properties of mucous neck cells in gastritis in humans .",cell - mediated immune events in the lamina propria of the small intestine are increasingly implicated in altered proliferation and differentiation of enteric epithelium by as yet undefined mechanisms .
"at least in ostertag ia - induced gastritis , it occurs in the face of gastrin concentrations many times above normal levels , which are not simply the result of achlorhydria and failure of suppression of g - cell secretion by antral acidification .",such atrophy of the parietal cells and mucous metaplasia and hyperplasia apparently do not result from withdrawal of the trophic stimulus of gastrin .
"the specific agency most commonly recognized is gastric parasitism by nematodes such as ostertagia spp . , trichostrongylusaxei , and hyostrongylus rubidus , where the distribution of the lesion is closely related to the physical presence of nematodes and to the interstitial inflammatory reaction they incite .","mucous metaplasia and hyperplasia are also typically present around the healing margins of chronic ulcers , perhaps in response to local inflammation ."
"though the surface may be glistening , profuse mucus secretion is not usually obvious .","the surface of the stomach is usually paler than normal in affected areas ; however , local congestion or hyperemia may be evident ."
it may eliminate the threat of local acid corrosion and promote the transfer into the lumen of protective soluble factors such as lysozyme and iga or its analogs .,"replacement of parietal cells by mucous neck cells , or an apparently more fully differentiated mucous cell in chronic gastritis , may be a protective response ."
postmortem rupture of the dilated stomach is common and must be differentiated .,"there may be congestion of the cervical esophagus and blanching of the thoracic esophagus , producing a prominent "" bloat line . """
"beyond that , hereditary factors , management , behavior , and type of feed may contribute in obscure ways to the development of dilation .","in dogs , gastric dilatation and volvulus is usually a problem associated with overeating and probably aerophagia , especially in the deep - chested breeds such as great danes , st . bernards , irish setters , wolfhounds , borzois , and bloodhounds ."
"the mucosa and , usually , the full thickness of the gastric wall are edematous and dark red to black , and there is bloody content in the lumen of the stomach .",venous infarction of the gastric mucosa ensues as volvulus progressively constricts venous outflow from the stomach .
endotoxemia is implicated speculatively in disseminated intravascular coagulation and may contribute to shock .,"obstruction of veins by volvulus and pressure exerted by the distended stomach result in decreased venous return via the portal vein and posterior vena cava , causing reduced cardiac output and circulatory shock ."
left displacement of the gas - filled abomasum is amenable to treatment and is rarely encountered at autopsy .,handling of an affected animal postmortem may correct displacements in any case .
"accumulation of considerable amounts of fine sand may occur in the abomasum , apparently with little ill effect .","hair balls are often found in the stomach of longhaired cats , and in calves reared on diets low in roughage , where most are in the rumen , with a few in the abomasum ."
gastric impaction by inspissated content is reported in the horse as a clinical problem of unknown cause .,"it causes severe abdominal pain and is to be differentiated clinically and at autopsy from gastric dilation secondary to intestinal obstruction , and from primary gastric dilation due to ingestion of excess fermentable carbohydrate ."
"the abomasum is impacted with inspissated coarse ingesta , despite an apparently patent pylorus .","metabolic derangement due to sequestration of chloride in the rumen following regurgitation from the obstructed abomasum , and hypokalemia due to decreased intake in feed in the face of continued normal renal excretion , place these animals in perilous physiologic circumstances before inanition becomes a significant factor ."
"focal hyperemia may be related to local irritation of the mucosa by foreign bodies , and with focal acute viral lesions of the abomasum in cattle .","it usually coexists in these circumstances with superficial erosion , which is discussed later with gastric ulcer ."
"lesions vary in severity from case to case , and premonitory changes without severe hemorrhage and necrosis are present in animals euthanized earlier in the course of disease .","in such dogs there may be no gross gastric lesion , or variable edema and thickening of rugal mucosa , perhaps with focal ulceration ."
impaired renal degradation and excretion of gastrin may promote hyperchlorhydria and exacerbate mucosal damage .,microvascular lesions in the lamina propria and systemic states in uremia may be contributory .
"mineral deposition is probably the product of altered systemic metabolism of calcium in renal failure , perhaps coupled with the local microenvironment resulting from bicarbonate moving across the basal border of secreting parietal cells .","membrane lesions in metabolically compromised parietal cells may also act as foci of mineral deposition ( see the urinary system , this volume , for discussion of uremia ) ."
"in section there is thrombosis of venules in the mucosa and often at the mucosal - submucosal junction , usually with prominent fibrin plugs .","occasionally , the superficial mucosa is obviously necrotic and may lift off with the ingesta ."
edema may contribute to the thickening of rugae seen in gastritis .,edema fluid collects in the submucosa of the folds and is particularly obvious in the normally thin abomasal plicae .
"gastritis is a poorly defined term often applied to acute gastric injury with grossly visible hemorrhage or erosion , when inflammatory processes , strictly speaking , are scarcely present .","the differential considerations in diffuse gastric hemorrhage , and the etiopathogenesis of mucosal erosion will be considered later , with ulcer ."
"atrophy of parietal cell mass , associated with autoimmune phenomena and the development of pernicious anemia , does not occur spontaneously in animals , though it can be induced in dogs by immunization with gastric juice .",chronic antritis with reduced gastrin secretion theoretically might result in atrophy of parietal cell mass .
the stomach in dogs is involved very uncommonly in eosinophilic gastroenteritis .,"eosinophils may infiltrate the mucosa and submucosa in large numbers , in association with a syndrome of protein loss , eosinophilia , and eosinophilic infiltrates in more distal gut ( see diseases of the intestine , below ) ."
"microscopically , these areas are composed of hyperplastic mucosa , which may or may not include secondary folds of muscularis mucosa and submucosa .",grossly thickened folds of gastric mucosa over an area or cm in diameter are thrown up in a convoluted pattern that may resemble cerebral gyri .
abomasal lesions are rarely the sole manifestation of these diseases but form part of a picture at autopsy that may suggest an etiologic diagnosis .,"the appearance and pathogenesis of abomasitis in these diseases varies with the conditions , which are discussed in detail under infectious and parasitic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract ."
"mycotic gastritis is a sporadic problem almost invariably secondary to insults that cause achlorhydria ( or focal atrophy ) , necrosis , or ulceration under conditions where mycotic colonization can occur .","compromised resistance , perhaps associated with neoplasia , endogenous or egenous steroids , lympholytic viral disease , and altered gastrointestinal flora due to antiobiotic therapy , may further promote mycosis ."
mycotic abomasitis in calves is secondary to gastrointestinal infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and to venous infarction of the mucosa in endotoxemia or septicemia with e . coli or salmonella .,"bovine virus diarrhea and , occasionally , gastric ulcer provide conditions for mycotic invasion of the abomasum in older cattle ."
mycosis of the glandular stomach of horses and pigs is virtually unknown .,"in dogs , rare cases of acute multifocal infarctive or granulomatous gastritis are reported , associated with zygomycetes ."
and cylicospirura felineus are found in nodules in the gastric wall .,"ollulanus tricuspis is found on the mucosa of the stomach in cats , where it may cause mild to , rarely , severe chronic gastritis ."
"it resolves into a relative imbalance between the necrotizing effects of gastric acid and pepsin on one hand , and the ability of the mucosa to maintain its integrity on the other .","hypersecretion of acid , or impairment of mucosal integrity in the face of normal acid secretion , may be invoked as general mechanisms ."
"factors implicated in hypersecretion of acid include abnormally high basal secretion , possibly associated with an eanded parietal cell mass , perhaps the result of increased trophic stimulation by gastrin .","gastrinomas cause the zollinger - ellison syndrome , characterized by elevated gastric acid secretion and severe gastroduodenal ulceration ."
"ulceration due to compromise of mucosal protective mechanisms is attributed to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents such as aspirin , phenylbutazone , and indomethacin .",the therapeutic and ulcerogenic properties of these drugs reside largely in their effects on prostaglandin metabolism .
"under some eerimental conditions , acid back diffusion into the gastric mucosa , and morphologic damage , have been caused by application of bile salts .",reflux of duodenal contents containing bile salts has been implicated in the induction of gastritis and gastric ulcer .
"reduced mucosal perfusion or ischemia may be a principal factor interacting in stress - associated ulceration , and in that initiated by other modalities discussed previously .","reduced blood flow to the mucosa in local areas has been suspected , under a number of circumstances , to precede mucosal hemorrhage or erosion ."
"the microscopic lesion associated with hemorrhage of this type is often subtle , bleeding seemingly resulting from diapedesis , with minimal mucosal damage .","in some instances , melena , presumably the result of a recent episode of gastric bleeding , may be present in the lower intestine , with minimal gross evidence of hemorrhage or ulceration in the stomach ."
lesions of any genesis proceeding to gastric ulcer do so by progressive coagulation necrosis of the gastric wall .,"ulcers vary in microscopic appearance depending on their aggression , and the point in their development at which they are intercepted ."
"ulcers that come into equilibrium with reparative processes may do so at any level of the gastric wall below the mucosa , but usually at the submucosa .","subacute to chronic ulcers are typified by a base and sides composed of granulation tissue of varying thickness and maturity , infiltrated by a mixed inflammatory cell population , and overlain by a usually thin layer of necrotic debris ."
"duodenal ulcers , which usually occur proximal to the open - ing of the pancreatic and bile ducts , resemble gastric ulcer in their pathogenesis , microscopic appearance ( allowing for their intestinal location ) , evolution , and sequelae .","peptic ulcer occurs commonly in cattle , uncommonly in dogs , rarely in cats , and is unusual in horses and swine , where ulceration of the esophageal , rather than glandular , gastric mucosa is the rule ."
thrombosed arterioles and venules cut by the ulcerative process are often seen and should be sought in the bed of gastric and duodenal lesions associated with anemia or obvious hemorrhage .,"the gross and microscopic appearance of ulcers vary with their aggressiveness and duration , as previously described ."
"the irritant nature of gastric contents released in these circumstances may lead to chronic inflammation , granulation , and thickening of the serosa , even when previous perforation cannot be appreciated .","some ulcers perforate silently , the serosal lesion healing by granulation , or adhesion by , and fibroplasia in , the omentum ."
"the tumor and mastocytosis do not involve the stomach directly , and ulcers may occur in animals with solitary skin tumors .","in one series of dogs with recurrent or metastatic mastocytoma , gastric and duodenal erosions or ulcers , frequently multiple , were present in ."
"the microscopic appearance of these islet - cell tumors is not diagnostic for gastrinoma , nor is the ultrastructural appearance of tumor cells necessarily characteristic of the g cell .",pancreatic islet - cell neoplasms may be difficult to find and should be sought assiduously in suspect cases .
"they are present usually as linear areas of brown or black hemorrhage or erosion along the margins of abomasal rugae , or as punctate hemorrhages and erosions scattered over the mucosa , especially of the fundus .",such lesions must be differentiated from foci of acute necrosis and ulceration due to systemic viral infections .
"in feedlot animals in one study , a prevalence of abomasal ulcer of about to % was described , with about half the cases having clinical signs .",bleeding abomasal ulcer or perforation and septic peritonitis are the usual cause of death due to abomasal ulcers .
"some appear to occur under stressful circumstances , as in weaned calves or after transportation .",lactic acid and histamine entering the abomasum from the forestomachs in animals poorly adapted to high - concentrate rations may contribute to mucosal damage .
"bleeding abomasal ulcer should be sought in cattle with melena or anemia , and perforating abomasal ulcer in animals presenting with septic peritonitis , especially if digesta is in the abdominal cavity .",some points of perforation will be adherent to the abdominal wall or occluded by superficially adherent omentum .
gastric ulcer in swine is usually restricted to the pars esophagea ( fig .,. 1 0 d - f ) ; in a small proportion of affected pigs lesions extend into the contiguous esophagus .
"despite its high subclinical prevalence , and occasional outbreaks of clinical disease or loss of individual valuable pigs , most studies indicate that the economic significance of gastric ulceration is marginal .",little or no effect on growth rate or feed efficiency is evident in most subclinically affected animals .
"the lesion evolves through parakeratosis , to fissuring and erosion , with ultimate ulceration in severe cases .","lesions of the pars esophagea may involve only a small part , or virtually all , of the gastric squamous mucosa ."
"fatal gastric hemorrhage often occurs , and thrombosed arterioles and venules cut by ulceration are eed in the floor of the acute ulcer , which is often overlain by a blood clot .","ulcers of the pars esophagea usually involve only the submucosa , but they may advance to the muscularis externa and occasionally to the serosa ."
"repeatedly , finely ground rations have been found to be ulcerogenic and are the single most important contributing factor .","squamous epithelium has no innate buffering capacity , and it is highly susceptible to attack by gastric acid , as occurs in reflux esophagitis ."
"gastric ulcer as a clinical entity is less commonly recognized , though a syndrome of abdominal pain , in some cases associated with gastric reflux , has been described .","in horses , ulcers in the stomach of foals and adults are often found at autopsy incidental to some other disease process ."
perforation may occur at any site of ulceration and in one series represented % of autopsies on foals .,pyloric and duodenal stenosis have been associated with healing ulcers in horses .
surface proliferation or irregularity other than ulceration is very uncommon in gastric carcinoma in dogs .,ulceration is eected in more than half of canine gastric adenocarcinomas .
"they retain this form with some variation as they infiltrate and metastasize , and they are relatively less scirrhous than the diffuse type .","there may be papilliform infoldings of the epithelium of tubular adenocarcinomas ; some form smaller acinar structures ; others rarely adopt a more solid form of growth , with occasional acinar structures and a more anaplastic cytologic appearance ."
these have been alluded to previously as a potential cause of pyloric stenosis or obstruction and as a possible hyperplastic sequel to chronic antritis .,"their exact status , whether inflammatory hyperplasia or benign neoplasia , is unclear ."
"several cases of gastric adenocarcinoma have been described , adopting tubular and diffuse patterns .","tumors other than lymphosarcoma are rarely encountered in the stomach of cats , and even that is uncommon ."
"diffuse lesions , thickening the gastric wall , frequently ulcerate and hemorrhage from such ulcers , producing melena .","the lymphoid infiltrates are recognizable as firm , gray - white tissue in the submucosa and mucosa ."
"they induce desmoplasia , imparting a scirrhous , firm texture and appearance to the thickened gastric wall and to the peritoneal and pleural implants .","microscopically , these neoplasms are typical squamous - cell carcinomas , invading in cords or nests of cells through the gastric wall ."
"the length and shape of villi in "" n o r m a l "" animals varies with the species , age , intestinal microflora , and immune status .","in most species , villi are tallest in the duodenum and decline somewhat in height toward the ileum ."
"these are straight or somewhat coiled ( depending on the species and the proliferative status ) , glandlike structures , lined by a single layer of epithelium .",opening onto the mucosal surface around the base of each villus are several crypts of lieberkiihn .
one of the ensuing daughter cells usually differentiates and moves into the functional compartment of absorptive enterocytes on the villus .,"poorly differentiated cuboidal or low columnar cells with relatively few , short microvilli are the predominant type of cell lining crypts ; especially in the lower half of crypts , these cells form a population that cycles rapidly , undergoing amplification division ."
"it probably serves to "" insulate "" the surface from organisms , which it may entrap or immobilize .","the precise function of intestinal mucus , which stains strongly for neutral and sialic acid - rich mucosubstances , is uncertain ."
the fourth type of cell found in intestinal crypts is the enteroendocrine cell .,they too are derived from crypt stem cells and comprise a heterogenous population of about a dozen amine - or peptide - secreting endocrine / paracrine cells .
"these are flask - shaped cells tapering toward the luminal border , also found in other gastrointestinal and respiratory epithelial surfaces .","they are characterized by the presence of an apical tubulovesicular system , from which they derive their name , but the function of these cells is not known ."
"absorptive epithelial cells lie on a basal lamina , which they may produce .","the basolateral cell membrane is the site of ( na + , k + ) - atpase activity , driving the sodium pump , and of carrier systems erting monosaccharides from the cell ."
"the plasmalemma of microvilli is studded with massive numbers of enzyme molecules , including aminopeptidases and disaccharidases involved in terminal digestion of peptides and carbohydrates .","these protrude as minute knoblike structures into the glycoprotein "" glycocalyx , "" which coats the surface of microvilli ."
". 3 4 b ) , not in the duodenum , and seems to be a function of cell age .",such vacuolation should be differentiated from the presence of eosinophilic colostrum present in cytoplasmic vacuoles in the epithelial cells of neonates ( fig .
"the complex of endoplasmic membranes and golgi apparatus is active particularly in handling absorbed lipid , which diffuses from micelles at the cell surface , through the apical membrane , in the form of long - chain fatty acids or monoglyceride .","these are reesterified to triglyceride , appearing in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum , and are complexed with apoproteins produced in the rough endoplasmic reticulum , to be excreted via the golgi apparatus through the basolateral cell membrane as chylomicrons ."
"proliferation of elements of this sheath has been demonstrated around the crypt , and [ h ] thymidine - labeled mesenchymal cells appear to move in concert with overlying epithelium up onto villi , ultimately undergoing degeneration in the lamina propria at the villus tip .","there , histiocytes containing nuclear fragments may be found , presumably phagocytosing effete sheath cells ."
"globule leukocytes may be found in the epithelium of crypts and low on villi , or sometimes in the lamina propria between crypts .",plasma cells normally are not numerous in villi but are concentrated in the lamina propria between the upper portions of crypts .
"the majority pass up the centers of villi , arborizing near the villus tip into a dense capillary plexus that lies immediately beneath the basal lamina of the epithelium .","the vascular supply to the mucosa arises in submucosal arteries , which give off arterioles at right angles , some of which send branches to a capillary plexus around crypts of lieberkuhn ."
thus a putative cryptvillus fluid and electrolyte circuit would be provided with a direct vascular arm .,"anastomoses between capillary plexuses surrounding the villi and crypts might provide a mechanism for shunting electrolytes and water , just absorbed in the villi , into the vicinity of crypts , where secretion is occurring ."
production of volatile fatty acid from carbohydrate by colonic flora occurs in all species .,"the anatomy and size of the cecum and colon vary widely among domestic animals , depending largely on the significance of microbial fermentation of carbohydrate in the hindgut ."
"these cells have sparser and fewer regular microvilli in comparison with absorptive cells of the small bowel , and numerous glycoprotein - laden vesicles are in the apical cytoplasm .",the surface of the hindgut is lined by a single layer of tall columnar absorptive epithelial cells with basal nuclei .
these cells differentiate progressively toward absorptive epithelium as they approach the surface .,"stem cells are present in the base of the gland , and poorly differentiated mitotic columnar epithelium may be present in the basal two - thirds of the gland , though its extent may vary considerably ."
a fibroblast sheath encloses the colonic glands and appears to migrate with the epithelium .,"normally , relatively few inflammatory and immune - active cells are present in the superficial mucosa ; most plasma cells and lymphocytes are between deeper portions of glands ."
the leakiness of the epithelium of the small bowel ensures that the intestinal content is approximately isosmolal with the interstitial fluid space .,"the leaks in the small intestinal epithelium are paracellular , at the tight junctions , and act as water - filled spaces - 0.8 nm in diameter ."
"sodium ion enters the cell from the luminal solution down an electrostatic and concentration gradient established by the sodium pump , which exchanges k + for na + , but not at an equal rate .","the first mechanism involves independent , or uncoupled , electrogenic n a + absorption ."
"since cell membranes and junctional complexes are highly permeable to water , movement is rapid via both transcellular and paracellular routes , and differences in osmotic pressure between lumen and lateral intercellular space are small .","absorbed solute and water in isotonic proportions move into the interstitium of the villus , where within a few micrometers , they encounter a subepithelial capillary or lacteal ."
"therefore , it is not surprising that the epithelium and associated lymphoid and inflammatory cells in the mucosa and submucosa have evolved a complex system for sampling , blocking , neutralizing , and eliminating antigens .",lymphoid tissue has been estimated to constitute % of the intestinal mucosal mass and to exceed that of the spleen in volume .
permeability of the gut to macromolecules is the result of energy - dependent pinocytosis by the apical cell membrane at the base of microvilli .,"the selectivity of macromolecular transfer varies with the species , being least specific in neonatal ruminants , piglets , and foals , which take up most macromolecules contacting the epithelium ."
macromolecules gaining entry to the portal circulation are largely phagocytosed by kupffer cells in the liver .,this is presumably one mechanism by which antigens encounter immune - active cells in the mucosa .
"the m cells are present , interspersed among cells resembling absorptive enterocytes , on the surface of the "" d o m e ' ' in the mucosa overlying lymphoid aggregates in the submucosa .","the m cells are called so because of the presence of microfolds , rather than microvilli , on their apical surface in humans , though this characteristic seems to be restricted to that species ."
"the aggregated lymphoid follicles , or peyer ' s patches , and solitary lymphoid follicles are scattered in the mucosa of the small intestine of all species , and solitary lymphoid follicles stud the colonic mucosa .","peyer ' s patches are present throughout the length of the small intestine in all species , though they tend to be larger distally ."
"peyer ' s patches are comprised of follicular aggregates of b lymphocytes in the submucosa , underlying a discontinuous muscularis mucosae .",between the upper borders of adjacent lymphoid follicles are aggregates of t lymphocytes .
"how or whether antigen is processed in peyer ' s patches is unclear ; macrophages apparently are present in lower concentration in peyer ' s patches than in lamina propria , and their place in the interaction among m cells and t and b lymphocytes is uncertain .","they probably play an effector role in cell - mediated reactions to bacteria entering via peyer ' s patches , and certainly in response to agents such as mycobacterium paratuberculosis and histoplasma capsulatum found in the lamina propria ."
"bile pigment , perhaps derived from meconium , is seen sometimes in macrophages in the tips of villi in neonates .","the involvement of macrophages in the phagocytosis of cells ( enterocytes , theliolymphocytes , fibroblast sheath ) in the subepithelial lamina propria at the tips of villi or between the openings of colonic glands has been alluded to previously ."
"dimeric iga may bind to glycoprotein "" secretory component "" present on the basolateral border of columnar crypt epithelial cells , though this is not certain .","with secretory component , it is transported in vesicles through the cytoplasm to be released from the apical border of the cell into the lumen of the crypt ."
"however , igm - secreting plasma cells are prevalent in young calves , swine , and dogs .",iga - secreting cells are the predominant class of plasma cell in the lamina propria in most species .
"secretion into the bile , by hepatocytes , of iga complexed with antigen may , in the species in which it occurs , be a significant means of clearing the circulation of antigen absorbed from the gut .",it thereby reduces the likelihood of reaginic and other forms of immune response in the propria .
plasma cells containing igg are relatively uncommon in the intestinal lamina propria in species other than ruminants .,"however , locally produced and systemically circulating igg may assume significance when vascular permeability and inflammation occur , due to its ability to fix complement , facilitate antibody - dependent cell - mediated cytotoxicity , and opsonize ."
"its significance may be in ige - dependent cytotoxicity by eosinophils and perhaps by mast cells , as well as in mediating reaginic reactions in the mucosa .","plasmacytes producing ige are present in the lamina propria , and this class of immunoglobulin has been implicated particularly in immune responses to some intestinal parasites ."
they are not readily demonstrable after formalin fixation ; carnoy ' s fixative is best .,intestinal mast cells differ histochemically and physiologically from mast cells in most other tissues .
lymphocytes may comprise in excess of to % of cells present in the epithelial layer of the small intestine .,"the t cells are present in peyer ' s patches and are distributed throughout the mucosa , in the lamina propria , and are the great majority of the intraepithelial lymphocyte population ."
"it is no coincidence that bacterial diarrhea occurs most commonly in the neonate with a poorly established flora , or after changes in husbandry or antibiotic therapy that may disturb the enteric bacterial population .","it is relatively resistant to the intrusion of new inhabitants , and this is one of the major factors protecting against the establishment of pathogenic bacteria ."
"facultative anaerobes are important in maintaining the redox environment for strict anaerobes , by scavenging oxygen .",the high population of lactobacilli in the gut of milk - fed animals probably reduces establishment of enterobacteriaceae by this means .
"in germ - free gut , the proliferative compartment in the crypts is smaller and less active , and epithelial transit times to the tips of villi are slower than in conventional animals .","mucosal epithelial kinetics are also speeded up in conventional animals , in comparison with those that are germ free ."
"an abnormal microflora , colonic in character , may develop in the small intestine .",this bacterial overgrowth is due to achlorhydria and physical or physiologic derangements resulting in gut stasis or loss of normal peristaltic flushing .
"enteroinvasive bacteria often stimulate acute inflammation and cause extensive mucosal damage , including erosion and effusion of tissue fluid .","salmonella , however , is generally considered to be enteroinvasive , traversing the epithelium at a number of sites , perhaps including solitary or aggregated lymphoid follicles ."
"in intestinal adenomatosis complex , severe mucosal damage , by unknown mechanisms , may culminate in hemorrhage .",the effect in both these diseases is to cause loss of absorptive function and to permit effusion of tissue fluid .
"localization of corynebacterium equi largely in local lymphoid tissue in the gut , with ulceration , may progress to suppurative lymphadenitis .","rarely in domestic animals , yersinia may follow a similar route , which may culminate in caseous lymphadenitis and / or bacteremia ."
"for details of the pathogenesis and pathology of disease caused by these agents , see infectious and parasitic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract .","bacteria causing tyzzer ' s disease in foals , septicemic salmonellosis in some species , and probably some cases of e . coli septicemia in calves and lambs arise in the gut ."
"membranous cytoplasmic bodies have been reported in duodenal epithelial cells and in various cell types in the lamina propria in cats with generalized congenital gangliosidosis ( see the nervous system , volume ) .","congenital enzyme deficiencies of the intestinal absorptive epithelium , such as the specific disaccharidase deficiencies of humans , have not been reported in domestic animals ."
"although several theories have been proposed on the cause of segmental developmental anomalies , the most plausible is that there is impairment of blood supply to a segment of gut during early fetal life , resulting in ischemic necrosis of the affected area .","in the later stages of fetal development , the intestines withdraw , in an anterior to posterior direction , from the umbilicus into the abdomen ."
"atresia is further subdivided into membrane atresia , when the obstruction is formed by a simple membrane or diaphragm ; cord atresia , in which the blind ends of the gut are joined by a cord of connective tissue ; and blind - end atresia , in which a segment of gut and the corresponding mesentery are missing , leaving two blind ends .",the segmental anomalies of the intestine may be divided into two types : stenosis implies incomplete occlusion of the lumen ; complete occlusion is referred to as atresia .
"atresia coli is also commonly encountered , particularly in holstein calves and in foals , in which it may be hereditary .",atresia jejuni in jersey cattle and atresia ilei in swedish highland cattle are inherited as autosomal recessive traits .
"in horses it is present as a short , cone - shaped sac cm in diameter , which may be attached by mesodiverticular bands to the mesentery .","it is usually an incidental finding , although in horses it has been associated with strangulation of the intestine herniating through the mesodiverticular bands ."
the bladder and mesenteric and peripheral lymph nodes may also be affected grossly .,"although the lesion is usually an incidental finding , it has more commonly been associated with chronic enteric and pancreatic disease ."
the affected area is thickened and has the turgid feel of a rubber hose .,"the segment involved always includes the most caudal portion , but it may extend a variable distance forward , usually between and cm ."
"diveiticulosis of the small intestine is sometimes , but not necessarily , associated with muscular hypertrophy in pigs and horses .","it is characterized by the presence of cystic structures , which are lined by intestinal mucosa , in the muscularis and subserosa of the small intestine ."
"these are located mainly in the small intestine , although the large intestine , mesentery , and mesenteric lymph nodes may be involved .","microscopically , the cystic structures appear to be dilated lymphatics located in the lamina propria , submucosa , muscularis , subserosa , mesentery , and mesenteric lymph nodes ."
"affected pigs strain continuously , and rectal prolapse is a common complication .","rectal prolapse in sheep may be the consequence of ingestion of estrogenic pastures and is accompanied by other signs of hyperestrogenism ( see the female genital system , volume ) ."
these lesions are ischemic in origin due to interference with venous blood flow from the prolapsed section .,"only the mucosa , or all layers , may be involved in the prolapse ."
"circulatory embarrassment of a segment of bowel , through embolism or venous infarction , will also cause functional obstruction without a physical blockage .",ileus is a common sequel to peritoneal irritation and occurs proximal to any form of mechanical obstruction .
"but there is usually less acute electrolyte and acid - base imbalance , since vomition is less severe and absorption of fluid proximal to the obstruction may prevent serious distention and its associated secretion for some time .",secretion into obstructed gut is mainly stimulated by distention but may partially be related to bacterial overgrowth of the stagnant intestinal content .
lower intestinal or colonic obstruction may result in eventual metabolic acidosis and starvation following a chronic course .,"if ischemia and its complications do not ensue , the animal with acute obstruction succumbs to the systemic effects of hypovolemia and electrolyte and acid - base disturbance ."
"the location , degree , and duration of the obstruction determines the segment and length of bowel involved and the degree of distention .","in obstruction , the outstanding gross alteration in the bowel is distention proximal to the point of blockage due to paralytic ileus and the accumulation of fluid contents and gas ."
"blunt foreign bodies that become impacted cause acute or chronic obstruction depending on their size and often too are the cause of local pressure necrosis , perforation occurring in some cases .","strips of cloth or string , which are not infrequently ingested by dogs and cats , may pass through the intestine ."
"inflammatory peritoneal adhesions are common , and fibrous bands may stretch from the wall of the bowel to some fixed point or between two or more points along the bowel or mesentery ; the obstruction develops gradually as cicatrization ties the bowel down or puts kinks in the mesentery .","therefore , most of them involve the anterior - dorsal part of the abdominal cavity and impinge on the duodenum ."
"it also occurs in peritoneal irritation of any cause , especially in peritonitis .","it frequently follows abdominal surgery in transient episodes , especially when the intestines are handled roughly or traumatized ."
"the defect may be segmental , involving less than a meter of the intestinal length , but there may be many such segments involved , especially in diffuse peritonitis .",gastric rupture may occur in the horse as a complication of obstructive or postoperative ileus of the small intestine .
"grass sickness in horses , for which there is as yet no good pathologic definition , occurs chiefly in parts of the united kingdom and western europe , with few exceptions in animals at pasture .","although horses of any age may be afflicted , the disease is more common in those years of age ."
"the stomach is distended with fluid ( up to liters have been measured ) , often of khaki color and pea - soup consistency , although sometimes more watery with fibrous material .","the esophageal wall is sometimes edematous , and the mucosa may show longitudinal bands of congestion and ulceration ."
intraperitoneal injection of the neurotoxic factor into ponies produces characteristic lesions but not clinical disease .,"these observations suggest that the neurotoxic factor may be the result , rather than the cause , of grass sickness , or that relatively high plasma concentrations are required to cause clinical signs ."
"these are commonly congenital as in schistosomus reflexus , patent umbilicus , and congenital diaphragmatic hernia .","eventration is displacement of a portion of the intestine , usually the small intestine , outside the abdominal cavity ."
"when the increase in the concentration of dissociated volatile fatty acids , especially butyric acid , is severe , the cecum becomes atonic and dilation follows .","once the cecum is dilated and distended with watery ingesta , various degrees of clockwise or counterclockwise torsion can occur , which may incorporate adjacent viscera , particularly a loop of distal jejunum ."
the left dorsal and ventral colon move dorsally and are trapped between the suspensory ligament of the spleen and the dorsal abdominal wall .,pelvic flexure may double back on itself and become wedged between stomach and liver as well .
herniation through a natural foramen occurs in horses in two locations .,a portion of small intestine may pass down into the omental bursa and become incarcerated if the normally short and slitlike epiploic foramen of winslow is dilated for any reason .
mesenteric hernia is due to passage of intestine through a tear in the mesentery .,"these are probably traumatic defects and usually involve the mesentery of the small intestine and , in horses , that of the colon ."
"during the operation , excessive traction on the spermatic cord may tear the peritoneal fold of the ductus deferens , which fixes the duct to the pelvic wall .","a hiatus is formed between the ductus deferens and the lateral abdominal or pelvic walls , and through it , loops of intestine may become incarcerated ."
"the hernial ring is an opening in the abdominal wall , and this may be acquired , or it may be natural as , for example , the inguinal ring .","the hernia usually contains a portion of omentum , the more freely mobile portions of the intestine , and occasionally , one or more of the other viscera ."
"these hernias may be apparently spontaneous in pregnant females or be a consequence of blunt trauma , horn injuries , surgical scars , or inflammations that cause weakening or perforation of the supporting musculature .",they may attain very large size in herbivores because of the weight of the alimentary viscera and pregnant uterus .
"it is most frequent in pigs , foals , calves , and pups and depends on persistent patency of the umbilical ring .",umbilical hernia is common and is often present as a congenital and inherited defect .
"routine castration of such animals may lead to eventration through the scrotal incision , and closed castration may cause infarction of the herniated loop of gut .","the bitch differs from females of other species in having a patent inguinal ring and canal through which the round ligament , the omentum , and the uterus may pass ."
"omentum and small intestine pass through the smaller clefts ; liver , stomach , and other viscera may pass through the larger defects .","in dogs and cats , acquired rupture of the diaphragm is a result of acute abdominal compression , usually from automobile accidents ."
as long as the hernial contents remain freely movable and the hernia is reducible there may be no untoward sequelae .,"the sequelae of hernias depend largely on their location and content , but there are some generalities that are applicable to all ."
"obstruction of the efferent veins , blockage of afferent arteries , and reduced flow through an open circulation cause hypoxic damage to the intestine .","whatever the initiating agency , the effect of hypoxia at the level of the mucosa is the same ."
epithelial cells appear relatively normal but may separate from the villus in sheets .,"within to hr , the villus is completely denuded of epithelium and the mesenchymal core is disintegrating or collapsed and stumpy , with hemorrhage from capillaries ."
"dissociation and necrosis of cells in the crypts of lieberkuhn begins ~ 2 hr after the initiation of ischemia , and within to hr the mucosal epithelium appears completely necrotic or has sloughed , leaving a mesenchymal ghost of the mucosa .","the muscularis mucosae may undergo necrosis , but the muscularis externa remains viable for to hr ."
"mild morphologic damage is found after hr , but severe mucosal lesions are evident by hr .","the colon , of the dog at least , seems less sensitive to ischemia than the small intestine ."
"short - term ischemia with preservation of at least the base of the crypts of lieberkuhn will permit resolution , as proliferation of cells in the crypts reepithelializes the mucosal surface within to days .","if hypoxia is only partial , or ischemia is transient , with reflow occurring , the outcome may be variable ."
"focal ulcerative lesions may ultimately heal by epithelial migration , over the bed of granulation tissue , from surviving crypts within the lesion and around the periphery .",neutrophilic infiltration and effusion may be considerable if bacterial contamination of the lumen is heavy .
"chronic ischemic ulcers in the small bowel tend to develop a depressed , fairly clean , granulating surface , occasionally with some fibrinous exudate .","extensive mucosal ulcers that form following ischemia with vascular reflow have little chance of resolution , due to their large surface area ."
"absorption of endotoxin or endotoxin - like molecules from the lumen may occur through devitalized mucosa via the portal flow , lymphatic return , or peritoneum .","these compounds have a severe detrimental effect on cardiovascular function , contributing to the circulatory failure ."
"local invasion of the mucosa by mycotic agents may result in focal or segmental lesions , however , due to hyphal invasion of submucosal veins .",primary thrombosis of the mesenteric veins is a rare cause of infarction in domestic animals .
"even if a displacement , volvulus , or strangulation has been reduced , the limits of the infarcted segment are generally sharply demarcated .","advanced venous infarction involves the full thickness of the intestinal wall , and the initiating intestinal accident is commonly evident , except in cases subjected to surgery ."
"at autopsy , the usual signs of strangulation obstruction are evident , including dilatation and devitalization of the infarcted segment , distention of the cecum , and perhaps , postmortem rupture of the diaphragm or abdominal wall due to tympany .","it usually occurs as the left dorsal colon moves mesially on the left ventral colon , progressing to volvulus at the sternal and diaphragmatic flexures ."
"tension and compression of mesenteric veins cause the intussusceptum , or a portion of it , to undergo venous infarction .",this tension along one edge of the gut causes the mass to become bowed or spiraled .
"in horses it is associated with endarteritis , mainly at the root of the cranial mesenteric circulation , in animals less than ~ 3 years of age , caused by migrating larvae of strongylus vulgaris ( see the cardiovascular system , volume ) .",mucosal and occasionally transmural focal or segmental infarctive lesions are seen in pasteurella septicemia in lambs and in haemophilus somnus bacteremia in cattle .
"the fluid content in the affected gut is foul - smelling , but not particularly blood tinged .","more commonly , irregularly demarcated areas of infarcted intestine have a thickened , edematous , congested wall , which appears deep red - black or green - black on both mucosal and serosal aspects ."
fibrinolysis may have removed the obstructing thrombi ; thrombi may be multiple and microscopic ( sometimes they are found in arteries in tissue sections of infarcted tissue ) ; or the lesions may be the result of diminished tissue perfusion due to obstructed flow caused by verminous endarteritis ( but not thromboembolism ) or by vascular spasm .,"in the latter case they may be the result of "" slow flow , "" discussed further below ."
"the pathogenesis of the lesion is related to reflex vasoconstriction in the mucosa and submucosa , shunting of blood away from the mucosa , dilation of mucosal capillaries , and reduction in rate of flow of blood through the villus .",countercurrent transfer of oxygen from the afferent to efferent vessels in the villus aggravates hypoxemia in the villus by increased shunting of oxygen to the efferent venule .
"microscopic lesions in the small and large intestine are consistent with an ischemic pathogenesis , and microthrombi have been associated with mucosal infarcts in the large bowel as well as in other organs .","acute acorn poisoning in the horse may cause severe gastrointestinal edema and focal hemorrhage , with infarction and ulceration in the cecum and colon ."
the precarious perfusion of the mucosa at this site may contribute to ischemic ulceration and the development of rectal stricture in swine .,"this condition in many cases appears to be associated with salmonella infection , and it is discussed further under salmonellosis , in swine ."
transient or noninfarctive slow flow has been proposed as a cause of intermittent colic due to verminous arteritis .,it may also play a role in the development of functional obstruction and volvulus in horses with cranial mesenteric arterial lesions .
"the intestinal mucosa is lined by an extremely labile population of cells , ultimately derived from stem cells at the base of crypts or glands but with its proximate source in amplifier populations of undifferentiated columnar or oligomucous cells in the lower half of the crypts .","these cells differentiate into goblet cells and the functional population of enterocytes as they move from the crypt to the villus , losing their ability to undergo mitosis ."
the stability of this equilibrium suggests that local feedback exists between the functional compartment on villi and the proliferative compartment in the crypts .,"this steady state is the product of a dynamic equilibrium between the rate of movement of cells out of crypts and onto villi , and the rate at which they are lost from the tips of villi ."
adaptive responses to a variety of factors alter the size and rate of turnover of the proliferative and functional epithelial - cell populations and with them the microtopography of the gut .,"the number of crypts also stabilizes , but some adaptive variation in the ratio of crypts to villi may occur ."
"hence , it is highly desirable to correlate the histologic appearance with the microtopography of the mucosa as seen under the dissecting or scanning electron microscope .","there is obviously also some correlation between the length and profile of villi and the functional surface area , though the three - dimensional structure of an abnormal mucosa is often poorly reflected in section ."
"resection of a segment of gut causes hypertrophy of the mucosa remaining distal to the surgical site , which is reflected in dilation of the bowel and thickening of the mucosa due to longer crypts and villi .","postresectional hypertrophy also occurs in the mucosa of separated loops of gut and in cross - circulated animals , suggesting a hormonal influence ."
"there is speculation that paracrine effects of other peptides released from enteroendocrine cells in the gut , in response to a variety of luminal stimuli , may also influence epithelial proliferation .","such also appears to be the case in celiac sprue in humans , where crypt - cell proliferation is high and enteroglucagon levels are concurrently elevated ."
the second category is comprised of gut with variable villus atrophy and some evidence of damage to the proliferative compartment .,"the first category includes intestine with atrophy of villi to varying degrees , associated with apparently normal or hypertrophic crypts ."
"the lamina propria appears moderately hypercellular , perhaps due to condensation , possibly due to a mild mononuclear - cell infiltrate .","crypts enlarge in diameter and length to accommodate more mitotic epithelial cells , which are basophilic , crowded , and obviously dividing , sometimes very close to the surface of the mucosa ."
2 d ) and histoplasmosis ; and idiopathic granulomatous enteritis or chronic enteritis characterized by heavy lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltrates in the mucosa .,the epithelial kinetics have not been investigated in most of these situations in domestic animals .
"eerimental evidence is accumulating that cell - mediated immune events in the mucosa initiate villus atrophy and cryptal hypertrophy in graft - versus - host reaction , intestinal trichinellosis , and giardiasis in mice .","these observations are being extrapolated in humans to intestinal allergy to some dietary anti - gens , and to celiac disease ; similar phenomena are likely to be active in domestic animals ."
"surface epithelium is subsequently rapidly lost into the lumen , matching the rate of cell production .","in eerimental intestinal trichinellosis , fewer surface receptors for lectins are present on enterocytes , suggesting an altered cell membrane ."
"the proliferative compartment is eanded and active , and mitotic figures are numerous .","in its milder forms , the lesion may be better characterized by elongate crypts than by obvious atrophy of villi ."
increased turnover of epithelium may contribute to enteric loss of endogenous protein .,"however induced , atrophy of villi with hypertrophy of crypts is associated with local malabsorption of nutrients and water ; elongate crypts and , perhaps , poorly differentiated surface epithelium may secrete electrolyte and water ; and if there is proprial inflammation and microerosion of the mucosa , effusion of tissue fluid may ensue ."
"following radiation , cytotoxic damage , and parvovirus infection , bizarre irregular epithelial cells with large nuclei and nucleoli may be present in crypts and will migrate onto the surface .",preexisting surface epithelium continues to move off the tips of villi at an apparently normal rate even though few or no new cells emerge from crypts .
"local ulceration may lead to persistent plasma loss , and if circumferential , to stricture and stenosis .",small ulcers in areas where a few crypts have dropped out will .
diffuse or focal infiltration of the lamina propria by neoplastic lymphocytes appears to separate and crowd out crypts .,"it also distorts the shape of villi , which become stubby and covered by low columnar or cuboidal epithelium ."
cells lose the ability to divide after leaving the proliferative compartment in the lower part of the gland .,"epithelial turnover in the cecum and colon is fundamentally similar to that in the small intestine , though villi are not present on the surface ."
"crowded mitotic cells are present over a greater proportion of the length of the gland , sometimes virtually to the surface of the mucosa .","the proliferative compartment in the gland may hypertrophy , causing glands to elongate and dilate ."
"cytotoxins and parvoviruses tend not to produce severe lesions so commonly in large bowel as they do in small intestine , however , perhaps because a lower proportion of the proliferative compartment is in mitosis at the time of maximum availability of drug or virus .","additions to the list of agents damaging the proliferative compartment in the large intestine include coronavirus in calves and several species of coccidia in ruminants , which develop in the cells lining glands in the large bowel ."
"severe lesions will lead to loss of glands and erosion and ulceration of the mucosa , perhaps with hemorrhage .","dilatation of crypts containing necrotic debris , and lined by attenuated epithelium , indicates such damage ."
"common consequences of enteric disease include inability to eat or loss of appetite ; reduced growth rate , weight loss , or cachexia ; hypoproteinemia ; and anemia , perhaps with obvious hemorrhage into the gut .",the detrimental effects of gastrointestional diseases are mediated by a number of often interacting mechanisms .
"the final step is delivery of the nutrient by the enterocyte to the interstitial fluid , and its uptake into the blood or lymph .","digestion and assimilation of nutrients have an intraluminal phase , mediated by the biliary and pancreatic secretions , and an epithelial phase , carried out by enzyme systems on the surface and in the cytoplasm of absorptive enterocytes ."
bile salt deficiency as a cause of intraluminal maldigestion is rarely seen in domestic animals .,the epithelial phase of digestion is impaired by loss of functional epithelial surface area .
increased absorption of oxalate may be a sequel to reduced concentrations of calcium in the lumen due to soap formation .,"malabsorbed lipid may cause colonic diarrhea , by mechanisms that will be discussed subsequently ."
calves and older ruminants normally lack significant amounts of pancreatic amylase and digest starch poorly in the small intestine .,"mucosal oligosaccharidase deficiency occurs in villus atrophy , with reduced mucosal surface area ."
"if villus atrophy is relatively localized , the reserve capacity of more distal small bowel may offset the effects of local nutrient malabsorption , and there may not be net malabsorption over the full length of the small intestine .","a reduction in absorption of minerals and vitamins may be intuitively eected in animals with reduced absorptive surface in villus atrophy , above and beyond specific mechanisms alluded to previously ."
diarrhea is the presence in feces of water in relative excess in proportion to fecal dry matter .,"diarrhea usually reflects increased absolute fecal loss of water , but may not if absolute fecal dry matter excretion is markedly reduced ."
"large volumes of fluid derived from ingesta and secretion from the stomach , bile , pancreas , and the gut itself enter the small bowel ; in addition , considerable passive movement of water occurs into the upper small bowel from the circulation in response to osmotic effects .",absorption by enterocytes of osmotically active nutrient molecules and electrolyte draws water from lumen into the interstitial space .
"it has a finite capacity for absorption of electrolyte and fluid , and if this is exceeded by the rate at which content enters from the small bowel , diarrhea occurs .","the colon , in addition to its fermentative function , has the ultimate responsibility for conserving electrolyte and water by absorption from the digesta , thereby minimizing fecal losses ."
"here , since the "" villous "" limb of the postulated crypt - villus fluid circuit is diminished or missing , fluid secreted by the crypts may not be absorbed .","a secretory component probably contributes to diarrhea due to villus atrophy , at least in transmissible gastroenteritis in pigs ."
"effusion may occur similarly in lymphatic obstruction or lymphangiectasia , and in inflamed lamina propria , with increased vascular permeability , proprial edema , and enteric plasma protein loss .","portal hypertension or right - sided heart failure , hypoalbuminemia , and eansion of plasma volume establish such conditions ."
large bowel diarrhea is the product of a reduced innate capability of the colon to handle the solute and fluid presented by the more proximal bowel .,a change in net absorption by the colon that is relatively small in absolute terms may be sufficient to cause fluid feces .
"as a result , it resists alterations in permeability due to increased hydrostatic pressure in the propria , when compared with the small intestine .","the colonic mucosa is not as innately "" l e a k y "" as the small intestinal mucosa due to the nature of the tight junctions between epithelial cells ."
absorption of volatile fatty acids produced by bacterial fermentation is responsible for considerable concurrent absorption of water in the large intestine .,"although colonic secretion stimulated by bacterial enterotoxin is not clearly implicated in diarrhea , alterations in the flora in the large bowel may be detrimental to normal function ."
"they are readily handled by the colon under normal circumstances , by rapid absorption , and by bicarbonate buffering .",bacterial fermentation of carbohydrate results in the production of an increased number of molecules of volatile fatty acid .
"hypermotility , if it does occur , may be in response to , rather than a cause of , increased volumes of fluid in the gut .","increased colonic motor activity is often segmental and antiperistaltic , and probably unrelated to increased transit ."
binding of vitamin b by enteric flora prevents absorption in the ileum and may lead to deficiency .,"dihydroxy bile acids and malabsorbed fatty acids promote secretion by the small bowel and colon , resulting in diarrhea ."
"severe derangement in any species may lead to cachexia , hypoproteinemia , and death .","disorders of protein metabolism attributable to enteric disease are responsible for significant economic loss in the form of reduced weight gain , wool growth , and milk production ."
"a sharp decline in appetite , or anorexia , is a common sign of indigestion , obstruction , or systemic disease .","in ruminants , loss of appetite to varying degrees is an important component of the pathogenicity of gastrointestinal parasites , including those infecting the abomasum ( ostertagia ) , small intestine ( trichostrongylus ) , and large bowel ( oesophagostomum ) ."
"unless the lesion is widespread , or low in the small bowel , however , net absorption of nitrogen over the length of the small intestine may not be reduced , due to the compensatory capacity of more distal normal mucosa .",malabsorption of peptides and amino acids may occur locally in the small intestine as a result of significant villus atrophy .
"excess endogenous protein entering the intestine is derived from two main sources , namely , increased turnover of cells lining the gut and effusion of plasma protein into the lumen of the bowel .","protein - losing gastroenteropathy , increased catabolism , and loss of endogenous nitrogen via the gastrointestinal tract are important in many diseases ."
"microscopic "" leaks "" in the mucosa also permit plasma loss into the gut .","such lesions may be due to infarction , severe cryptal necrosis , or acute inflammatory damage to the mucosa associated with bacteria , viruses , and coccidia , causing fibrinohemorrhagic enteritis ."
"the hypoalbuminemia in enteric plasma loss is often associated with hyperglobulinemia , since compensatory synthesis of immunoglobulin is remarkable .",several times more immunoglobulin than albumin may be lost into the gut as a result .
"if the fractional catabolic rate is gradually and only slightly increased , so that compensation occurs with the albumin pool in equilibrium in only a marginally reduced state ( perhaps near or within the "" n o r m a l "" range ) , subclinical protein loss occurs .","though the fractional catabolic rate is only slightly elevated , the relatively large size of the albumin pool may mean that the absolute loss of protein exceeds that in a hypoalbuminemic animal with a higher fractional catabolic rate but a smaller albumin pool ."
ammonia nitrogen absorbed from the colon is converted in the liver mainly to urea .,animals with increased endogenous protein loss into the stomach or small intestine tend to have slightly raised levels of blood urea nitrogen and an elevated rate of urinary urea excretion .
catabolism of peripheral protein then assumes an increasingly important role in maintaining the pool of amino acids available for plasma and intestinal protein synthesis .,"if protein intake is poor due to inappetence or a low - quality ration , or if the rate of protein loss is high , the animal moves into negative nitrogen balance ."
anemia and hypoproteinemia may be due to hemorrhage externally or into the gastrointestinal tract .,"advanced liver disease may cause hypoalbuminemia ; other signs of hepatic failure will likely be concurrent ( see the liver and biliary system , this volume ) ."
erythroid hyperplasia in the marrow or in extramedullary sites may not compensate for the continued bleeding .,"blood loss of any origin , including that due to hematophagous parasites , may cause anemia ."
"intestinal nematode parasitism due to trichostrongylus in ruminants , and strongyhides in all species , causes malabsorption and plasma loss .","malabsorption of nutrients , electrolyte , and water is at the root of disease in animals caused by rotavirus , coronavirus , cryptosporidium , and rarely , e . coli ; significant loss of protein probably does not occur in these conditions ."
"in dogs and horses , and to a lesser extent in other species , there may be idiopathic , sporadic or breed - related disease variably signaled clinically by chronic diarrhea , weight loss , hypoproteinemia , and often malabsorption , as defined by tests of carbohydrate and lipid assimilation .","intestinal biopsy is usually necessary to make a diagnosis , permitting the establishment of a prognosis and course of therapy ."
"the surface epithelium may appear normal or perhaps slightly attenuated , and lateral interepithelial spaces are often dilated .","the lacteals in many villi are distended , and lymphatics in deeper portions of the mucosa may be also ."
"many cases appear to be acquired , and some may be due to lymphosarcomatous or granulomatous infiltrates obstructing flow in mesenteric lymph nodes .","usually , no congenital or acquired obstruction of the lymphatic drainage is obvious ."
"it has been proposed that dilated lacteals may rupture , releasing lymph into the lumen of the intestine .","hypocalcemia may be related to loss of the mineral bound to plasma albumin , and perhaps to formation of soaps with malabsorbed lipid in the gut lumen ."
"in the second situation , dilated lacteals may be secondary to edema resulting from reduced plasma oncotic pressure , rather than the cause of such a problem .","in johne ' s disease , the lesion may be the result of local edema due to inflammation in the propria and mesenteric lymphatics combined with hypoproteinemia ."
"diarrhea and weight loss suggest malabsorption and protein - losing enteropathy , and circulating eosinophilia is often present .","signs may vary from vomition associated with gastritis , to chronic small bowel diarrhea , or chronic large bowel diarrhea with hematochezia resulting from ulcerative eosinophilic colitis ."
"the affected segment of the alimentary tract is thickened , or the mucosa may be irregularly folded or nodular and perhaps hemorrhagic , eroded , or ulcerated .","gross lesions are associated with heavy infiltrates of normal eosinophils in the rnucosa , submucosa , and often transmurally , involving muscularis and serosa ."
"in one series of german shepherds , eosinophilic granulomas were present in gastrointestinal tissues and other organs , and larvae of tocara canis were implicated .","granulomas are not reported in other cases , which probably represent a separate condition ."
"clinically , intestinal thickening , hepato - and splenomegaly , and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes may be present , in association with circulating eosinophilia and hyperplasia of the eosinophil series in the marrow .","diarrhea , sometimes bloody , vomition , loss of appetite , and loss of condition may be represented in the history ."
"in the small intestine the eosinophilic infiltrate may be transmural and is accompanied by hypertrophy of the muscle layers , causing a thickened appearance grossly .","lymph nodes may have hyperplastic follicles and many mature eosinophils in sinusoids , or they may vary through eosinophilic lymphadenitis with fibrosis to complete obliteration of normal architecture and replacement by eosinophils in a fibrillar stroma extending through the capsule into surrounding tissue ."
"microscopically , there is diffuse infiltration of the mucosa , submucosa , and often , deeper layers of the enteric wall by eosinophils , mast cells , macrophages , lymphocytes , and some plasma cells .","moderate to severe villus atrophy , fibroplasia in the lamina propria , and hypertrophy of the muscularis mucosae occur ."
chronic inflammation in the mucosa may elain protein loss and hypoalbuminemia .,"the cause of this syndrome is unknown , though the involvement of a reaction to ingested allergens is suggested ."
"normally , plasma cells are uncommon in the lamina propria of villi .","the cardinal finding is abnormally intense infiltrates of welldifferentiated lymphocytes and plasma cells in the lamina propria of villi , between crypts , and sometimes in the submucosa ."
"animals with the gray collie syndrome ( cyclic hematopoiesis ) also may have lymphocytic - plasmacytic enteritis ( see the hematopoietic system , volume ) .","hypergammaglobulinemia occurs commonly in the late stages of the syndrome in basenjis , and lymphosarcoma develops in some affected animals ."
"though it may represent an abnormal response to antigen entering from the lumen , no dietary or other antigen has been conclusively implicated .",the cause of lymphocytic - plasmacytic enteritis is not known in any species .
"mesenteric lymph nodes are usually enlarged , edematous , with mottled firm gray areas , fibrotic nodules , or rarely , caseous or mineralized foci on the cut surface .","granulomatous pale , caseous , or calcified foci may be scattered in the liver ."
"giant cells may be present in sinusoids , or granulomatous foci of varying sizes may be evident .","the affected lymph nodes are hyperplastic , usually with prominent sinus histiocytosis ."
"typhlitis and colitis may be manifestations of a generalized or systemic disease ; they may be part of an enterocolitis involving both small and large intestine ; or they may be regional and limited to a segment of the intestine , often terminal ileum , cecum , and colon or some shorter part of the large bowel .","they may be limited in distribution to the mucosa or be transmural , involving submucosa , muscularis , serosa , and frequently , the draining lymph nodes ."
colitis in each of the species will be considered in turn .,"in any species , damage to the colonic mucosa may result in malabsorption of electrolytes and water , and perhaps net secretion ."
"microscopically , a single large , flask - shaped gland , lined by columnar epithelium and containing mucus and exfoliated cells or necrotic debris , may be present .",the dilated glands may be grossly visible through the serosa and muscularis as nodular masses a few millimeters in diameter .
ulcerative colitis in dogs is also caused rarely by entamoeba histolytica .,"rarely , trichuriasis may be complicated by infection with balantidium coli , which possibly contributes to the development of mucosal erosion or ulceration ."
"campylobacter jejuni is isolated from dogs with diarrhea , but its possible relationship to colitis in clinical cases is currently unclear .",the association of giardiasis and colitis in dogs is considered to be fortuitous .
"severely affected dogs may be cachectic , probably due in part to enteric loss of plasma protein .",idiopathic ulcerative colitis does not seem as severe as histiocytic ulcerative colitis of boxers and rarely comes to autopsy .
"in many cases of mild chronic mucosal colitis , the glands do not appear particularly hyperplastic ; the mucosa may appear thin or atrophic .","generally , milder lesions of superficial epithelium are associated with mild or moderate mucosal inflammation , which may be acute or chronic ."
eosinophilic colitis forms part of the syndrome of eosinophilic gastroenteritis discussed previously .,"it conforms to the general description of the spectrum of lesions in idiopathic colitis , with the exception that eosinophils form a predominant part of the cellular infiltrate in the mucosa and superficial submucosa ."
"ulcers usually do not progress beyond the submucosa , and they are lined by granulation tissue .",ulceration seems to progress from the superficial epithelial erosion and destruction of the basement membrane seen in early lesions .
"certainly , bodies resembling microorganisms have been found in macrophages , and the involvement of chlamydiae , rickettsias , and mycoplasmas has been postulated .","the material being digested may be phagocytosed cell debris and microorganisms picked up in the superficial lamina propria and carried in "" constipated "" macrophages to deeper structures ."
the relative paucity and mildness of lesions in the colon is related to the lower rate of epithelial proliferation in comparison with the small intestine .,the pathology of panleukopenia is considered under infectious and parasitic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract .
"fibrinoid arteritis causing hemorrhage and edema in the colonic submucosa , and perhaps ischemic necrosis of the mucosa , is also reported .","the granulomatous syndrome is attributed to feline infectious peritonitis , and there may be characteristic lesions in other organs ."
"the diagnosis of acute colitis in horses resolves into the differentiation of peracute and acute salmonellosis from a similar condition , colitis x .",both of these must be differentiated from the sequelae of intestinal accidents and thromboembolism involving the large bowel .
the pathogenesis of colitis x is uncertain and may be multifactorial .,"it seems likely that it , probably salmonellosis , and some even less well defined chronic diarrheas in horses are the result of dysbacteriosis of the large bowel ."
"the proliferation of c . perfringens precedes the clinical episode , and the organism may not be numerous in the large bowel at death .",eerimental infusion of extracts of c . perfringens type a etoxin in ponies has marked systemic effects and causes severe edema and hemorrhage of the colonic mucosa and submucosa as well as sloughing of epithelium on the tips of villi in the small intestine .
"endotoxin may also play a role , either by absorption through a mucosa already damaged by previous insult or by release of abnormal amounts following a change in the flora in the large intestine .",systemic effects of endotoxin may contribute to shock and to the microthrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation that sometimes occur .
"these may be the product of arterial thromboembolism and slow flow or , less likely , corrected strangulation with reflow .",phenylbutazone administration also has been associated with cecal and colonic ulceration and plasma protein loss .
the specific cause of extensive ulceration may be difficult to determine .,"smaller chronic ulcers and widespread subacute erosion and ulceration are most likely the result of salmonellosis , rather than ischemia , and the agent should be sought by culture of the affected area , preferably by trituration of tissue and use of selective media ."
"these horses will show transient response to therapeutic agents that affect anaerobic bacteria and protozoa , but they usually regress when medication is withdrawn .",the response to implants of cecal or colonic content is variable and usually discouraging .
mucosal thickening is reflected in the presence of the characteristic cerebriform folds of the serosal aspect of the bowel that is commonly seen .,"the latter condition is readily recognized by the consistent concurrent involvement of the terminal ileum by adenomatosis , with or without hemorrhage , or by necrotic ileitis ."
"campylobacter associated with intestinal adenomatosis is readily identified in smears of affected mucosa stained with carbolfuchsin , and the large spirochetes causing swine dysentery may also be identified in mucosal scrapings at necropsy .",culture of affected tissues confirms these diagnoses and that of salmonellosis .
coccidiosis may involve ileum and large intestine ; it often can be diagnosed by mucosal scraping at autopsy .,"adenovirus infection may cause severe hemorrhagic colitis , with few lesions elsewhere , as may malignant head catarrh on occasion ."
the mucosa of the large bowel in these cases is thickened and rugose .,"granulomatous typhlocolitis associated with chronic diarrhea and wasting may occur in johne ' s disease , concurrently with granulomatous ileitis and mesenteric lymphadenitis ."
lymphosarcoma is the most common malignant tumor of mesenchymal origin in most animals ; it is most prevalent in the cat .,"lymphosarcoma may arise in the gut , although involvement of this area is more often part of multicentric disease ( see the hematopoietic system , volume ) ."
there is little information on the biologic behavior of these tumors .,"these are characterized by the presence of anaplastic epithelial cells in situ in the mucosa and , rarely , in the stalk of propria ."
these tumors often coexist with papillomas and squamous - cell carcinomas of the upper alimentary tract ( see neoplasia of the esophagus and forestomachs ) .,a high prevalence of intestinal adenomas and to a lesser extent adenocarcinomas in cattle has been reported in upland areas in scotland and northern england .
the average age of dogs with intestinal carcinomas is years .,"the rest are equally divided between the stomach and small intestine , mainly duodenum ."
"the papillary type of intestinal adenocarcinomas do form intraluminal masses , which tend to involve larger segments of the intestine , suggesting horizontal spread .","these tumors often do not ulcerate , and they usually do not project into the lumen of the gut ."
the tumor cells have abundant amphophilic to basophilic cytoplasm and large vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli .,these have only a slight tendency to differentiate to acinar structures .
"with the exception of papillary adenocarcinomas , desmoplasia is is a prominent feature of these neoplasms , elaining their common tendency to cause stricture and obstruction of the intestine .","all types , except possibly the papillary type , metastasize widely , mainly via the lymphatics to the regional nodes ."
"next to lymphosarcoma , intestinal adenocarcinoma is the most common intestinal tumor in cats .",the prevalence of intestinal carcinomas is lower in cats than in dogs .
"when the tumor is located at the ileocecal junction , both the large and small intestine are usually involved .","the ileum is the most common site affected , followed by the jejunum ."
"these cells secrete vasoactive amines , which are responsible for the argentaffinic and argyrophilic tinctorial properties of the tumors .",functional derangements from excessive production of amines have not been reported in animals .
they have been reported mainly in aged dogs and occur rarely in the cat and cow .,"in dogs , carcinoids are mainly located in the duodenum , colon , and rectum ."
"carcinoid tumor cells have dense , round to oval , membrane - bound secretory granules in the cytoplasm that vary in diameter from to nm .","they have abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum , and the plasma membrane forms interdigitating processes ."
the latter are round and have an intensely eosinophilic granular cytoplasm with distinct cytoplasmic borders and central oval nuclei .,cells in intestinal mast - cell tumors are unlike mast cells in mastocytomas involving the skin and other organs .
"none of the tumor cells contains the crystalline , electron - dense granules present in normal mast cells and in mastocytomas in other sites .",a few tumor cells contains electron - dense fibrillar granules or intermediate forms .
ulceration of the gastrointestinal mucosa occurs commonly with visceral mast - cell tumors in cats and large cutaneous mastocytomas in dogs .,"metastases occur most often in the mesenteric lymph nodes , followed by the liver , spleen , and rarely , the lungs ."
in addition to these areas are others that are periodically visited by the virus and in whose susceptible populations the disease spreads rapidly .,"some other areas , notably japan , australia , new zealand , and north america , are currently free because of geographic isolation and quarantine restrictions ."
the virus is highly resistant under many circumstances but is inactivated by direct sunlight and moderate acidity .,"the virus of foot and mouth disease belongs to the picornaviridae , in the genus aphthovirus ( aphtha - vesicles in the mouth ) ."
virus recovered from carriers will infect susceptible animals by means of inoculation .,"persistence of infection in convalescence has been extensively examined only in cattle , and the carrier state persists for up to months ."
"these can be distinguished by serologic tests , although there are various degrees of overlap .","there are seven principal antigenic types , namely , the classical a , o , and c types , sat - 1 , sat - 2 , sat - 3 , and asia - 1 ."
"they regularly develop pancreatic necrosis , with some necrosis of skeletal and cardiac muscle .",young adult guinea pigs can be infected by infection into the footpad .
here they have been related to persistent aftereffects of natural and eerimental infections .,"high titers of virus develop in all areas of skin , not necessarily related to lesions , and in several visceral tissues , including pancreas and hypophysis ."
the duration of persistence of antibody is correlated with the initial titer .,"in general , animals are resistant to reinfection with homologous strains by natural eure for about to years ; susceptibility increases as the antibody titer declines ."
"in the living animal , there is diffuse buccal hyperemia and mild catarrhal stomatitis , but the hyperemia disappears at death .","vesicles form on the inner aspects of the lips and cheeks , the gums , hard palate , dental pad , and especially on the sides and anterior portion of the dorsum of the tongue ."
the swellings persist until the vesicles rupture and the resultant erosions heal ; healing may be considerably delayed on the feet .,vesicles may also occur in the other sites but much less frequently .
immunofluorescence occurs in mononuclear cells of the lamina propria before there is evidence of virus in the epithelial cells .,the papilla serves as a bridge for transport of the virus from the vascular lamina propria to the avascular squamous epithelium .
"it is characteristic enough to be referred to as the typical "" tiger heart ' ' on account of the striping and mottling .",the myocardial lesion involves the ventricular musculature and the papillary muscle as poorly defined pale foci of varying size .
"additionally , syndromes of panting and hypertrichosis and disturbances of the regulation of body temperature , lactation , and fertility ( including abortion ) and of emaciation or obesity have been described .","residual bacterial infections are common complications , especially in the oral cavity and mammary glands , and on the feet ."
"vesicular stomatitis is a specific viral disease occurring naturally among horses , cattle , and pigs , and it is transmissible eerimentally to a number of laboratory animals , including guinea pigs and mice .","the disease is important because it causes a loss in production , especially in dairy herds , and it must be differentiated from foot and mouth disease in cattle and pigs ."
"the indiana strain has three serotypes and occurs in vertebrate hosts but also in arthropods such as phlebotomus flies , sand flies ( culicoides ) , and mosquitoes .","the more common and more virulent new jersey strain has only one serotype , is restricted to vertebrate hosts , and extends farthest north into more temperate zones ."
"the incubation period following eure by abrasion is - 48 hr , and there is a viremic phase that persists longer than the vesicular , but secondary lesions are rare .","in cattle , intramuscular injections will not initiate the disease , a useful distinguishing feature from foot and mouth disease ."
it was first diagnosed in southern california in the s and eventually spread to most swine - producing states in the united states .,"vesicular exanthema is an acute , febrile , viral disease of swine that is characterized by formation of vesicles on the mouth , skin , and feet ."
it has a single - stranded rna genome and has only one major polypeptide .,"it is about nm in diameter , and characteristic cup - shaped structures ( calyces ) are evident in electron microscopic preparations ."
"this virus , called san miguel sea lion virus , produces lesions identical to those of vesicular exanthema when inoculated into swine .","it has many distinct serotypes , which are considered to be another range of variants of swine vesicular exanthema virus ."
"therefore , the disease may be transmitted by direct contact and fomites .","spontaneous outbreaks of vesicular exanthema in swine due to san miguel sea lion virus have not been documented , though undiagnosed vesicular disease of swine , associated with the feeding of marine products , has occurred in tasmania and new zealand ."
"after inoculation , there is an incubation period of about to hr , followed by fever and development of vesicles on the mouth , lips , tongue , on the mucosa of the oral cavity , and on the sole of the hoof , coronary band , and interdigital skin .","occasionally , they are present on the teats of nursing sows and on the skin of the metacarpus and metatarsus ."
"the economic importance of swine vesicular disease is related to losses in production and the fact that it is difficult to differentiate from other vesicular diseases in swine , including foot and mouth disease .","the disease was first recognized in italy in , and it has since been reported from hong kong , the united kingdom , europe , and asia ."
"the cause of swine vesicular disease is a small rna virus belonging to the picornaviridae , genus enterovirus .","it is considered to be a porcine strain of human coackie b5 enterovirus and occasionally infects humans , but not other domestic species ."
"transmission within affected herds is by direct contact , especially during the early stages of the disease .",most outbreaks of swine vesicular disease appear to originate by feeding raw garbage contaminated with pork products .
"vesicles on the mouth , lips , and tongue occur in clusters , and they are small , mm in diameter , white , and opaque .","well - demarcated areas of necrosis , resembling superficial abrasions , extend to the metacarpus , metatarsus , and interdigital cleft ."
"spongiosis is less prominent in swine vesicular disease , compared to vesicular stomatitis , although this depends to some extent on the location of the vesicle .","there is an intense leukocytic reaction in the necrotic areas , which is mainly neutrophilic ."
a moderate mononuclear - cell reaction and fibroplasia may be evident in the underlying dermis .,"necrosis and inflammation involve the external root sheath of hair follicles and the subepithelial glands , especially of the mouth ."
the characteristic lesions are those of a nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis involving most areas in the brain .,nervous signs and lesions have been reported in field outbreaks and reproduced eerimentally in swine vesicular disease .
mucosal disease was described in in the united states as a disease with a morbidity rate of to % and a mortality rate of %.,"it was characterized by an initial febrile reaction , mucoid nasal discharge , anorexia , constant or intermittent watery diarrhea with feces often containing blood , rapid dehydration , and death ."
infection with bovine virus diarrhea virus results in a spectrum of signs that are compatible with both clinical syndromes : virus diarrhea and mucosal disease .,"the causative agent of bovine virus diarrhea is an rna virus belonging to the togaviridae , genus pestivirus ."
"depending on the stage of gestation , it may cause abortion , fetal mummification , or a wide spectrum of teratogenic lesions , including microencephaly , cerebellar hypoplasia and dysgenesis , hydranencephaly , hydrocephalus , and defective myelination of the spinal cord .","ocular lesions , such as microphthalmia , cataracts , retinal degeneration , atrophy and dysplasia , and optic neuritis , have all been associated with fetal infections by the virus ( see the nervous system , volume ) ."
"affected animals are termed "" hairy shakers "" ( see the skin and appendages , and the nervous system , volume ) .","a condition in lambs , termed border disease , which is characterized by a hairy fleece , clonic rhythmic tremors , and unthriftiness , has been associated with prenatal infection by a togavirus that has a strong antigenic relationship to bovine virus diarrhea and hog cholera viruses ."
a slight fever with leukopenia at the third day is followed by a second phase of higher fever and more severe leukopenia at about the seventh day .,all virulent strains of virus produce the same sort of eerimental disease in susceptible calves .
"white necrotic foci - 2 mm in size , surrounded by a margin of hyperemia , then appear on the muzzle and the buccal mucosa .","discrete oral lesions are preceded by an acute catarrhal stomatitis and pharyngitis , the mucosae being hyperemic and pink and covered by a thin , gray film of catarrhal exudate ."
"the temperature returns to normal in to days , and then oral lesions and a watery diarrhea develop .","the nasal discharge becomes more mucinous in a couple of days and dries on the muzzle , causing excoriation ."
in most acute cases the ruminal content is usually liquid and putrid .,"the lesions on the wall of the rumen resemble those present elsewhere in the upper alimentary tract , and although they occur anywhere , they are best seen on the pillars and other smooth or nonvillous portions of the mucosa ( fig ."
"in some abomasa , mucous metaplasia may be patchy but widespread and may reflect inflammation in the mucosa .","there is some edema , hemorrhage , and modest leukocytic infiltration of the submucosa ."
in some cases the mucosa of the small intestine may have patchy or diffuse congestion .,"in rare cases , fibrin casts may be in the lumen of the small bowel ."
a mild to moderate mononuclear inflammatory cell reaction is frequently present in the walls of the vessels and in perivascular areas .,"the vascular lesions are not limited to the intestine but may be present in a variety of other organs such as the heart , brain , and adrenal cortices , which may make it difficult to differentiate the disease from malignant catarrhal fever ."
"microscopically , the mesenteric lymph nodes show a diminished population of lymphocytes and necrosis of germinal centers .","similar lesions may be seen in the splenic lymphoid follicles , but they are not consistent and are difficult to interpret ."
fungal hyphae are found invading the stroma and causing thrombosis in venules .,"the lesions are areas of hemorrhagic necrosis involving the mucosa , submucosa , and sometimes deeper layers of the wall ."
"punctate hemorrhages with ulcers - 3 mm in diameter may be profuse in the oral cavity , excepting the dorsum of the tongue , and in the esophagus , larynx , trachea , conjunctiva , and abomasum .",enteric lesions of the disease may be observed in the fetus .
these animals may be chronic shedders of virus and are an important source of infection for other animals .,"although they do not show any evidence of infection clinically , they have microscopic lesions in the kidney and brain ."
"antigen is also present in the neurons , especially of the cerebral cortex .","the neurons are pyknotic , and there is astrocytic and lymphocytic neuronal satellitosis ."
"it is now enzootic in tropical africa , the middle east , and the orient , to which places it is restricted by sanitary precautions .","unfortunately , the long and interesting history of its pandemic plunges across continents cannot be followed here ."
"once adapted , the virus causes fever and characteristic grayish white , granular necrotic patches in the intestinal lymphoid tissue .","goats and sheep do respond , but inconsistently , to artificial inoculation , although their susceptibility to rinderpest in the field is unclear ."
control of the disease in endemic areas is impeded by difficulties inherent in systems of husbandry and in the coexistence of cattle with large populations of susceptible ungulate wildlife .,"the virus of rinderpest is antigenically uniform and , when suitably modified , is an effective vaccine ."
"the different degrees of severity are in part due to real differences in virulence of strains , and largely due to differences in susceptibility of breeds or races of cattle .","the disease in cattle may be mild , especially in endemic areas , but probably will be acute or peracute in new foci ."
this occurs so readily that erosions are usually the first lesions observed .,"their margins are sharp , and the bases are reddened by the underlying congested capillaries ."
"lesions in the small intestine are less severe than those elsewhere but are of the same general character , streaks of congestion and erosion developing on the margins of mucosal folds .",they are best developed in the upper duodenum and in the ileum .
"the peyer ' s patches and other gastrointestinal lymphoid follicles , especially at the cecocolic junction , become necrotic ( fig .","4 d ) , and this may be extensive enough to cause necrosis of the overlying mucosa , leaving lesions resembling deep ulcers ."
"hemorrhages beneath the epicardium and endocardium are common but nonspecific , and there may be mild nonspecific myocardial degeneration .","petechiae are common in the upper respiratory mucosae , and small erosions may develop on the larynx ."
"it does not infect cattle through contact ; however , eerimental infection stimulates antibody formation in cattle that is protective against challenge with rinderpest virus .",the virus cross - reacts with rinderpest virus in the immunodiffusion and complement fixation tests .
the cytopathic effect in calf thyroid monolayers is characterized by formation of intranuclear basophilic ( cowdry type a ) inclusions and syncytia .,serial culture requires the transfer of cells because free virus is not present in the culture fluids .
eerimental inoculation of cattle with this virus failed to induce clinical disease .,"a herpesvirus , morphologically and immunologically similar to that causing the african form , has been identified in cell cultures infected with material from an outbreak of malignant catarrhal fever in dairy cattle in minnesota ."
"eerimentally , the disease can be transmitted with large quantities of whole blood and lymphoid tissue , but not by cell - free filtrates .","this indicates that the agent is cell associated , probably with lymphocytes ."
"gross morbid changes may not be present in animals that die of peracute malignant catarrhal fever , and in these the diagnosis must rest on the detection of the characteristic histologic changes and positive results of transmission eeriments .","with the sheep - associated disease , diagnosis is based usually on the microscopic findings ."
"the tracheobronchial mucosa is hyperemic and usually petechiated , but ulceration may occur , and in a small percentage of cases a pseudomembranous tracheobronchitis is present ( fig .",the pharyngeal and laryngeal mucosae are hyperemic and swollen and later develop multiple erosions or ulcerations and are often covered in part by grayish yellow pseudomembranes .
sometimes appar - ently normal epithelium on the surface of the tongue peels off in sheets ( fig .,minor erosions are first observed on the lips adjacent to the mucocutaneous junction .
there may be numerous small hemorrhages and a few erosions of the mucous membrane of the gallbladder .,"the liver is slightly enlarged ; close inspection will reveal , in some cases , a diffuse mottling with white foci that are periportal accumulations of mononuclear cells ."
electron microscopic studies in these cases have shown that the endothelial reaction consists primarily of lymphocytes and macrophages rather than endothelial cells .,"in some forms of the eerimental disease , fibrinoid necrosis , endothelial - cell hyperplasia , and thrombosis are not prominent ."
"fortunately for diagnostic purposes , arteritis is present in all cases of malignant catarrhal fever , whether peracute , acute , or mild with recovery , but it may be necessary to examine many sections to find it .","these changes in the blood vessels strongly suggest malignant catarrhal fever ; arteritis may be seen in bovine virus diarrhea , however , mainly in the submucosa in the lower alimentary tract ."
the long incubation period and prepatent viremic stage are also suggestive of an immune - mediated disease .,the pathogenesis of the vascular lesions is discussed with the cardiovascular system ( volume ) .
microscopic arteritis similar to that present in other organs occurs in the nervous system of many cases .,"necrotizing arteritis , plasma exudation into the menginges or virchow - robin space , and the predominantly adventitial lymphocytic response are , in cattle , unique to malignant catarrhal fever and allow it to be differentiated from other nonsuppurative encephalitides ( fig ."
the dermis or propria ( and often the epithelium ) is diffusely infiltrated with a mainly lymphocytic cell population .,"the dermis , especially its superficial portion , is edematous , and typical arteritis , involving small - and mediumsized vessels , is present ."
"the pathogenesis of the epithelial lesions has been compared to other lymphocyte - mediated reactions such as tuberculin , contact hypersensitivities , and graft rejection .","the severity of the lesions in the oral squamous mucosa is , in eerimental cases at least , related to the degree of lymphoidcell infiltration in the mucosa and underlying lamina propria rather than to the vascular thrombosis , which is minimal ."
"these changes in the epithelium and its lamina propria account for the macroscopic lesions in the vagina , prepuce , bladder , and although there is often much less hemorrhage , oral cavity , nasal mucosa , esophagus , and forestomach .","although gross lesions are not present in the salivary glands , there are microscopic degenerative changes in the epithelium of the interlobular and excretory ducts , with multiple foci of parenchymal necrosis associated with arteritis ."
"in the liver , these cuffs may be very large and invest the branches of the hepatic artery , which may undergo fibrinoid necrosis .","microscopic lesions are rather consistently present in the kidneys , even though gross lesions are not ; they consist of vasculitis involving the smaller arteries and afferent arterioles ( fig ."
"in the small intestine and large bowel , the lesion resembles ischemic damage .","in the abomasum , the glandular epithelium in affected areas becomes basophilic , cuboidal , or flattened mucous in type ; eventually necrosis and focal ulceration occur ."
focal areas of necrosis and desquamation may be evident over regions that are heavily infiltrated by lymphocytes .,"the microscopic lesions in the joints are characterized by a marked , mainly lymphocytic reaction in the synovial membrane and underlying connective tissue , especially in the perivascular areas ."
"rather constantly , there are vascular lesions of this sort in the neurohypophysis , but not the adenohypophysis , and in the adrenal glands .","these same changes may be found in any tissue , however , even in the absence of gross lesions ."
"the african form of the disease may be confirmed by the isolation of the causative virus on bovine tissue cell cultures , especially thyroid .",the diagnosis of the sheep - associated form is based on clinicopathologic findings and may be confirmed by reproduction of the disease following inoculation of whole blood into susceptible species .
"immunity to one serotype does not confer resistance against another and may cause "" sensitization , "" with a more severe syndrome following infection by second type .","there are more than recognized serotypes of bluetongue virus dis - tinguished by neutralization tests , though they may represent not so much distinct types as points in a spectrum of antigenicity brought about by recombination of the segmented orbivirus genome ."
"cattle , among domestic animals , may play a major role as reservoir or overwintering host for bluetongue , since inapparent or latent infection may persist for a number of years , and recrudescence of viremia may be stimulated by the bites of culicoides .","both viruses may be involved simultaneously in outbreaks of hemorrhagic disease in wild ruminants , and both have been isolated from culicoides in a single locality at the same time ."
"this is reflected microscopically by the presence of swollen endothelium , and fibrin and platelet thrombi in small vessels , with edema and hemorrhage in surrounding tissue .",these lesions in turn mediate the full spectrum of gross findings .
"hyperemia and edema of the eyelids and conjunctiva may occur , and edema of lips , ears , and the intermandibular area becomes apparent .","hyperemia may extend over the muzzle and the skin of much of the body , including the axillary and inguinal areas ."
"bruiselike gelatinous hemorrhages and contusions , which may be small and easily overlooked if not numerous , are often present in the subcutis and intermuscular fascial planes .","focal or multifocal pallid areas of streaky myodegeneration may be present throughout the carcass , perhaps partly obscured by petechial or ecchymotic hemorrhage ."
necrosis may be present deep in the papillary muscle of the left ventricle and perhaps elsewhere in the myocardium .,"the lesion that is perhaps most consistent and closest to pathognomonic for bluetongue is focal hemorrhage , petechial or up to cm wide by to cm long , in the tunica media at the base of the pulmonary artery ."
"in severe cases the lungs may assume a purplish hue , with marked edematous separation of lobules .",there may also be edema and petechial or ecchymotic hemorrhage in the pharyngeal and laryngeal area .
petechial hemorrhage of the mucosa of the gallbladder may also be seen .,"the remainder of the intestinal mucosa may be congested , and occasionally there may be hemorrhage , particularly in the large bowel ."
"acute lesions are characterized microscopically by microvascular thrombosis , and edema and hemorrhage , in affected sites recognized at autopsy .","in squamous mucosa and skin , capillaries of the proprial and dermal papillae are involved , resulting in vacuolation and necrosis of overlying epithelium ."
"sloughing or cracking of crusts of necrotic epithelium also may occur on affected parts of the skin , but the ulcerative or erosive defects heal readily .",viral antigen and thrombosis are present in small vessels in affected tissues during the acute phase .
necrotizing aspiration pneumonia is a sequel to dysphagia in some animals .,"ischemic necrosis and hemorrhage of the striated muscle in the tongue , pharynx , larynx , and esophagus causes the difficulty in swallowing seen clinically , and similar changes are seen in other skeletal muscles ."
"the hemorrhagic diseases in bighorn sheep , pronghorn antelope , and white - tailed and black - tailed or mule deer in north america tend to resemble bluetongue in sheep .","white - tailed deer may develop a particularly severe and fulminant acute hemorrhagic disease , with high mortality ."
"in japan , ibaraki disease must in addition be differentiated , at least clinically , from ephemeral fever , and this would be the case in parts of australia were the disease introduced into that continent .","in cattle , the condition must be differentiated from foot and mouth disease , vesicular stomatitis , bovine virus diarrhea , rinderpest , malignant head catarrh , and photosensitivity ."
"in sheep , bluetongue infection of ewes early in gestation may result in hydranencephaly .","anomalous calves produced by bluetongue - infected cattle have excessive gingiva , an enlarged tongue , anomalous maxillae , dwartlike build , and rotations and contractures of the distal extremities ."
"it is generally an insignificant disease but needs to be differentiated from other , more serious diseases affecting the oral cavity and skin .","it is caused by a dna virus belonging to the poxviridae , genus parapoxvirus ."
"the disease is more common in calves than in older animals , although the susceptibility of the latter may be increased by intercurrent debility or disease .","infection does not confer significant immunity , and successive crops of lesions and relapses can occur ."
"shortly , the central portion becomes elevated as a low papule , although the elevation is not easy to see , and by the second day a grayish central zone of epithelial hyperplasia has developed on which there is superficial scaliness and necrosis .","the lesions eand slowly to assume a "" c o i n "" shape , maintaining a hyperemic periphery and grayish center ; the central necrotic area may slough to form a shallow craterous defect surrounded by a slightly raised red margin ."
"variation in the extent and gross appearance of the lesions is to be eected , depending on the usual host - parasite factors and the nature of superimposed infections .",papular stomatitis is probably more common and widespread than reports indicate .
"in the upper alimentary tract they may consist of focal red , raised areas , which coalesce to form papules followed by pustules .","the latter rupture , and on the muzzle and in the mouth they may become covered by a gray to brown scab , although scab formation may not occur in the mucosa of the upper alimentary tract ."
bovine herpesvirus type has been associated with a wide range of clinicopathologic conditions in cattle .,"these include necrotizing rhinotracheitis , infectious pustular vaginitis and balanoposthitis , encephalitis , abortions , and latent infection ( see appropriate chapters ) ."
"characteristically , the lesions tend to be punctate with a slightly raised margin ; the necrotic areas are covered by grayish white layer of fibrinonecrotic exudate , which leaves a raw , red base when removed .","the oral and nasal mucosae are hyperemic , and focal areas of necrosis , erosion , and ulceration , a few millimeters up to cm in diameter , are located on the nares , dental pad , gums , buccal mucosa , palate , and caudal , ventral , and dorsal surfaces of the tongue ."
"the earliest lesions consist of foci of necrosis and hemorrhage , a few millimeters in diameter .","in some cases , the necrosis may involve almost the entire surface of the ruminal mucosa , which becomes covered by a thick , dirty gray layer of exudate , resembling curdled milk , that adheres tightly to the wall ( fig ."
"when present , the respiratory lesions are similar to those described for older cattle , although they are milder and generally limited to the nasal mucosa , larynx , and upper third of the trachea ( see the respiratory system , this volume ) .",the enteric lesions may be accompanied by changes in the upper respiratory tract .
"cowdry type a and b inclusions may be present in epithelial cells in the periphery of the lesion , although these are an inconsistent finding .",they are more likely to be found if tissues are collected in the early stages of the disease and fixed in bouin ' s fluid .
"the ruminal lesions must be differentiated from those of bovine adenovirus infection and nonspecific rumenitis , described elsewhere in this chapter .","the liver lesions may be confused with focal necrosis associated with septicemias , for example , listeriosis or salmonellosis ( see liver and biliary system , this volume ) ."
"the name caprine herpesvirus - 1 has been suggested for this virus , which grows on embryonic bovine lung tissue cultures and causes severe systemic disease with erosions and ulcerations of the alimentary tract in neonatal goats .",has been isolated from neonatal goat kids in califor - nia and switzerland .
these are particularly prominent on the gums around the incisor teeth and to a lesser extent in the pharynx and esophagus .,"round or longitudinal erosions , which have a hyperemic border , are evident in the oral mucosa ."
"focal areas of necrosis in other organs , such as liver , spleen , and adrenal glands , which are often present in calves , are not reported in the goats .",the alimentary lesions in goat kids in many respects resemble the lesions in calves infected with bovine herpesvirus type .
feline viral rhinotracheitis virus ( feline herpesvirus - 1 ) causes alimentary tract lesions ( see erosive and ulcerative stomatitides ) .,"viruses antigenically related to feline herpesvirus - 1 have been isolated from dogs with diarrhea , but descriptions of lesions are not available ."
"in many areas there is a high prevalence of antibodies , indicating that infection is common , but overt disease is sporadic .","there are different serotypes of bovine adenovirus , and this number is likely to increase ."
in some cases the areas of necrosis coalesce to give rise to a diffuse necrotizing rumenitis .,"those in the forestomachs are characterized by irregular , raised , red to gray necrotic areas mm in diameter on the mucosa of both the dorsal and ventral sacs of the rumen ."
"in feedlot cattle , the lesions may be most prominent in the colon .","the mucosa is dark red , and there is marked edema of the mesocolon ."
"ultrastructurally , adenovirus particles are located in large numbers in the nuclei of endothelial cells .","typical inclusions may also be found in endothelial cells of vessels and sinusoids of the adrenal glands , mesenteric lymph nodes , liver , spleen , glomeruli , and interstitial capillaries in the kidney and in the mucosa of the urinary bladder ."
"the latter is often difficult because different serotypes and strains of the virus require specific tissue cell cultures , and several blind passages may be required before cytopathic changes are evident .","confirmation of enteric bovine adenovirus infection depends on the demonstration of the typical intranuclear inclusions in endothelial cells , the ultrastructural presence of virus particles , and isolation of the virus in tissue cell cultures ."
"asymptomatic infections are most common in swine , and the virus may be isolated from normal pigs .",serotype appears to be the most widely distributed strain of the virus in europe and north america .
diarrhea has also been produced eerimentally with serotype and other strains of the virus .,"other lesions produced with serotype are interstitial pneumonia , nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis , and focal interstitial nephritis ."
"in later stages of the infection , the inclusions are smaller and are surrounded by a halo .","the infected nuclei are enlarged , round , and displaced to the apical portion of the cell ."
"the cell membrane and microvilli are irregular , and the terminal web is absent .","the rough endoplasmic reticulum shows local distension , with formation of large multivesicular bodies ."
"a survey in canada revealed that % of - day - to - week - old pigs had adenovirus inclusions in enterocytes , mainly in the ileum .",the presence of inclusions in enterocytes must be interpreted with caution .
the foal had diarrhea and progressive weight loss over a - month period .,there is a single case report of an unidentified alimentary tract adenovirus infection in an arabian foal that did not have lesions of combined immunodeficiency .
typical adenoviral inclusions were found at all levels of the small intestine .,"these were most commonly located in the villous epithelial cells , less often in the crypts , and only occasionally in the submucosal glands ."
"serotype replicates and persists in the alimentary tract of sheep , but there is no information on the pathogenesis and lesions associated with the virus in this site .","has been recovered , in france , from feces of diarrheic lambs that also had coccidiosis ."
"among domestic mammals , they cause mainly enteric infections ; the major exceptions are feline infectious peritonitis and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus of swine .","coronaviruses cause disease affecting a number of organ systems in a variety of species , many of which are outside our scope ."
"there are antigenic relationships among some viruses from various hosts , and eerimental crossinfection will occur between some host species , generally without pathologic consequences .",the coronaviruses infecting each species of host appear to be distinctive ; some species are infected by more than one type of coronavirus .
"profuse diarrhea usually begins about the time that early cytologic changes become apparent , but before there is extensive epithelial exfoliation .","damaged epithelium may lyse in situ , releasing virus retained in cytoplasmic vacuoles , or it may exfoliate into the lumen ."
"the enterocytes present on villi shortly after the initial exfoliative episode are mainly poorly differentiated , low columnar , cuboidal , or squamous cells , with stubby irreg - ular microvilli .","within or days , villi begin to regenerate and the epithelium becomes progressively more columnar , though still lacking a well - developed brush border and its complement of enzymes ."
"remission of signs occurs within about to days as regeneration of villi occurs , providing the animal survives the dehydration , electrolyte depletion , and acidosis brought about by diarrhea .",mechanisms of diarrhea in villus atrophy have been discussed under pathophysiology of enteric disease .
"transmissible gastroenteritis virus and coronavirus ( porcine epizootic diarrhea virus ) both cause syndromes of acute diarrheal disease in all age groups , and chronic diarrhea and runting in weaned pigs .","in some areas , coronaviruses , especially transmissible gasteroenteritis , are the major cause of diarrhea in neonatal swine ."
introduction of virus into a naive herd results in a rapid spread of disease with high morbidity affecting all age groups .,the epizootiology of transmissible gastroenteritis depends on the overall immune status of the herd and of the various age groups within the herd .
"the population of epithelium susceptible to infection on each villus is therefore large , and the capacity to regenerate new enterocytes is small .","by ~ 3 weeks of age , villi are about | xm long , and crypts are longer and their epithelium is actively proliferative , so that the villus : crypt ratio is of the order of : 1 or : 1 ."
yellow granular deposits may be evident in the renal medulla and pelvis .,"the carcass is dehydrated , and there is usually evidence of diarrhea at the perineum ."
"in animals beyond the neonatal age group , atrophy may not be so severe and readily recognized under the dissecting microscope , and the contrast with the normally shorter villi in the duodenum of older pigs is not as marked .","lesions may be patchy , and several areas of lower small intestine must be examined before atrophy is considered not to be present ."
"the differential diagnosis of diarrhea in suckling and weanling pigs includes , in piglets less than days of age , transmissible gastroenteritis and enterotoxic e . coli diarrhea as the main candidates , with cv777 and clostridial enterotoxemia a possibility .","piglets days of age to weaning may have transmissible gastroenteritis , cv777 , rotavirus , adenovirus , isospora , strongyhides , or enteropathic e . coli infection ."
"the virus is capable of infecting absorptive epithelium in the full length of the small intestine , and in the large bowel .",viral antigen is also found in macrophages in the lamina propria of villi and in mesenteric lymph nodes .
"in the small intestine , villus atrophy is rarely as severe as that seen in neonatal swine .","rather , villi are moderately shortened or have subtotal atrophy , with a villusxrypt ratio of about : 1 or : 1 ."
"a moderate mixed inflammatory reaction is present in the lamina propria , and neutrophils may be in damaged glands or effusing into the lumen through superficial microerosions .","in the colon during the early phase of infection , surface epithelium may be exfoliating , flattened and squamous , or eroded in patchy areas , and some colonic glands lined by flattened epithelium will contain exfoliated cells and necrotic debris ."
"rotavirus , cryptosporidium , and combined infections must be considered in calves - 15 days of age .","infectious bovine rhinotracheitis , salmonellosis , and bovine virus diarrhea must also be considered ."
"coronaviruses were at first associated with the pandemic of diarrhea in dogs in , which was subsequent demonstrated to be due to canine parvovirus - 2 .","coronavirus is probably widely prevalent in the dog population , but a cause of diarrhea in only a minority of animals ."
"there was watery content in the lumen of the small and large intestine , and in the cecum and colon fibrin mixed with some blood was evident .","in the only available report of lesions due to spontaneous canine coronavirus infection , however , colonic infection and lesions were demonstrated ."
"demonstration of coronavirus particles in intestinal content or feces in association with villus atrophy and / or acute mucosal colitis , and preferably , demonstration of virus - infected cells under the electron microscope , would confirm an etiologic diagnosis in dogs .","it seems , therefore , that canine coronavirus must be differentiated from common causes of small bowel diarrhea in the young dog , especially parvovirus infection , rotavirus infection , and coccidiosis , and from other forms of acute mucosal colitis ."
feline infectious peritonitis is caused by a coronavirus that cross - reacts serologically with the virus of transmissible gastroenteritis in swine .,our understanding of the enteric implications of the coronavirus infections of cats is still confused .
no eerimental confirmation of the pathogenicity of coronavirus in sheep is available .,"coronaviruses have been recovered from the feces of sheep with transient diarrhea , and they have been associated with severe villus atrophy in several spontaneous outbreaks of diarrhea ."
"members of the genus rotavirus , in the reoviridae , infect the gastrointestinal tract of a very wide range of mammals and birds .",in the earlier literature they are frequently referred to as reoviruslike .
"microvilli become irregular and somewhat stunted , and there may be some blebbing of membranes .","infected enterocytes lose cytoplasmic electron density , and mitochondria swell , as does the cell generally ."
"the mucosal surface is covered by cuboidal , poorly differentiated epithelium that has an ill - defined microvillous border and may contain lipid droplets in the cytoplasm .","diarrhea is mediated probably by electrolyte and nutrient malabsorption , perhaps exacerbated by the effect of cryptal secretion ."
"diarrhea may be produced in calves by rotavirus infection alone , but the condition is usually considered to be relatively mild or transient in comparison with that induced by enterotoxic e . coli or coronavirus .",combinations of agents including rotavirus are frequently involved in outbreaks of diarrhea in neonatal calves .
"the pathogenesis and lesions of rotavirus infection in lambs are like those caused in other species , with the exception that viral infection of the colon may occur .",rotavirus may cause diarrhea in neonatal lambs alone or in combination with enterotoxic e . coli and cryptosporidium .
limited eerimental work indicates that rotavirus alone or in combination with enterotoxic e . coli is capable of inducing diarrhea in foals .,"the natural and eerimental disease resembles that seen in other species , with significant viral infection limited to enterocytes in the small intestine , where villus atrophy occurs ."
"diarrhea , occasionally fatal , may be caused by rotavirus infection in young puppies , especially those less than or weeks of age .","little information is available on the pathology of the disease in naturally or eerimentally infected animals , but it is presumably like that in other species ."
"feline panleukopenia virus and canine parvovirus - 2 will infect the heterologous host when inoculated parenterally , apparently without producing significant disease .","feline panleukopenia virus , mink enteritis virus , and canine parvovirus - 2 are each biologically distinct , varying somewhat in their hemagglutination characteristics , in vitro host - cell ranges , infectivity , and virulence in eerimentally inoculated hosts ."
"in older animals , the proliferative elements of the enteric epithelium , hematopoietic , and lymphoid tissue are particularly susceptible .","at the time of virus assembly , large basophilic or amphophilic feulgenpositive intranuclear inclusions may be found in infected cells , especially in bouin ' s - fixed tissues ."
"peyer ' s patches are consistently infected at all levels of the intestine , and epithelium in crypts oif lieberkuhn over or adjacent to peyer ' s patches usually becomes infected a day or so later .",it follows primary viral replication in lymphoid tissue and the resulting dissemination of virus by circulating lymphocytes and cell - free viremia .
"in some survivors , focal villus atrophy is associated with local "" drop out ' ' of crypts completely destroyed by infection .","rarely , in animals recovering from acute disease , chronic malabsorption and protein - losing enteropathy are associated with persistent areas of ulceration caused by more extensive loss of crypts and collapse of the mucosa ."
the relatively low rate of replication of intestinal epithelium in germ - free cats elains failure to produce significant intestinal lesions and clinical panleukopenia in eerimentally infected animals .,"in spontaneous cases , the lower prevalence of parvoviral lesions in the colon and stomach , in comparison with the small intestine , reflects the relatively lower rate of epithelial proliferation in those tissues ."
"hypoproteinemia is common , and anemia may occur in severely affected animals ; both are exacerbated by rehydration .","dehydration and electrolyte depletion are the result of reduced fluid intake , enteric malabsorption , effusion of tissue fluid , and in some animals , vomition ."
"this is due to failure of recruitment from the marrow , and peripheral consumption , especially in the intestine .","transient neutropenia , of about or days duration , occurs consistently in cats , and less commonly in dogs ."
"virus - infected cells still may be detected in crypts and peyer ' s patches at this time , and virus complexed with antibody may be found in feces or intestinal content by direct electron microscopy .","attempts to isolate virus from tissues or feces after several days of clinical disease or at death , however , are often thwarted by the fact that virus is neutralized by antibody present in tissue fluids ."
infection of proliferating cardiac myocytes in young puppies with canine parvovirus - 2 results in a nonsuppurative myocarditis and sequelae of acute or chronic heart failure .,"rarely , however , a syndrome of generalized infection may occur in neonatal dogs ."
"panleukopenia virus is ubiquitous in environments frequented by cats , and infection is common , though generally subclinical .","the disease usually occurs in young animals eed after decay of passively acquired maternal antibody , but it may occur in naive cats of any age ."
enteric lesions may be subtle and easily overlooked in some cases .,the thymus is markedly involuted and reduced in mass in young animals .
"however , turgidity is difficult to assess in the intestine of the cat .","the content is usually foul smelling , scant , watery , and yellowish gray at all levels of the intestine ."
crypts appear dilated and are lined by cuboidal or more severely attenuated epithelium .,"intranuclear inclusions may be found , and there is exfoliation of damaged epithelium into the lumen of crypts ."
"if cryptal damage is severe and widespread , the mucosa becomes thin and eroded or ulcerated , with effusion of tissue fluids , fibrin , and erythrocytes .","inflammatory cells are usually sparse in the gut of such animals , and superficial masses of bacteria may be present , occasionally accompanied by locally invasive fungal hyphae or pseudohyphae ."
"lesions in the colon generally resemble those found in the small bowel , though they are frequently less severe or more patchy in distribution .","when sought , colonic lesions are found in about half of fatal cases of panleukopenia ."
"in severely affected animals at the nadir of the leukopenia , virtually all proliferating elements in the bone marrow may be depleted .","the extremely hypocellular , moderately congested marrow is populated only by scattered stem cells ."
application of fluorescent - antibody or immunoperoxidase techniques may identify viral antigen in tissue as late as to days after infection .,inclusions may be sought in these tissues but are usually present in significant numbers only during the late incubation and early clinical period .
it appeared spontaneously and virtually simultaneously in populations of dogs on several continents in and rapidly spread worldwide .,canine parvovirus - 2 infection presumably resulted by mutation of the virus of feline panleukopenia .
"dogs with typical disease due to canine parvovirus - 2 become anorectic and lethargic and may vomit and develop diarrhea , perhaps in association with transient moderate pyrexia .",relative or absolute lymphopenia or leukopenia of or days duration may occur .
"there is often segmental or widespread subserosal hemorrhage , often extending into the muscularis and submucosa of the intestine .",the serosa frequently appears granular due to superficial fibrinous effusion ( fig .
"however , interstitial pneumonitis is commonly found and may be a function of uncomplicated viral infection .","pulmonary lesions such as alveolar septal thickening by mononuclear cells , congestion , and effusion of edema fluid and fibrin into the lumina of alveoli may be related in part to terminal gram - negative sepsis ."
"the disease must be differentiated from canine coronavirus infection , which appears to be very rarely fatal , and from canine intestinal hemorrhage syndrome , shock gut , intoxication with heavy metals or warfarin , infectious canine hepatitis , and other causes of hemorrhagic diathesis .",involution of gut - associated lymphoid tissue caused by parvovirus must be differentiated from that due to canine distemper .
the pathology of natural or eerimental infections has not been described .,"viral antigen has been identified by immunofluorescence in the nuclei of epithelium in intestinal crypts and in cells in thymus , lymph nodes , adrenal glands , and heart muscle , suggesting similarities to the pathogenesis of feline panleukopenia and canine parvovirus - 2 ."
these are the ability to colonize the intestine and the capacity to produce toxins that stimulate secretion of electrolyte and water by the intestinal mucosa .,two major attributes confer virulence on certain diarrheagenic strains of e . coli .
the cell receptors have not been clearly defined ; carbohydrate moieties in mucosal glycolipids are probably involved .,the pilar adhesins are distinct from type fimbriae present on many strains of e . coli .
adhesin k99 is also found on some strains infecting swine and is the only adhesin known to promote e . coli colonization in calves and lambs .,"enterotoxic strains of e . coli lacking k88 , k99 , and p , but adherent to porcine enterocytes , are also recognized ."
coli to colonize the small intestine is greatest in animals only a few days old .,"stimulation of maternal immunity to appropriate pilus antigens causes antibody secretion in the milk , which agglutinates adhesins and prevents colonization of the gut of suckling animals ."
"in strains of e . coli causing diarrhea in animals , adhesin and enterotoxin production are generally controlled by separate plasmids .","however , certain combinations of adhesin and toxin tend to occur together ."
"via mediation of camp it causes secretion of chloride , with sodium and water following , from the crypts .","the toxin complex then undergoes dissociation and the a subunit enters the cell , where it stimulates the adenyl cyclase system ."
"this is probably mediated by stimulation of a transmembrane flux of calcium ions by toxin , with intracellular generation of prostaglandins that active guanylate cyclase .","it may act by reducing chloride absorption and perhaps by causing cellular secretion of electrolyte and water , associated with accumulation of intracellular cgmp ."
tissue sections from several levels of the small bowel should be fixed rapidly .,"in order to establish the cause , one or more piglets early in clinical disease should be killed and examined ."
it is sometimes associated with villus fusion later in the course of the disease and as a result may resemble viral lesions .,"cells on the surface of villi may be cuboidal , and subepithelial capillaries may be dilated ."
"though enterotoxic e . coli may be isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes or other parenchymatous tissues at autopsy , systemic invasion is not a significant component of the disease .","enterotoxic colibacillosis must be differentiated from enteric colibacillosis in calves that appears to be due to enteroinvasive strains , and from septicemic colibacillosis ."
enterotoxic colibacillosis in iambs is a significant problem in some areas .,the serotypes involved and pathogenesis and diagnosis of the condition are similar to those in calves .
"the disease may be sporadic or occur as an outbreak , usually affecting the best animals in a group , and mortality often approaches % of affected animals .",rare reports exist of edema disease in suckling and mature animals .
"coli neurotoxin "" ) released in the gut by some serotypes of e . coli ( mainly , , ) is implicated .",the factors predisposing to enteric colonization and adhesion by these strains are unknown .
it is heat labile but is distinguishable from both heat - labile and heat - stable enterotoxins responsible for the secretory diarrhea caused by some strains of e . coli .,"the edema disease principle is not related to "" o "" or "" k "" antigens , nor to the hemolytic trait displayed by most , but not all , strains of e . coli causing the disease ."
the edema disease principle can be neutralized by antitoxin prepared against crude toxin extracts .,it shows specific titratable cytotoxicity for vero cells grown in vitro and also may be assayed by intravenous injection in mice .
"inflammation is not at any stage a prominent component of the angiopathy , nor of the associated edema in most sites , however , and thrombosis of vessels is rarely encountered .",proliferative mesenchymal elements are found in the tunica media and tunica adventitia in more advanced cases .
the gastric submucosal edema should be sought by gently cutting through the muscularis to the submucosa .,"edema of the mesocolon , of the submucosa of the cardiac glandular area of the stomach over the greater curvature , and of mesenteric lymph nodes is most consistently found ."
"in swine dying after a more prolonged clinical course , gross edema often is not present , though enlargement of mesenteric lymph nodes is present in a large proportion of cases .","a few pigs may show usually bilaterally symmetric foci of yellowish malacia in the brain stem at various levels , from basal ganglia to medulla ."
a proportion of animals will also have meningeal edema and distended virchow - robin spaces in the brain .,vascular lesions may not be well developed in pigs dying suddenly .
"in animals with more chronic signs , these strains may have been superseded by others as the dominant e . coli populating the intestine .","in acute cases , heavy growth of hemolytic e . coli of one of the three common serotypes associated with edema disease is usual on culture of the small and large bowel ."
"the two diseases often occur in the same population of pigs , though usually affecting different animals .","typically , postweaning colibacillosis is a disease of high morbidity and variable mortality , with loss of condition in pigs suffering prolonged illness ."
"in other animals , the mucosa of the distal small intestine will be congested and the contents watery and perhaps blood stained or brown with flecks of yellow mucus ( fig .",the mucosa may be normal in color and the content creamy .
"atrophy of villi does not seem to be evident , and diarrhea is presumed to be enterotoxin mediated .","in swine with diarrhea , e . coli is attached to the surface of villi by means not necessarily related to known adhesins ."
"loss of lactogenic immunity , a favorable environment for proliferation of bacterial strains with specific nutrient requirements , and promotion of epithelial colonization by the effects of antecedent rotavirus infection have been variously implicated .",the factors predisposing to the massive colonization of hemolytic e . coli are unclear .
"the fatal disease must be differentiated from edema disease , intestinal adenomatosis complex , salmonellosis , and swine dysentery .",postweaning diarrhea due to uncomplicated rotavirus infection or transmissible gastroenteritis is usually nonfatal .
"although in shigellosis septicemia does not usually occur , bacteria may be present in inflamed mesenteric lymph nodes or liver in some enteroinvasive e . coli infections in laboratory animals .","multiplication of the organism within cells results in local erosion and ulceration , associated with acute inflammation in the mucosa ."
"the gross findings may not be remarkable , or the intestine may appear congested in comparison with that in most diarrheic piglets .","diarrhea in eerimentally infected piglets is described as grayyellow , watery , and containing small clots ."
generalized systemic infection with e . coli occurs commonly in calves and less commonly or sporadically in young animals of the other domestic species .,predisposition to infection is a prerequisite for e . coli septicemia caused by a variety of strains .
the vir plasmid causes production of a toxin lethal in chicks and presumably active in other hosts .,"colicin v enhances the ability of the organism to resist host defense mechanisms , possibly by interfering with phagocytosis or complement activation ."
"these may be limited to mildly congested or blue - red , slightly rubbery lungs and a firm spleen , perhaps with evidence of omphalitis .",mortality in hypogammaglobulinemic neonates may occur acutely with little in the way of abnormal gross findings .
"microscopic lesions resemble those previously described , with more severe congestion , thrombosis , and edema in lungs and , perhaps , other tissues .","in cases not examined by some time after death , clumps of small bacilli may be seen in vessels throughout the body ."
"subacute cases may develop localized infection , often multiple , on serous surfaces , in the joints , meninges , and rarely , anterior chamber of the eye .","fibrinous peritonitis , pleuritis and pericarditis , and fibrinopurulent arthritis and meningitis are commonly found , alone or in variable combinations ."
"fibrinous polyserositis and arthritis are sporadic manifestations of e . coli septicemia in swine and must be differentiated from the more significant haemophilus , mycoplasma , and streptococcus infections causing these lesions .","in lambs , congestion and edema of the mucosa of turbinates and sinuses , perhaps with mucopurulent to hemorrhagic sinusitis , have been described ."
"probably , salmonellosis in animals ( here excepting birds and humans ) should be regarded as many diseases by reason of the variety of animal species that are susceptible , the variety of bacterial species that are pathogenic , and the poorly defined variety of circumstances in which host and pathogen interact to produce the disease .","however , there are some general features of salmonellosis that may be noted here ."
"the more common "" stress "" factors that have been associated with salmonellosis in most species of domestic animals include transportation , starvation , changes in ration , overcrowding , age , pregnancy , parturition , exertion , anesthesia , surgery , intercurrent disease , and oral treatment with antibiotics and anthelmintics .",a few of these factors will be considered in more detail .
less tangible environmental effects are suggested by the seasonal occurrence of salmonellosis in pigs and horses .,"often coupled with close confinement are the rigors attending it , especially during long travel with irregular and inadequate feeding and watering ."
"the best known association is that between the virus of hog cholera and salmonella choleraesuis , an association so close as to have caused early pathologists to disregard the bacterium as a primary pathogen .",there are many examples of enhancement of susceptibility to salmonellosis by intercurrent disease .
"the disease in adult cattle is usually sporadic , and there are often noninfectious predisposing diseases such as parturient paresis , ketosis , mastitis , and parasitic infestations .",the stress of anesthesia and surgery may account for the serious outbreaks of salmonellosis that occur in hospitalized animals at veterinary schools .
the strain must also colonize and invade enterocytes to produce enteritis ; noninvasive strains of salmonella are nonpathogenic .,the ability to cause intestinal secretion is a property of some invasive strains .
"some salmonella species have the ability to adhere to the brush border , but the mechanism by which this occurs is not understood .",adherence of s . typhimurium to the ileal mucosa of germ - free or specific - pathogen - free mice is not associated with o or h antigens or pili .
"bacteria are also located in the lamina propria , mainly in macrophages .",degeneration of microvilli characterized by loss of filamentous cores is associated with close adherence of bacteria .
"salmonella infection stimulates adenyl cyclase activity in the rabbit ileum , but the level of stimulation is considerably less than that produced by cholera toxins .","the camp system may play a role in secretion of fluids into the gut lumen , but the mechanism involved is poorly understood ."
diarrhea is at least in part due to the inability of the damaged colon to absorb this fluid .,"as a result of the fluid erption that occurs , mainly in the lower small intestine , a large volume of fluid reaches the colon ."
this toxin causes extensive detachment of intact vero cells in tissue culture .,the cytolytic activity is probably due to inhibition of protein synthesis rather than being a direct effect of the toxic factor on membrane integrity .
the effects of cytotoxin on the endothelial cells also may be involved in the pathogenesis of these lesions .,the vascular lesions may be due to action of large amounts of endotoxins absorbed through the damaged mucosa or released locally .
"septicemia may be of variable duration and severity , but as a rule , it is rapidly fatal in young animals .","if , however , there is transient bacteremia , the organisms are removed by the fixed macrophages , especially of the spleen , liver , and bone marrow ."
swine especially may carry the organism in the intestine and excrete it in the feces .,"whether salmonella can maintain itself in the intestine is not clear ; to some extent , at least , the fecal flora is likely to depend on intermittent seeding from the gallbladder or from macrophages in the lamina propria and gut - associated lymphoid tissue ."
"many are carriers when they are admitted , and when they are stressed , diarrhea follows .",the high prevalence of salmonellosis in veterinary teaching hospitals has been mentioned .
"hepatic lipidosis seems to be common , but this may be related more to inanition than to the infection .","the visceral lymph nodes are always enlarged , juicy , and often hemorrhagic ."
"in acute cases , there is diffuse and intense hemorrhagic inflammation of the cecum and colon , overshadowing any lesions in the upper intestine and leading rapidly to superficial necrosis of the mucosa and a grayish red pseudomembrane ( fig .",the small intestine may be congested with a mucous or hemorrhagic exudate .
"the tissues of choice for isolation are the mesenteric and ileocolic lymph nodes and gut , which should be ground up and inoculated into enrichment media .","for some unknown reason , salmonella is often difficult to isolate from horses that have typical signs and lesions of the disease ."
"diarrhea is not always present , but when it is , the feces are pulpy , yellow or grayish , and have a very unpleasant odor .",in older calves there is often blood and mucus in the feces .
"with time the jejunum and colon become involved , but the duodenum remains relatively normal .","the intestinal lesions are usually most severe in the ileum , especially during the early stages of the disease ."
"similar erosion , ulceration , and fibrinous effusion occur in the proximal large bowel .",the mucosal damage is usually too extensive to be elained solely on the basis of ischemia due to microvascular thrombosis .
strands of fibrin emerge from the mucosal defects and cover the mucosa .,"ultrastructurally , the lesions are similar to those described above for guinea pigs , except that there is more damage to epithelium in calves eerimentally infected with salmonella typhimurium ."
the organism is recoverable in pure culture from such affected joints and tendon sheaths but may be mixed with corynebacterium and pasteurella in the lungs .,"in chronic salmonellosis , there is almost always an anterior bronchopneumonia , usually with adhesions and small abscesses , and purulent exudation in synovial cavities ."
abortions are common with salmonella dublin and s . muenster but may occur with any serotype .,"other sources , such as feed containing protein of animal origin or bone meal , should be considered when the disease is caused by an uncommon serotype ."
"deprivation of food and water for or days may be sufficient and , coupled with fatigue , is the usual predisposing factor when sheep are transported or confined in holding yards .",deaths usually continue for a week to days after debilitating circumstances have been remedied .
salmonella dublin is increasing in prevalence in great britain and the midwestern states of the united states .,"the serotypes usually found in sheep are salmonella ry - phimurium , s . arizona , and s . enteritidis ."
the bacteria are carried in the intestine but also in the regional lymph nodes of the alimentary tract so that carrier animals may not excrete the organism in the feces .,"many serotypes of salmonella have been isolated from swine , and with poultry they form the most important reservoir of the organism ."
"salmonella typhimurium most commonly causes acute or chronic enterocolitis , including a necrotizing proctitis that may lead to rectal structure .",sporadic infections with s . dublin have also been associated with septicemia in nursing pigs .
beneath the visceral pleura there are small dark foci of hemorrhage .,"the lungs are wet , and there is fluid in the interlobular tissue ."
the enlargement of the spleen and absence of infarcts distinguish salmonellosis from hog cholera .,"there may be petechiae on the capsule , but the small marginal infarcts of hog cholera or the larger ones of porcine erysipelas are not present ."
"occasionally , almost every lobule is affected , and the lesions may resemble those of hepatosis dietetica .","they may be scattered at random throughout the liver or grouped , often at the edge of a lobe ."
"in some , there are petechiae in the pelvic and ureteral epithelium .","in almost all cases , hemorrhages are present beneath the epithelium of the bladder ."
"there may be a catarrhal enteritis , or more frequently , the enteritis is hemorrhagic , increasing in severity lower in the tract and terminating in a hemorrhagic ileitis .","the mucosae of the colon and cecum may be normal , but if the course if prolonged , there is hyperemia or fibrinohemorrhagic inflammation ."
"it is more usual to have an increase in the volume of fluid with red , velvety hypertrophy of the synovial villi .","localization sometimes occurs in synovial membranes , producing poly synovitis and sometimes polyarthritis ."
button ulcers that occur along the cecum and colon are to be distinguished from nonspecific ulcers that occasionally occur on and about the ileocecal valve .,necrotic enteritis due to secondary invasion of the eroded ileum and large bowel by pathogenic anaerobes and balantidium coli may also supervene .
"the discoloration of the skin is initially due to intense dilation , congestion , and thrombosis of capillaries and venules in the dermal papilla .",there is activation and necrosis of the endothelial cells in affected vessels .
it has been suggested that the pathogenesis of the renal vascular lesions can be elained on the basis of a generalized shwartzman reaction .,"however , disseminated intravascular coagulation initiated by endotoxemia may be all that is necessary to cause these and other vascular lesions in septicemia due to gram - negative bacteria ."
there is a flooding of the alveoli by edema fluid and moderate numbers of alveolar macrophages .,this is the usual histologic picture ; the extremes are an acute fibrinous inflammation or only a few scattered parenchymal hemorrhages .
the lesions with s . typhimurium infection are mainly confined to the colon ( fig .,the pathogenesis and morphology of the enteric lesions are similar to those described for salmonella choleraesuis enteritis .
"alternatively , rectal stricture in some cases may result from ischemia due to noninfectious causes , such as rectal prolapse .","at the time of autopsy , s . typhimurium may not be isolated due to loss of the carrier state ."
"the differential diagnosis of septicemic salmonellosis includes other septicemias that occur in feeder swine , such as peracute erysipelas , haemophilus , and steptococcus infections .",it is important to differentiate salmonella choleraesuis infection from hog cholera and african swine fever .
"various serotypes have been isolated from cats , and most of these appear to cause subclinical infections .","salmonellosis may be a problem in catteries and hospitals , however , affecting animals subjected to the usual stressful conditions mentioned earlier ."
yersinia pseudotuberculosis occasionally can be isolated from small green abscesses in the mesenteric lymph nodes of asymptomatic dogs and cats .,the organism also causes pneumonia and septicemia in foals and sporadic abortions in ruminants .
bacteria that have been confirmed as campylobacter or that resemble campylobacter morphologically are found within proliferating epithelial cells .,the first is characterized by adenomatous proliferation of epithelium in the crypts of lieberkuhn in the small intestine ( especially ileum ) and in mucosal glands in large bowel .
"piglets as young as weeks of age , however , as well as adults , may have lesions of adenomatosis .",intestinal adenomatosis is associated with a syndrome that may vary from subtle subclinical disease with a mild decrease in growth rate to diarrhea and unthriftiness .
"campylobacter invades epithelium in crypts and glands , where the bacteria lie free in the apical cytoplasm and replicate .","goblet cells disappear from affected glands , and infected epithelium is transformed to a population of highly mitotic cells ."
in a proportion of cases they involve the cecum and proximal third of the spiral colon .,"in animals with the relatively mild syndrome of uncomplicated intestinal adenomatosis , lesions are always found in the terminal portion of the ileum , extending proximally from the ileocecal - colic orifice for usually less than a meter ."
caseous yellow - brown or blood - tinged necrotic mucosa may be found focally or widely in the distal ileum and proximal large intestine .,"there may be effusion of fibrin from superficial lesions , and a pseudodiphtheritic membrane or luminal fibrin cast may be present ."
"tissue in the upper ileum at the proximal margin of the zone of mucosal necrosis should be examined for adenomatosis , since in severe cases of necrotic enteritis , no remnants of abnormal mucosa may persist elsewhere .",a few islands of viable adenomatous crypts or glands may be left deep among the necrotic debris .
"the mucosa of the affected ileum usually resembles that in uncomplicated adenomatosis , and overt points of hemorrhage or ulceration are rarely appreciated grossly .","8 e ) , and the contents of the cecum and colon may contain dark , bloody digesta and feces ."
"the diagnosis of proliferative hemorrhagic enteropathy at autopsy is based on the presence in the distal ileum of gross lesions characteristic of adenomatosis , in association with massive hemorrhage from the lower small intestine .","the condition must be differentiated from hemorrhagic ulceration of the pars esophagea , mesenteric torsion , and acute swine dysentery as well as from less common causes of gastrointestinal bleeding in swine ."
they may be seen in smears of mucosal scrapings stained by the modified koster ' s acid - fast method or with specific immunofluorescent techniques .,the diagnosis of components of the intestinal adenomatosis complex is confirmed by finding campylobacter .
the role of campylobacter as a significant primary pathogen in dogs is not proven .,"mild enteritis and colitis have been described in naturally infected dogs , while in eerimentally infected gnotobiotic dogs , lesions are limited to mild mucosal colitis ."
"campylobacter jejuni and perhaps other species are thought to be primary agents causing diarrhea in cattle , but further work is needed to define their significance .",there was hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue in peyer ' s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes .
"campylobacter jejuni , in addition to causing a significant proportion of "" vibrionic "" abortions , is isolated from the intestine of sheep with diarrhea , but its causal association is unproven .","the same agent also has been isolated from the feces of a number of scouring foals , but the significance of the infection is unclear ."
"as "" vibrio coli "" it was long associated with swine dysentery but did not induce enteritis in eerimentally inoculated gnotobiotic pigs .",more recent reports of diarrhea in conventional swine inoculated orally with c . coli need confirmation .
the disease has been reported from a number of countries and probably occurs wherever swine are raised .,"swine dysentery is a highly infectious disease mainly of weaned pigs that is characterized by diarrhea , with mucus , blood , or fibrin in the feces ."
swine dysentery can be reproduced by feeding pure cultures of t . hyodysenteriae to specific pathogen - free and conventionally reared swine .,"eerimental reproduction of the disease in gnotobiotic pigs requires the presence of anaerobic bacteria indigenous to the normal colon , along with t . hyodysenteriae ."
thrombosis of capillaries and venules in the superficial areas of the mucosa in the colon and the gastric fundic mucosa ( venous infarction ) is probably due to absorption of endotoxins released by gram - negative bacteria .,"the morphologic lesion is mucosal colitis characterized by hypersecretion of mucus , and superficial erosion with hyperplasia of cells in colonic glands ."
"once established in a herd , the infection tends to remain enzootic , and although treatment can effect a rapid clinical amelioration , it is not curative , and relapses at greater or lesser intervals are the rule .","apparently infection is not followed by a substantial immunity , although individual pigs are resistant to challenge with treponema hyodysenteriae after recovery ."
"pigs that die of swine dysentery are usually gaunt with a contracted abdomen , the eyes are sunken , and there may be bluish discoloration of the abdominal skin .",incidental lesions may include pericardial serous effusion and intense congestion and infarction of the stomach .
"in response to the increased turnover of epithelial cells associated with the superficial necrosis , there is hyperplasia of cells deeper in the glands .",many crypts are dilated and contain necrotic debris ; others show marked goblet - cell hyperplasia .
large numbers of spirochetes are easily demonstrated using warthin - starry silver stain or similar stains .,they are mainly located in the areas of superficial erosion and in the lumen of crypts .
"fewer organisms are present in the intercellular spaces between superficial epithelial cells , in the lumen of crypts , and occasionally in the lamina propria .","degenerative changes in the epithelial cells are characterized by loss of microvilli , clumping of nuclear chromatin , and swelling of the mitochondria and the rough endoplasmic reticulum ."
colonic contents may be examined by phase contrast or dark field microscopy .,large numbers of the characteristic motile spirochetes are present in affected cases .
"occasionally , other members of the genus are associated with enteric disease , examples being c . sordellii and c . hotulinum in cattle and c . strasburgense in dogs .",most of the important enteric clostridial diseases occur in herbivores and are caused by one or other of the five toxigenic types of clostridium perfringens .
"there are five types of clostridium perfringens , designated a - e , which are differentiated on the basis of their production of the four major antigenic lethal etoxins .","a strain formerly classified as type f is now regarded as a subtype of type c . the major etoxins are alpha ( a ) , beta ( p ) , epsilon ( e ) , and iota ( i ) ; the relationships between the five types and the four toxins are tabulated here : eight minor toxins ( antigens ) are produced by clostridium perfringens , and it is suggested that some of these may be useful in identification of types and in division of types a , b , and c into varieties ."
"other minor toxins include mu (| , a hyaluronidase , and delta , a hemolysin .","the k toxin is a collagenase , and x a nonspecific proteinase ."
"some strains lose their ability to produce one or more of their toxins when stored or cultured , and this complicates the identifications of isolates and the assessment of their significance in disease outbreaks .",there is not always a clear distinction between the different types of clostridium perfringens .
clostridium perfringens type a is the most common of the five types and is the only one associated with the microflora of both soil and intestinal tract .,its major toxin is the a toxin and it also produces the enterotoxin .
the production of gas gangrene in wound and puerperal infections probably is a composite effect of the major and minor toxins elaborated by the organism .,"the necrotizing and hemolytic activity of the a toxin is assisted by the collagenase and hyaluronidase , which disrupt connective tissues and permit the infection to spread ."
their postulated causative association with equine colitis x is discussed elsewhere .,a very rare disease of calves and lambs characterized by acute intravascular hemolysis is also associated with type a infections .
"clostridium perfringens type b is reported from europe , south africa , and the middle east , but not from north america and australasia .","it causes i a m b dysentery , ' ' usually in lambs up to about to days of age , dysentery in calves of approximately the same age , and dysentery in foals within the first few days of life ."
discrete and then confluent ulcerations develop if the course is long enough .,"in peracute cases , there may be only a few small patches of necrosis ."
"usually the intestinal contents are bloodstained and may appear to be composed of pure blood , but in lambs that live for or days , there may be little or no staining with blood .","on the mucosal surface , they are irregular but well defined by a sharp margin and rim of intense hyperemia , and they contain a yellow necrotic deposit ; they may coalesce to form extensive areas of necrosis ."
"the spleen is normal or slightly enlarged and pulpy , owing to congestion and dissolution of its delicate reticulum .","the kidneys may be enlarged , edematous , pale , and soft from toxic degeneration ."
confirmation depends on finding large numbers of clostridia in the necrotic tissue of the ulcers and on the detection of toxins in the intestinal contents of fresh cadavers .,the organism may be isolated only from the intestine of fresh cadavers .
older calves up to weeks of age sometimes are affected .,"it appears that calves are more likely to recover , albeit slowly , than lambs ."
"the prevalence of disease varies widely between countries , and between regions and species within countries .","clostridium perfringens type c . clostridium perfringens type c has a worldwide distribution and causes disease in adult sheep and goats , feeder cattle , and lambs , calves , foals , and baby pigs ."
"death usually occurs suddenly with terminal convulsive episodes , but some animals , with infections not so peracute , stand in a straining position that probably indicates acute abdominal pain .",the disease in adult goats probably is similar in most respects to that in sheep .
lesions in other organs are those of severe toxemia and include copious pleural and pericardial transudate of gelatinous fluid and hemorrhages beneath the serous membranes of the heart .,there is congestion and sometimes gross hemorrhage of the zona reticularis of the adrenal .
"the muscles are soft , stained pink to black with blood , and emphysematous .","because of this change , "" struck "" may be confused with blackleg if postmortem examination is delayed ."
"autolysis and postmortem bloat occur rapidly , and differentiation from ruminal tympany and other clostridial diseases is necessary .",excessive straw - colored pleural and pericardial fluid and petechiation of epicardium and endocardium are present .
"the diseases caused by type c in calves , lambs , and foals are very similar and will be discussed together .","affected animals are young sucklings , which contract the disease within the first few days of life , often within the first hr if they have been confined ."
"sick calves show abdominal pain , some show diarrhea of sudden onset , and death is preceded by spasmodic convulsions .","sick lambs may shiver , show abdominal pain , abdominal distension , dysentery , and prostration and die in hr or less ."
similar lesions occur at autopsy in all species but may be less severe in lambs .,"in lambs , the intestinal changes vary from catarrhal to acute hemorrhagic enteritis with mucosal necrosis , which , like lamb dysentery , suggests strangulation ."
"ecchymoses on the serous membranes are nearly constant , and in a few cadavers all tissues , but especially the meninges and brain , are liberally sprinkled with small hemorrhages ; these are sites of bacterial embolism , a massive terminal bacteremia by clostridium perfringens occurring in such cases .","there is usually an excess of pericardial fluid , and pulmonary interstitial edema ."
the disease occurs as epizootics in affected herds and regions and may then remain enzootic .,"whole litters are affected , usually within the first week of life and often within the first hr ; the clinical course is ~ 1 day ."
"microscopically , the necrotic process extends deeply and sometimes penetrates the muscularis mucosa .",numerous typical bacilli inhabit the necrotic tissue and line up along the margin of involved villi .
"infection is acquired from the sow ' s feces , and lesions begin in the jejunum with adhesion to and necrosis of epithelium on the villus tips .","the cells are sloughed , and extension of the necrotizing process then is nonselective and involves all the structures of the villi as it extends toward the crypt ."
on other occasions these lesions are not preceded by signs of enterotoxemia .,"these include blindness , ataxia , head pressing , and posterior paresis , and the lesions of focal symmetric encephalomalacia are present in the brains of such cases ."
"there is no gastrointestinal inflammation visible at autopsy , although there is a mild microscopic enteritis .",short lengths of the small intestine are distended with gas and are pink from hyperemia .
in eerimental cases and natural cases examined immediately after death there are no specific renal lesions .,"the kidneys often are congested , and postmortem degeneration leads within a few hours to the intertubular "" hemorrhages "" characteristic of the disease ( fig ."
all of these changes are secondary to endothelial damage produced by the toxin .,"the histologic changes in enterotoxemia include , in addition to the brain lesions described above , mild degeneration and necrosis of the epithelium of the proximal convoluted tubules with edema , congestion and interstitial hemorrhage in the renal cortex , and congestion of the medulla ( these are autolytic changes but are useful diagnostically ) ; superficial desquamation in the intestine with congestion , and numerous typical bacilli in the contents ; congestion and hemorrhage of the spleen with disruption of reticulum ; subepicardial hemorrhage and degeneration in the purkinje network ; and proteinaceous edema fluid in the lungs ."
significant biochemical abnormalities that occur in enterotoxemia include hemoconcentration and hyperglycemia .,hemoconcentration is secondary to loss of fluid into tissues and cavities through injured vascular endothelium .
clostridium perfringens type e causes a rare disease that occurs in calves and rabbits .,"calves die acutely and have a congested ulcerated abomasum and hemorrhagic enteritis , which occurs segmentally along the small intestine ."
"usually a peracute hemorrhagic gastroenteritis develops , and the specific c . perfringens type is not identified ; recurrent diarrhea associated with a type a strain has also been recorded .","dogs with the peracute disease often are found dead , lying in a pool of bloody excreta ."
""" pulpy kidney "" is not solely a disease of green , lush pastures ; it also occurs on pastures of little but coarse fibrous grass , and in sheep fed pelleted feeds .",whether it is the level of nutrients or other factors in ingested pasture that predispose to the development of enterotoxemia is unclear .
cultures of clostridium perfringens type d given orally are largely destroyed in the rumen and abomasum .,the manner in which overeating leads to clostridial enterotoxemia is complex .
"the critical factor is almost certainly the presence of starch in the small intestine , providing a suitable substrate for these sac - charolytic bacteria , and they proliferate to immense numbers perhaps more than x organisms per gram of intestinal contents , and produce correspondingly large amounts of toxin .","when the rumen is provided suddenly with excessive quantities of food , or food of a different type , there is a delay before the ruminal flora can adapt ; in this period , undigested or partially digested food may escape into the intestine , and if starch is there , as it is with overeating on grain , clostridium perfringens type d is likely to take advantage of it ."
"some sheep possess e antitoxin , attesting to previous nonfatal intoxication , and they are highly resistant to the disease .","even with high intestinal concentrations of toxin , only small amounts reach the blood stream ."
probably the disease develops in the same way in the calf as in the sheep .,the virtual confinement of the disease to calves that are overfed suggests that this is the case .
this is particularly true of type c hemorrhagic enteritis in pigs .,"the diseases caused in young animals by clostridium perfringens types b and c are principally diseases of the intestine , and this suggests that the pathogenesis is more direct ."
"under these circumstances , disease spreads rapidly among the susceptible age group , as would be eected of any virulent infection .","although both "" lamb dysentery "" and "" hemorrhagic enterotoxemia "" occur in pastured animals , they are most serious in confined animals ."
""" pig b e l , "" a necrotizing jejunitis of humans in new guinea that probably is caused by the p toxin , has been causally related to consumption of heat - stable trypsin inhibitors in sweet potatoes .",naturally occurring protease inhibitors in soybeans appear to have a similar effect in guinea pigs .
"it is also a disease of the best conditioned sheep , but the place of nutritional factors in its pathogenesis , and in the pathogenesis of disease caused by type c in feedlot cattle , has not been examined .",""" struck "" in adult sheep , caused by type c , is prevalent when the grass is short in late winter or early spring ."
there is no critical concentration of toxin diagnostic for pulpy - kidney disease or other enteric clostridial diseases .,the presence of toxin in conjunction with typical lesions is considered significant .
negative results on a toxin analysis made more than hr after death do not eliminate clostridial disease as the cause of death .,gram - stained smears should be made from various levels of the intestine or from discrete mucosal lesions .
"in natural disease , continual eure to bacteria in swallowed respiratory exudate probably is an important source of infection in those animals with pneumonia .",the development of intestinal lesions appears to be dose related in that reproduction of the disease requires repeated oral infection .
"an initial neutrophilic response occurs , and erosions of the epithelium develop .","microscopically , infection seems to occur by penetration of the specialized epithelium over intestinal lymphoid follicles ."
"mycobacterium avium has been incriminated as a cause of colonic ulceration and of granulomatous enteritis in horses ; m . intracellulare has been isolated from granulomas in mesenteric lymph nodes of pigs in various countries , but enteric lesions have not been described ; the primary complex of m . bovis may include an enteric lesion ( see tuberculosis , in the respiratory system , this volume ) .",all of these infections are of minor importance compared to that caused by m . paratuberculosis in ruminants .
"each strain can infect and produce disease in cattle , sheep , and goats .",a pigmented strain that produces an intensely orange pigment in tissues and in cultures sometimes is isolated from sheep and occasionally from cattle .
young animals are more susceptible than the old to eerimental infection .,adults may become infected but are less likely to develop the disease and often recover from the infection .
"although the major lesions of johne ' s disease usually are confined to the ileum , colon , and draining lymph nodes , the infection is generalized ; organisms may be excreted in milk , semen , and urine , and intrauterine infections occur .",bovine fetuses may be infected as early as months of gestation .
"in addition , there is leakage of plasma proteins , amino acid malabsorption , and increased gut motility with decreased intestinal transit time .","it is related to the moderate villus atrophy that develops , probably as a result of the immune response in the lamina propria ."
"emaciation is progressive and ultimately fatal , but the appetite is retained , and animals remain bright until the terminal stages .","clinically affected animals are usually years of age or older , and channel island breeds and beef shorthorn cattle appear to be unusually susceptible ."
"the feces are soft , but there is usually no diarrhea , except intermittently in the terminal stages .","johne ' s disease in sheep and goats is comparable to that in cattle , occurring in adults and characterized by chronic wasting ."
lesions are usually best developed in the lower jejunum and ileum ( fig .,"the specific intestinal lesions may occur from the duodenum to the rectum , but in many animals both of these regions are unaffected ."
"the crests of the folds are often slightly reddened by congestion , and the mucosal surface is velvety , but there is no excess of mucus except in occasional sheep and goats .",the minimal recognizable gross change is a very slight fleshy or velvety thickening of the mucosa .
"the lesion in cattle is characterized by the virtual absence of necrosis , the absence of inflammatory hyperemia , and the absence of reactionary fibrosis .",orange pigmentation of the mucosa and lymph nodes may be seen in sheep infected with the pigmented strain of the organism .
"as the epithelioid cells increase in number , the other cells are proportionately reduced .","in single sections of bowel , the epithelioid cells may infiltrate diffusely from the onset , especially when the outer layers of the mucous membranes are involved , or the infiltrations may be predominantly nodular , either in the tips or the bases of the villi ."
it is usual for the organism to be demonstrable in vast numbers both intracellularly and extracellularly in the lesions when appropriately stained by acid - fast techniques .,these lesions in sheep are the only suggestion that affected animals may develop resistance or hypersensitivity comparable to that seen in tuberculosis .
"in the early stages , the subcapsular sinus is infiltrated loosely with epithelioid cells .","the infiltrations are progressive , forming follicular or diffuse areas of epithelioid and giant cells , which may ultimately replace much of the cortex ."
"various immunologic tests are more or less useful , depending on the immune status of the host and the stage of the disease .",textbooks of medicine and the bibliography should be consulted for details .
"it may be validly objected that such organisms may be merely ingested ones being passed in the feces even when they are certainly mycobacterium paratuberculosis , but nevertheless , reliance can be placed on positive smears when the animals are typically diseased and other causes of chronic diarrhea have been eliminated by appropriate means .","in fecal smear examinations , individual acid - fast organisms are ignored ( they are probably incidental saprophytes ) and significance is given only to clumps of two or more organisms of typical size ."
"most infections probably are inapparent , but the intestine may be an important portal of entry in the development of systemic infections leading to arthritis , encephalitis , pneumonia , and abortion in ruminants .","enteritis may accompany or presage these diseases , and occasionally chlamydiae cause severe enteric disease in calves ."
"chlamydiae also infect other cells , including goblet cells , enterochromaffin cells , and macrophages .",macrophages may transport chlamydiae systemically prior to destruction by the organisms they carry .
"chlamydiae are released into the gut lumen and into the lamina propria , where they infect endothelial cells of lacteals , are released , and become systemic .","following multiplication of organisms in the supranuclear region , the cells degenerate ."
gastrointestinal disease caused by chlamydiae usually is a problem of calves less than days old but may affect older calves and may produce recurrent diarrhea .,"watery diarrhea , dehydration , and death are often accompanied by lesions , though not necessarily signs , of arthritis ."
mycotic invasion of the wall of the gastrointestinal tract is a common sequel to many diseases and lesions affecting the mucosa .,"although it is generally agreed that one or more of lowered host resistance , disruption of the normal flora , or a local lesion is required for establishment of mycotic disease in the gut , it is possible that spores are carried across the mucosa in macrophages ."
"the gastrointestinal tract is probably a common portal of entry for many sporadic , disseminated zygomycoses in animals .","the presence of fungal hyphae in mesenteric lymph node granulomas of many clinically normal cattle indicates that contrary to general impressions , invasion by these agents across the intestinal mucosa does not lead invariably to systemic disease ."
"candida species are normal inhabitants of the alimentary tract of animals , existing as budding yeasts in association with mucosal surfaces .","when there are changes in the mucosae , particularly squamous mucosae , or in the mucosal flora , the yeasts may become invasive , and branching , filamentous pseudohyphae largely replace the yeast forms ."
"candida occasionally is an opportunistic invader of mucosal lesions anywhere in the alimentary tract , but other fungi are more likely to take advantage of this kind of lesion , particularly in older animals .","candidiasis is mainly a disease of keratinized epithelium in young animals , especially pigs , calves , and foals ."
"there is congestion of vessels , and a few inflammatory cells are present under the epithelium .","histologically , the epithelium is spongy and contains abundant pseudohyphae and , particularly with c . albicans infections , pockets of neutrophils and bacteria beneath the cornified layer ."
"colic and anorexia are seen and are probably related to the development of the ulcers , which may perforate , causing peritonitis .",gastroesophageal candidiasis in foals involves the squamous epithelium and is associated with ulceration adjacent to the margo plicatus .
"dissemination with hepatic , splenic , and sometimes gastrointestinal lesions develops in some dogs and probably requires a degree of host immunoincompetence .","infection can be produced by ingestion , and possibly the rare examples of disease confined to the gastrointestinal tract develop in this manner ."
"disseminated histoplasmosis is a disease predominantly of young dogs , which usually present with weight loss , generalized lymphadenopathy , and often , diarrhea with blood , and tenesmus .",intestinal histoplasmosis has been reported as part of a disseminated disease of cats and as an isolated lesion in a horse .
macrophages filled with organisms are particularly prominent in the lymphoid tissue of the gut and the mesenteric nodes .,"microscopic diagnosis of gastrointestinal histoplasmosis is not difficult , but grossly the disease must be distinguished from intestinal lymphoma and , in the colon , from colitis of other types ."
"they are ubiquitous in raw and treated sewage and in water and are found in feces , plant sap , and slime flux of trees .",prototheca species are colorless algae closely related to the blue - green alga chlorella .
"the intestine and the eye ( see the eye and ear , volume ) are the most commonly involved sites in protothecosis of dogs .","lesions caused by prototheca include cutaneous infections of cats ( see the skin and appendages , volume ) and humans , mastitis in cows , and disseminated infections in dogs ."
"in early lesions , the organisms are scattered in the lamina propria , but later they fill the lamina propria and often are packed in cords between the connective tissue of the submucosa .",characteristic of protothecosis is the mild host response to infection ; usually only a few lymphocytes and monocytes are present .
factors predisposing to the development of intestinal protothecosis are poorly understood .,"skin infections are thought to result from traumatic inoculation , and it is possible that in the alimentary tract , prototheca is an opportunistic invader of existing mucosal lesions ."
the diagnosis of disease due to gastrointestinal helminths must be made with knowledge of their pathogenic potential and the mechanisms by which it is eressed .,"parasites are much more common than the diseases they cause , and helminthiasis , the state of infection , must be differentiated clearly from helminthosis , the state of disease ."
"these worms , present in sufficient numbers , may cause subclinical disease , such as inefficient growth , or clinical disease in the form of ill thrift .","they are of generally low pathogenicity , except for rare overwhelming infections , and are not likely to cause lethal infection , except by obstruction ."
"these worms feed on the mucosa , causing bleeding , or actively suck blood .","a second group of helminths , all nematodes , causes disease exclusively or primarily by causing blood loss ."
"there may be transient "" l e a k s "" of tissue fluid and inflammatory cells through the epithelium , and microerosion of the mucosa occurs in severe cases .","crypts become hypertrophic , and cells on the mucosal surface in animals with subtotal or total villus atrophy are often attenuated ."
"in the stomach , various species of spirurids embed in the mucosa or establish in cystic spaces in the submucosa .",the fourth group causes physical trauma to the intestinal wall by burrowing into or inciting inflammatory foci in the sub - mucosa or deeper layers .
"this is usually the result of migrating larval stages of the worm , either in definitive or intermediate hosts .","larval habronema , ascarids , hookworms , and equine strongyles may cause lesions in a variety of extraintestinal sites in the definitive host ."
"a diagnosis of helminthosis should be reserved for cases where , ideally , three criteria are met : the helminth is present , and in numbers consistent with disease ; the lesions ( if any ) typically caused by the agent are identified ; and there is a syndrome compatible with the pathogenic mechanisms known to be associated with the worm .","a presumptive diagnosis only can be made if the syndrome , and preferably lesions , are present , but worms are not ."
"it is not acceptable to diagnose helminthosis only on the basis of the presence of worms , without evidence of an appropriate disease state .","nor it is an acceptable diagnosis when a syndrome such as wasting and diarrhea , or anemia , is recognized without identifying the presence of worms or their characteristic lesions ."
ostertagosis is probably the most important parasitism in grazing sheep and cattle in temperate climatic zones throughout the world .,"it causes subclinical loss in production , and clinical disease characterized by diarrhea , wasting , and in many cases , death ."
in infected glands the lining in many cases is flattened adjacent to worms ( fig .,3 f ) but is composed of tall columnar mucous cells elsewhere in the gland .
"infiltrates of lymphocytes are present between glands deep in infected mucosa within a few days after infection of sheep with ostertagia , and lymphoid follicles with germinal centers evolve in these sites .","as has been speculated earlier , under gastritis , the epithelial lesion itself may be immune mediated ."
"the pathogenic significance of associated failure to hydrolyze protein in the abomasum , and of increased numbers of bacteria in content , is unclear .","in severe cases , the abomasal content has a ph of up to or more , and a high sodium - ion concentration ."
the interaction of protein - losing gastroenteropathy and nutrition has been discussed previously .,"plasma protein loss into the gastrointestinal tract , in combination with reduced feed intake , seems largely responsible for the weight loss and hypoproteinemia that occur in clinical ostertagiosis , and for loss in productive efficiency that occurs in subclinical disease ."
"the first , type i disease , is seen in lambs or calves at pasture during or shortly following a period of high availability of infective larvae .","it is due to the direct development , from ingested larvae , of large numbers of adult worms over a relatively short period of time ."
ostertagosis must be differentiated in sheep from other gastrointestinal helminthoses ( except haemonchosis ) and from chronic coccidiosis .,"in cattle , gastrointestinal helminthosis , chronic bovine virus diarrhea , chronic salmonellosis , and in older animals , johne ' s disease , must be considered ."
haemonchus species require a period of minimum warmth and moisture for larval development on pasture .,mecistocirrus digitatus causes disease very similar to haemonchosis in cattle and sheep in southeast asia and central america .
"haemonchus , commonly called the large stomach worm or barberpole worm , is cm long .","females give the species its common name by their red color , against with the white ovaries and uterus stand out ."
"haemonchosis may present as peracute or acute disease , resulting from the maturation or intake of large numbers of larvae .",it may cause more insidious chronic disease if worm burdens are low or moderate .
they compensate by eanding erythropoiesis two - or threefold and increasing hepatic synthesis of plasma protein .,less severely affected animals may be able to withstand the anemia and hypoproteinemia for a period of time .
low - level infections may contribute to subclinical loss of production or ill thrift through chronic enteric protein and iron loss .,"they are unable adequately to compensate for the enteric iron loss , however , despite intestinal reabsorption of a proportion of the excess and they ultimately succumb some weeks later to iron - loss anemia , when iron reserves are depleted ."
"sometimes edema of dependent portions , especially the submandibular area or head in grazing animals , is observed .","in primary haemonchosis , there is no diarrhea ; this sign may be present if intercurrent infection with large numbers of other gastrointestinal helminths occurs ."
"the abomasal rugae may be edematous due to hypoproteinemia , and focal areas of hemorrhage are evident over the surface .","in animals not decomposing , the worms will be evident to the naked eye : if alive , writhing on the mucosal surface ; if dead , less obvious and free in the content ."
"in lambs , - 3000 worms is a heavy burden , while in adult sheep and goats , - 10,000 are associated with fatal infection .",burdens of less than to haemonchus worms are unlikely to cause death in animals on a good plane of nutrition but may contribute to inefficiency in production or cause ill thrift and perhaps mortality if the quality of feed declines .
"in cattle , sucking lice , infections with bunostomum , oesophagostomum radiatum , coccidiosis , and hemolytic anemias due to babesiosis , anaplasmosis , leptospirosis , and bacillary hemoglobinuria must be considered .","at some stage , all of the hemolytic anemias cause hemoglobinuria , and icterus is often present ."
"it has a direct life cycle , third - stage infective larvae entering tunnels in the epithelium of the foveolae and isthmus of gastric glands in fundic and pyloric areas .",the worms live throughout their life at least partly embedded in intraepithelial tunnels at about this level of the mucosa .
"in all hosts , however , this species alone is capable of inducing disease if present in sufficient numbers .","after a period of several weeks , mucous metaplasia and hyperplasia are seen in glands in infected areas of the mucosa ."
the gross lesions present in heavy trichostrongylus axei infections reflect the hypertrophy of glands and superficial erosion .,"in light infestations there may be no changes visible in the abomasum , other than congestion of the mucosa ."
"mucosal lesions may be confluent in heavily infected animals , and erosions and superficial ulceration may be encountered .","infection may extend into the proximal duodenum , where polypoid masses of hypertrophic glandular mucosa are occasionally observed ."
"they must be differentiated from those due to ostertagia , with which animals may be intercurrent ^ infected , in ruminants .",the typical gross lesions in the stomach are distinctive in horses .
the ova are deposited on the ends of the coat hairs .,"there are six species of the genus , the common ones being g . intestinalis , g . nasalis , and g . haemorrhoidalis , and the uncommon ones g . pecorum , g . nigricornis , and g . inermis ."
"members of any of these species may occasionally be found attached to the pharynx and esophagus , but except for g . pecorum , which congregates in the pharynx and causes pharyngitis , these preliminary migrations are uneventful for the host .","the larvae of g . nasalis first invade the gums , then pass to the stomach and settle on the pyloric mucosa and in the duodenum ."
"undoubtedly many are removed mechanically , and often some are found free in the ingesta .","severe infestations produce a dense , pockmarked appearance with chronic inflammatory thickening ."
the habronema larvae in the feces are swallowed by maggots of the appropriate intermediate host and persist through pupation and maturation of the fly .,"habronema majus mainly uses stomoxys calcitrans as its intermediate host , and the other two species use various muscid flies ."
the nodules generally produce no clinical disturbance though they have been considered to lead rarely to abscessation or perforation when secondarily infected with pyogenic bacteria .,"except for a small fistulous communication through which the ova pass , the epithelium is not defective , even though the protrusions may be cm or so in diameter ."
gastric parasitism is not of great clinical or pathologic importance in swine and is rare in pigs reared in modern total - confinement systems .,"ascaris suum , normally inhabiting the small intestine , may migrate or reflux to the stomach after death ."
the lesions produced by hyostrongylus resemble those caused by ostertagia in ruminants .,preadult and adult worms emerge onto the gastric mucosa about - 20 days after ingestion .
it seems probable that hyostrongylosis may interact with nutritional and metabolic factors in contributing to this syndrome .,"in the field , hyostrongylosis is associated mainly with the "" thin - sow syndrome . ' '"
"ingested third - stage larvae may migrate in the liver , leaving tracks of necrotic debris , which eventually heal by fibrosis .","in heavy infections , lesions associated with larval migration may be found elsewhere in the abdominal and pleural cavities ."
"nodules are up to cm in diameter , and open into the gastric lumen .",adults are found in groups of up to in nodules in the gastric submucosa .
more commonly they are attached as individuals or in small clusters to the gastric mucosa .,"ulcers may be formed , and the anterior end of the worm may be embedded in the submucosa ."
"the pathogenicity of these species is poorly defined , but is likely low .","cylicospirura is usually found in the submucosal nodules , similar to those formed by gnathostoma , while cyathospirura is usually found free in the lumen , or sometimes associated with cylicospirura in gastric nodules ."
clinical signs and gross lesions due to o . tricuspis are uncommon .,"in some parts of the world it is common , particularly in cat colonies and cats that roam ."
"gastric glands are separated by the heavy , reactive fibrous stroma in the mucosa .","heavy infection results in mucous metaplasia and hyperplasia of gastric glands , causing the surface of the stomach to be thrown into thickened , convoluted folds ."
"the prepatent period is short , and development of free - living larvae or the free - living generation is rapid .","if sanitation is poor , and large numbers of larvae derived from parasitic or free - living generations of the worm are in the substrate , infection through the skin may be considerable ."
"it is associated with diarrhea , occasionally fatal , in some animals less than to months of age .","it is claimed that skin lesions by larval penetration may permit entry of corynebacterium equi , which causes lymphadenitis ."
"the pathology , and presumably the pathogenesis of s . papillosus infection , are typical of the genus .","in suckling ruminants , or young animals artifically reared , strongyloides papillosus may cause diarrhea and , in occasional overwhelming infection , death ."
"affected dogs are wasted and dehydrated with evidence of diarrhea , perhaps blood tinged , but the intestine may only be congested or unremarkable at autopsy .","strongyloides stercoralis infections are most commonly fatal in puppies up to to months old , often from kennel environments ."
"it differs from the other species discussed above , however , being associated with the formation in the colon of submucosal nodules of proliferative glands infected by strongyloides .",strongyloides tumefaciens in cats has been associated rarely with chronic diarrhea .
"hypobiosis appears to be relatively uncommon among members of the genus trichostrongylus , and the circumstances by which it is stimulated are unclear .","when it occurs , larvae are retarded in development at the parasitic third stage ."
"the levels of brush - border enzymes , notably alkaline phosphatase , peptidases , and maltase , are diminished in affected areas of intestine .","in animals with subtotal villus atrophy , exfoliating , rounded enterocytes are seen , as are focal and probably transient "" l e a k s "" of neutrophils and tissue fluids through the epithelial surface ."
"globule leukocytes may be present in the epithelium of crypts and occasionally villi , but this is often not marked in severely affected mucosa .","in the superficial lamina propria , neutrophils often accumulate beneath the epithelium , and in areas of erosion or previous erosion , there may be a thin , transversely oriented layer of connective tissue ."
"in addition , reduced mineralization of bone may be attributable to reduced intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus ( see osteoporosis , in bones and joints , volume ) .",the pathogenesis of trichostrongylosis in calves and goats is similar to that in sheep .
"examination of the duodenal mucosa of freshly dead animals using a hand lens or dissecting microscope will reveal patchy or diffuse atrophy of villi , and fine white or translucent , threadlike worms , about - 8 mm long , entwined on the mucosal surface .","the mucosa of the duodenum in the freshly killed animal may be glistening and pink , but in spontaneous mortalities with superimposed postmortem change , it will be unremarkable ."
"the most important species are n . helvetianus , which infects cattle ; n . spathiger and tv .",nematodirus species infect the anterior third of the small intestine of ruminants .
"however , the hatch of infective larvae of nematodirus battus and n . filicollis from the egg is delayed .","eggs of n . battus deposited on the ground in one year hatch the next spring , following a period of conditioning by cold over winter ."
"larvae emerge at the fourth or fifth stage to take up residence coiled among the villi , with their posterior ends protruding toward the lumen .","third - stage larvae enter the deeper layers of the mucosa , perhaps penetrating into crypts ."
"if villus atrophy is severe , the ability of the worms to maintain their position may be compromised .","biochemical studies reveal reduction in levels of mucosal alkaline phosphatase and disaccharidases , which correlate with the severity of diarrhea in affected sheep ."
"a moder - ate mixed inflammatory response with substantial numbers of lymphocytes , plasma cells , and eosinophils is evident in the lamina propria .","the pathogenesis of the villus atrophy has not been determined , but it may be related to the development of immune responses to the presence of nematodes in the lumen ."
"though both sheep and cattle may suffer from mixed burdens of helminths containing or dominated by populations of cooperia , this genus seems to be most significant in cattle , especially in cool temperate regions .","the important species include c . curticei , mainly in sheep and goats , and c . pectinata , c . punctata , and c . oncophora , mainly in cattle ."
the associated atrophy of villi is concomitant with reductions in the brush - border enzymes .,"heavy burdens of cooperia in calves , in excess of , 000 to , 000 nematodes , may be associated with reduced weight gain , or weight loss and diarrhea ."
"the former is most common in tropical , subtropical , and warm temperate zones of africa , austrialia , asia , and north america , where adequate humidity for larval development occurs .","ancylostoma braziliense occurs in dogs and cats in the tropics and subtropics , while a . ceylanicum is found in both species in sri lanka and southeast asia ."
"members of the genus ancylostoma are capable of infecting the host by four routes : orally , with direct development to adult worms in the intestine ; by skin penetration , resulting in movement through the bloodstream to the lungs , and thence via the trachea to the pharynx and gut ; by the lactogenic transmission of third - stage larvae mobilized from dormancy in the skeletal muscle of parturient bitches ; and in occasional instances , by prenatal transplacental transmission of mobilized larvae in pregnant bitches .",the latter route of transmission does not apparently occur in a . braziliense infection .
"blood loss is maximal while worms are attaining maturity , between and days after infection , and then again during the peak period of egg production , after | weeks of infection .","bloodsucking activity begins when larvae enter the adult stage , in a . caninum days after infection ."
the amount of blood lost per worm is least in heavier infections .,"pups several months old with populations of the order of to worms may lose to % of their blood volume per day , depending on body weight ."
"heavy infections acquired by this route may result in death from anemia and hypoproteinemia within a few days of the initiation of bloodsucking activity , and before eggs are present in the feces .","acute fatal ancylostomosis occurs most commonly in pups only weeks of age , infected via the bitch ' s milk ."
"the intestinal mucosa appears thickened , and focal hemorrhages at sites of attachment may be scattered over it .",worms may be particularly distributed in the distal small bowel in heavy infections and are often embedded in the mucosa in freshly dead animals .
"haemonchosis may occur concurrently or should be eliminated as a diagnosis , as should fascioliasis , and in cattle , oesophagostomum radiatum infection .","the relatively low numbers of worms associated with disease , and their peculiar distribution , dictate that the entire gut be examined and flushed and a careful search be made for these species in suspect cases ."
"the host - parasite relationships include , in dogs , t . vulpis ; in cats , t . campanula and t . serrata ; in swine , t . suis ; in sheep and goats , t . ovis , t . globulosa , and t . skrjabini ; in cattle , t . discolor and , less commonly , t . ovis and t . globulosa .","they inhabit the cecum and , occasionally , the colon of all the domestic animals considered here , except the horse ."
"in the dog , large populations of worms overflow their normal habitat and infect the mucosa of the ascending , and often more distal , colon , sometimes extending to the rectum .","the signs are chronic diarrhea or dysentery , perhaps with some weight loss ."
some contribution of the normal anaerobe flora to the development of lesions more severe than mild catarrhal colitis is apparent .,lesions are more severe in swine with conventional gut flora than in those reared germ free or free of known enteric pathogens .
"though erythrocyte loss does occur , it is a minor component of the pathogenesis .","the signs of the disease appear to be referable to loss of colonic absorptive function , and probably partly to effusion of protein into the lumen ."
"at autopsy the lesions are those of cachexia and hypoproteinemia , associated with a mucohemorrhagic typhlitis or typhlocolitis .",affected animals develop chronic diarrhea with brown feces or dysentery and loss of condition .
"they are barrel - shaped , have a thick wall , and plugs at both poles of the egg .",capillaria worms and ova may be similar in tissue section but are not eected in the cecum and colon of domestic animals .
"considerable exudation of tissue fluids and plasma protein from colonic lesions , in addition to that due to hemorrhage , contributes to the hypoproteinemia and gastrointestinal protein loss .","reduced growth , or loss in condition , is mainly the product of the interaction between protein effusion into the gut and inappetence ."
"they incite a reaction causing local loss of the muscularis mucosae , so that the nodule formed involves both mucosa and submucosa , and the larvae ultimately reside in the submucosa .",the larvae initially lie about the level of the base of the mucosa .
"burdens of about to , 000 adult worms are associated with subclinical disease eerimentally .","occasional diarrhea , depression in weight gain , and inefficiency of feed conversion may occur , especially during the period of emergence of larvae and maturation of worms in the lumen of the large intestine ."
"grossly , the lesions are characterized by edema of all layers of the wall of infected parts of the colon , and enlargement of colonic lymph nodes .","worms are generally concentrated in the proximal portion of the spiral colon , and the area they inhabit may have numerous hemorrhagic foci corresponding to sites of former attachment ."
"returning larvae in nodules are surrounded by necrotic debris , neutrophils , some eosinophils , and perhaps some macrophages , and the adjacent arteriole may be thrombosed .","they eventually break into the lumen of the large bowel , especially cecum and right ventral colon , where they mature in another month or two , about months after infection ."
"lesions of the cranial mesenteric artery and of the cecal and colic arteries may lead to colic as a result of reduced perfusion or thromboembolism , or perhaps due to impingement on autonomic ganglia in the vicinity of the arterial root at the aorta .","the recognition and diagnosis of infarctive lesions of the equine bowel , and their sequelae , have been discussed with ischemia and infarction of the intestine ."
"here they molt to the fourth stage , and days after infection , begin migrating through the hepatic parenchyma .","third - stage larvae enter the intestinal wall and pass in the portal system to the liver , where they incite inflammatory foci ."
lesions associated with the larval migration of s . edentatus are usually incidental findings at autopsy .,"there they form nodules and hemorrhagic foci in the wall of the gut , eventually perforating to the lumen , where they mature and begin to lay eggs about - 12 months after infection ."
"eheathed third - stage larvae penetrate to the deeper layers of the wall of the cecum and colon , molt to the fourth stage , and produce hemorrhagic subserosal nodules before moving to the liver through the peritoneal cavity .",strongylus equinus is relatively less prevalent and abundant than the other two members of the genus .
"the presence of hemomelasma ilei is sometimes associated with clinical , but nonfatal , colic .","the lesion is not uncommon as an incidental finding , however , and probably is a rare cause of clinical signs ."
"the other genera in the strongylinae , triodontophorus , oesophagodontus , and craterostomum , have life cycles that probably involve local migration of developing larvae into the deeper layers of the mucosa or the submucosa in the large intestine .",here they form small nodules before emerging to mature in the lumen of the cecum and colon .
"in sufficient numbers they may cause ill thrift , and perhaps anemia , as the result of active hematophagia and blood loss from recent sites of feeding activity .","increased albumin catabolism causing accelerated turnover of the plasma pool , and reduced red cell survival , have been demonstrated in horses infested with relatively low numbers ( < 100 ) of strongylus vulgaris ."
"in the mucosa they are surrounded by a fibrous capsule , and there may be a moderate mixed inflammatory reaction containing eosinophils in the mucosa and adjacent submucosa .",a similar but more intense reaction is seen around larvae in the submucosa .
"the cecal and colic lymph nodes may be enlarged and wet , and the mesentery of the large bowel edematous .","diarrhea and wasting are presumably due to reduced absorptive function , and loss of protein is associated with the damage to the colonic mucosa caused by emerging larvae ."
infections heavy enough to cause clinical signs are rare in swine reared under conditions of good hygiene and husbandry .,"however , respiratory signs characterized by dyspnea ( commonly termed * ' thumps ' ' ) may occur in piglets if large numbers of larvae migrate through the lungs ."
"they may be present in alveoli , alveolar ducts , bronchioles , or bronchi , perhaps surrounded by eosinophils .","in more chronic cases , larvae in tissue are in eosinophilic granulomas ."
"fibrosis extends diffusely through more distant tracts , however , emphasizing lobular outlines .","there is a heavy eosinophil infiltrate in fibrotic septa , which becomes most obvious beginning about - 14 days after infection ."
"the liver is firm , and heavy scars may become confluent , obliterating some lobules and extending out to exaggerate interlobular septa throughout the liver .","where pigs are raised intensively , it is now rare to encounter extreme fibrosis of the liver associated with ascarid migration ."
hypertrophy and exhaustion of the goblet - cell population and increased prorial infiltrates of eosinophils and mast cells are also observed in infected intestine .,the presence of about to worms in - month - old swine fed low - protein rations may depress feed intake and the efficiency of feed conversion .
"in some abnormal hosts , including humans , a syndrome termed visceral larva migrans has been described , characterized by eosinophilia , general malaise , and perhaps signs related to granulomatous reactions to larvae in the eye , liver , lungs , and brain .",larvae in paratenic hosts eaten by dogs develop in the gut of the definitive host .
sometimes up to % of the body weight of young puppies may be accounted for by the worm burden .,"at autopsy , the animal appears poorly grown for its age , potbellied , and cachectic , and masses of maturing worms are present in the intestine and perhaps stomach ."
"larvae may be destroyed in such foci , which heal by scarring .","considering the large numbers of larvae that must move through the tissues of dogs , and in many cases be sequestered there , relatively few are encountered incidentally , free or encapsulated in granulomas ."
larvae free of such a response are also found in the mucosa and submucosa .,larval tocara cati developing in the mucosa of the stomach and intestine may provoke a mild granulomatous response comprising lymphocytes and a few macrophages about the coiled larva .
"heavily infected calves may die in an emaciated state , with burdens of up to to worms as much as cm long in the intestine .","signs of infection include foul diarrhea and ill thrift , and perhaps colic suggestive of impaction ."
"despite the large number that may be present , they do not appear to be pathogenic .","the worms are small , mm long , and may be present in the millions on the mucosa and in the content of the cecum and right ventral colon ."
"the male is cm long , but the female may be cm , with a narrow tail comprising up to % the body length .","they lay eggs on the perianal area , and their main significance is the irritation this activity causes ."
"adult tapeworms inhabit the gastrointestinal tract or the ducts of the liver and pancreas , where they are generally of minor pathologic significance .","they are flattened , segmented colonies of sequentially maturing hermaphroditic reproductive units , or proglottids , forming an elongate strobila a few millimeters to many meters long ."
"they are segmented , and the scolex may be encountered at the anterior end , attached to the intestine .","adult cestodes in tissue section are flattened , with internal organs in a loose , parenchymatous matrix , often containing calcareous corpuscles in the outer region and lacking tubular digestive structures ."
"stilesia globipuncta is found in the small intestine of sheep and goats in europe , asia , and africa , while s . hepatica occurs in the bile ducts of ruminants in africa and asia .","in ruminants , the more common and widely distributed intestinal tapeworms are moniezia eansa , m . benedini , and thysaniezia ( helictometra ) giardi ."
"heavy infestations of the small intestine by moniezia , thysaniezia , and avitellina may be associated with diarrhea and ill thrift in young lambs and calves .",concomitant gastrointestinal nematode parasitism may well be present and of greater significance .
"worms are often concentrated in the segmented , saclike dilations in the duct .",stilesia hepatica and thysanosoma actinioides may cause mild fibrosis and ectasia of the bile ducts .
plerocercoids develop into the adult worm in the intestine of piscivorous mammals .,"macrocytic hypochromic anemia associated with vitamin b deficiency , probably induced by competitive absorption from the gut by the worm , has been reported in some infected people ."
"mesocestoides occasionally infects dogs , as well as other mammals and some birds , in north america , europe , asia , and africa .","these members of the eucestoda have a life cycle involving an insect or mite , and a vertebrate as intermediate hosts ."
cysticercoids develop in fleas and perhaps in the dog louse trichodectes canis .,"infection in the normal definitive hosts , or in accidental ones such as humans , is by ingestion of fleas containing cysticercoids ."
"others persist to develop in the liver , while still other metacestodes pass on to the heart , lungs , and systemic circulation , establishing in muscle or a variety of other sites and tissues .","some migrate in the liver , eventually to enter the peritoneal cavity ."
"taenia taeniaeformis infects the intestine of domestic cats and some wild felids , and the strobilicercus , cysticercus fasciolaris , is found in the liver of small rodents .","the adults are up to cm long , have no neck , and posterior segments are somewhat bell - shaped , so this species is readily differentiated from the other cestodes found in the feline small intestine ."
"usually the intensity of infection is low , and a few , but occasionally scores of cysticerci , delicate , translucent , fluctuant , fluid - filled cysts up to cm or more in diameter , are contained in individual thin , noninflammatory fibrous capsules scattered on the peritoneal serosa .","cysterci trapped in the liver may persist in a fibrous capsule or be destroyed in a cystic eosinophilic granuloma , which may mineralize ; this is common on the diaphragmatic surface , where the falciform ligment is attached ."
"cysticercosis of muscle caused by c . ovis , c . bovis in cattle , and c . cellulosae in swine is considered with disease of muscle ( in muscles and tendons , volume ) .","the adult stages of the latter two cysticerci , t . saginata and t . solium , respectively , occur in the small intestine of humans ."
the larval coenurus is found in the subcutaneous and intermuscular connective tissue of lagomorphs .,"usually , large numbers of tapeworms are found in individual infected dogs , presumably due to the development of many individuals from the numerous scolices in one or more coenuri ."
"the migration of small metacestodes in the central nervous system may cause tortuous red or yellowish gray tracks in the brain due to traumatic hemorrhage and malacia , and nervous signs or death may occur at this stage .","in the goat , coenuri may also occur in other organs , beneath the skin and intramuscularly ."
"in enzootic areas the distinctive metacestodes , or hydatid cysts , are commonly found in normal or accidental intermediate hosts .","echinococcus tapeworms occur in the small intestine of a number of species of carnivores , predominantly canids ."
"oncospheres infecting other hosts either may not establish or , more commonly , develop into sterile cysts that do not produce protoscolices .",thus knowledge of the local cycles of e . granulosus permits interpretation and prediction of the patterns of fertility and sterility of cysts found in the various potential intermediate hosts .
"the scolex distends the crypt , and the epithelium is gripped by the suckers and occasionally eroded .","the worms that develop are short , usually less than to mm long ."
"less commonly , the brain , heart , and bone may be sites of development of hydatid cysts .","in sheep , they may be more common in lungs , while in cattle and horses , the liver is the usual site of establishment ."
"within this , and in close apposition , is the lamellar hyaline outer layer of the hydatid cyst wall , which with time may become hundreds of micrometers thick .","as they develop , a layer of granulation tissue , which may contain round cells and eosinophils , invests the cysts , and this evolves so that the inner portion of the fibrous capsule is composed of mature collagenous connective tissue , which is relatively acellular ."
"in section , among necrotic debris , macrophages and giant cells , remnants of the lamellar outer membrane , and perhaps the rostellar hooklets of degenerate protoscolices may be recognized , confirming the origin of the lesion .",degenerate hydatid cysts may resemble tuberculous lesions or squamous - cell carcinoma but for the fact that they can often be shelled out of the fibrous capsule .
dogs and cats may also become infected with the worms in enzootic areas .,"echinococcus multilocularis has a holarctic distribution , the adults occurring mainly in foxes , and the metacestodes in small rodents , especially voles and lemmings ."
"the flukes involved are small , less than to mm long , and must be sought carefully at autopsy .","the production of excessive intestinal mucus , and hemorrhagic enteritis , have been associated with intestinal fluke infection in small animals ."
"the microscopic changes in lymph nodes include depletion of lymphocytes , focal necrosis with neutrophilic infiltrates , and an increase in the number of histiocytes in the cortex and medulla .","similar changes may occur in the thymus , and splenic follicles may undergo necrosis ."
"if massive infection occurs , however , growth in the small intestine is retarded , and flukes may persist for months in the duodenum , prolonging the course of disease .","after about to weeks in the small intestine , the worms normally migrate forward , through the abomasum , to establish and mature in the reticulorumen ."
"there is atrophy of villi , elongation of crypts , and possibly erosion or ulceration of the mucosa in heavily infected areas .",larger immature forms are attached to the surface of the mucosa by a plug of tissue taken into the acetabulum .
fasciolopsis buski may also infect the small intestine of swine as well as humans .,it is of little importance in pigs other than as a reservoir for human infection .
"in horses in africa and india , the paramphistomes gastrodiscus aegyptiacus and pseudodiscus colinsi occur in the large bowel .","larvae of the former species have been associated with severe colitis in horses , but they are generally nonpathogenic ."
sexual development takes place in the intestinal mucosa of a predator .,"at least one generation of asexual replication , often several , occurs in the tissues of one or more species of prey ."
"in the heteroxenous isospora , tolasma , sarcocystis , hammondia , besnoitia , and frenkelia , asexual stages in the intermediate hosts may be found in a variety of tissues .","depending on the parasite and the stage of development , the range of tissues infected may be wide or narrow ."
mature developmental stages are usually readily recognized ; immature forms may not be easily identifiable .,"trophozoites , small , undifferentiated , rounded , basophilic forms with a single nucleus , within a parasitophorous vacuole in the host cell , are found at three stages of the life cycle : following invasion by the infective sporozoite , prior to merogony ; following invasion by a merozoite , prior to a subsequent generation of merogony ; following invasion by a merozoite , prior to differentiation into a recognizable gamont ."
"the contained sporont is spherical , with nucleus and nucleolus , and amylopectin granules in the cytoplasm .","the oocyst wall is composed of one or two clear or eosinophilic , refractile membranes in most species of coccidia , but the outer wall of some species can be very thick and densely amphophilic ."
"the development of coccidiosis is a function of the innate virulence of the organism , the size and viability of the inoculum , and the susceptibility of the host .","in dogs and cats , coccidiosis is a minor problem , and in horses , coccidia probably do not cause disease ."
"this contrasts with eimeria necatrix infection in chickens , where acute hemorrhage occurs around schizonts in the lamina propria .","in tolasmosis , necrosis and focal acute or chronic inflammatory reactions may be incited by actively replicating asexual stages in many organs ."
"however , even some species of coccidia developing in cells in the lamina propria , in large numbers , seem innocuous .",this may reflect relative insulation from host defense mechanisms due to their largely intraepithelial location or it may be associated with a relatively low biotic potential .
"this seems the likely elanation for outbreaks of bovine coccidiosis occurring during midwinter in freezing climates , or in postparturient stabled dairy cattle .","epizootiologic evidence suggests that under some circumstances there may be relaxation of resistance and resumption of development of the organisms , ultimately eressed in disease ."
"cryptosporidiosis and the heteroxenous cystforming organisms , including tolasma and sarcocystis , will be considered subsequently .","the members of the genera eimeria and isospora , and coccidiosis caused by them in the various species , will be considered further here ."
"the first - generation schizont of e . bovis infects hypertrophic endothelial cells in lacteals on the upper part of villi in the lower small intestine , several meters proximal to the ileocecal valve .","these schizonts may be large , up to | xm in diameter , and are visible to the naked eye as pinpoint white nodular foci in the mucosa ."
"hence , they are not so readily visible grossly as those of e . bovis .","they are most common in the terminal meter of the ileum , however , and are located in the lamina propria below the crypt - villus junction , often deep near the muscularis mucosae rather than in the endothelium of the lacteal ."
cells infected by eimeria bovis tend to dissociate and project into the lumen of the gland .,"where infected epithelium remains more or less intact , the surface does not erode , and effusion of exudate is not apparent ."
"if destruction is widespread , and the animal survives sufficiently long , the mucosa may ulcerate to the level of the muscularis mucosae and begin to granulate .","in areas where the lesion is patchy , glands that have been relatively spared may become lined with hyperplastic epithelium , making an attempt to regenerate the mucosa ."
"the nervous signs in bovine coccidiosis are not associated with recognized lesions in the brain , and their cause remains unknown .","malabsorption due to mucosal damage in the cecum and colon , and inflammatory effusion and hemorrhage , elain the enteric signs of coccidiosis ."
coccidiosis can often be simply confirmed at autopsy by finding developing stages in mucosal scrapings .,"the gross lesions of coccidiosis in cattle must be differentiated from those in salmonellosis , bovine virus diarrhea , rinderpest , malignant catarrhal fever , and bovine adenovirus infection , all of which may cause typhlocolitis ."
"eimeria alabamensis develops in vacuoles within the nucleus of epithelial cells in small intestine and , in heavy infections , the large bowel .","oocysts of this species are large , about x | xm and thick walled , with a micropyle , and have been found in the lamina propria ."
"former assumptions on the potential for cross - infection of coccidia between sheep and goats , and of the species found in each host , have been revised considerably as new tanomic and biologic information has come to light .",consideration of the etiology of coccidiosis in these species is complicated by the morphologic similarity of the coccidia infecting sheep and goats .
"eimeria ninakohlyakimovae , e . arloingi , e . christenseni , e . caprovina , and e . caprina occur in goats ; e . ahsata , e . ovinoidalis ( formerly e . ninakohlyakimovae ) , e . ovina ( formerly e . arloingi "" a "" ) , e . weybridgensis ( formerly / ? , arloingi "" b "" ) , a n d e .","of these , seven ( eimeria crandallis , e . faurei , e . granulosa , e . intricata , e . pallida , e . parva , and e . punctata ) are recognized in both sheep and goats , and among these further tanomic revision is eected ."
"in young , suckled animals and those in feedlots , eed to large numbers of oocysts , signs may occur before oocysts are passed .","weaned lambs , presumably eed to only light infections while at range , are also prone to coccidiosis when brought into feedlots ."
"outbreaks of coccidiosis in confined lambs and kids are usually acute and characterized by moderate morbidity and low mortality ; there is green or yellow , watery diarrhea , occasionally with blood or mucus .",yarded and grazing animals may also suffer weight loss or subclinical ill thrift .
"neutrophils and macrophages may accumulate in response to merozoites released from ruptured giant schizonts , but the most significant microscopic lesions are those in the cecum and colon , which resemble those in cattle due to e . bovis and e . zuernii .","in sections , schizonts and gamonts are in many or most cells lining glands in affected areas ."
eimeria christenseni and e . arloingi in goats and e . ahsata and e . ovina in sheep are also associated with serious disease .,"they seem to have somewhat similar developmental cycles and lesions , though interpretation of the literature is clouded by confusion among these species ."
these foci are areas of intense infection of cryptal and villus epithelium by gamonts and developing oocysts .,"there may be some hemorrhage into the intestine , but the feces are rarely bloody ."
"first - generation schizonts are most numerous in the lacteals of villi in the lower jejunum , gamonts are mainly above the host - cell nucleus , and the associated , grossly visible plaques in the mucosa ( fig .",". 4 8 a , b ) may tend to be more distal in the small intestine , and occasionally involve the large bowel ; e . ahsata and e . ovina in sheep are similar ."
why nodular masses of infected cells apparently persist in chronically infected animals without clinical disease is unclear .,this may aid a histologic diagnosis in otherwise autolytic gut in clinical cases .
"development in such locales is to be regarded as not uncommon , but aberrant , and likely dead - end .",these stages probably result from establishment of sporozoites or primary merozoites swept from the lacteal into the lymphatic drainage early in infection .
"eimeria weybridgensis ( e . arloingi "" b "" ) , which infects most of the length of the small intestine , may contribute also .","under some circumstances , several of these species cause villus atrophy in infected areas of intestine ."
"oocyst numbers are usually high in feces , but this is neither constant in , nor necessarily indicative of , coccidiosis .","mucosal scrapings or tissue sections of mucosa containing large numbers of asexual and gametogenous coccidial forms , in association with diarrhea , and perhaps some hemorrhage into the intestine , support the diagnosis in the absence of other syndromes such as gastrointestinal helminthosis ."
"the only coccidium of horses reported with any frequency is eimeria leuckarti , which is found in horses and donkeys the world over .","in one survey of foals in the united states , it was found in nearly %."
"the macrogametes have distinctive large eosinophilic or pas - positive granules , which may be individual or confluent .","the host cells are markedly hypertrophic with a fibrillar periphery , and the enlarged nucleus forms a crescent along one side of the parasitophorous vacuole ."
"piglets usually become infected within the first day or two of life , perhaps by coprophagy of the sow ' s feces .","isospora suis replicates in the epithelium on the distal third of villi , mainly in the jejunum and ileum , though infected cells may be found in the duodenum and colon in a few animals ."
"this relates partly to the lower rate of replication of epithelium in the crypts of young piglets , and therefore , the development of more severe villus atrophy .",the severity of lesions and signs is much greater in piglets a few days old in comparison with those weeks of age .
coccidial stages may be difficult to find in animals that have been ill for several days .,"oocysts may not be found in feces , either because the infection is not yet patent , the patent period has passed , or the lesions are very severe , reducing the number of oocysts produced ."
rotavirus and coronavirus also cause villus atrophy and are the main conditions to differentiate from coccidiosis in animals with atrophic villi .,"when they occur together with coccidiosis , they may have additive effects ."
rare massive infections of some other species may also cause disease .,"the species considered potentially pathogenic include e . debliecki , e . scabra , and e . spinosa ."
"atrophy of villi or erosion and local hemorrhage may be evident , the lamina propria is edematous , and desquamated epithelium and oocysts are in the lumen of the gut .","large numbers of schizonts , gamonts , and developing oocysts are in epithelial cells on villi and sometimes in crypts ."
"although several species of eimeria have been reported from dogs and cats , their status as genuine parasites of these hosts is in doubt .","the significant coccidia of dogs and cats are members of the genus isospora , considered here , and tolasma , sarcocystis , hammondia , and besnoitia , dealt with subsequently ."
"the lesions of coccidiosis in small animals are poorly defined , and care must be taken not to ascribe disease to these organisms simply on the basis of the presence of endogenous stages in the mucosa of animals dead of enteric disease .","coccidiosis in the dog and cat is largely a clinical entity , usually nonfatal ."
"these intermediate hosts are infected by oocysts shed in the feces of cats , or perhaps by a variety of other routes considered below .",five stages of asexual development have been recognized in the intestinal epithelium of cats infected with tissue cysts from intermediate hosts .
"eventually , tachyzoites enter host cells , induce the formation of a cyst wall , and divide slowly by endodyogeny , forming bradyzoites .",rapidly dividing forms ( tachyzoites ) may proliferate in many sites for an indefinite number of generations and are the stage associated with acute tolasmosis in cats and other species .
tolasma gondii is unique among the protozoa in its ability to parasitize a wide range of hosts and tissues .,"it is one of the most ubiquitous of organisms ; eerimentally , essentially all homeothermic animals can be infected , and natural infections have been shown to occur in nonhuman primates , rodents , insectivores , herbivores , and carnivores , including domestic species and humans ."
transplacental infection occurs commonly in sheep and goats and sporadically in swine and humans .,carnivorous animals and humans may become infected by ingesting cysts containing bradyzoites in tissues of infected animals .
the ability of tolasma to survive in the intracellular environment is apparently due to failure of fusion of lysosomal membranes with membranes of the parasitophorous vacuole .,the reasons for this failure of phagocytic degradation of tolasma are still poorly understood .
"cyst formation may take place as early as to weeks after infection , and they may persist for months , possibly years .",the formation of cysts is accompanied by the disappearance of tachyzoites from the circulation and visceral organs .
the cysts rupture and cause a severe inflammation that is mainly hypersensitive in character .,"when the level of immunity drops below a critical level , for example , due to treatment with immunosuppressive drugs , intercurrent disease , or other factors that depress immunity , a chronic infection may become reactivated ."
systemic tolasmosis has been reported in most species of domestic animals .,"pulmonary lesions are probably most consistently found , followed by central nervous system lesions ."
"these lesions are soon followed by regenerative changes characterized by hyperplasia and hypertrophy of alveolar lining cells , mainly type ii pneumocytes : so - called epithelialization of alveoli .","foci of necrosis involving the alveolar septa , bronchiolar epithelial cells , and blood vessels are scattered throughout the lobules ."
"if the pancreas is involved , there is extensive peripancreatic fat necrosis , with areas of coagulation necrosis in parenchyma .",numerous tachyzoites are usually evident in both ductal and acinar cells .
there may bq necrosis and depletion of lymphocytes in the follicles .,a moderate inflammatory reaction may be evident at the periphery of the necrotic areas .
"in the heart and skeletal muscle , foci of necrosis and mononuclear - cell inflammation may be part of tolasmosis .","there is often some difficulty in distinguishing between tachyzoites and mineralization of mitochondria in myocytes , but at some distance from areas of acute reaction , inert cysts can usually be identified in healthy fibers ."
"with the exception of the dormant cysts , which may be found in brain , the accidental discovery of tolasma in routine sections is rare .","the inference from this is that in spite of the ubiquity of the infection , when tolasma is found in sections in association with lesions , it is probably significant ."

"in eerimental murine giardiasis , infection is associated with hypertrophy of crypts and increased production of cells , combined with an increased rate of movement of enterocytes along villi .","marked histologic abnormality is not found in many cases of giardiasis in humans , and this seems also to be true for dogs and cats ."
"bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine may occur with giardia infection , however , and associated bile salt deconjugation could elain steatorrhea in giardiasis .","giardia may also inhibit the activity of pancreatic lipase , causing fat malabsorption ."

the association of trichomonads with diarrhea in horses is discussed briefly with typhlocolitis in horses .,"trichomonas , or similar flagellates , are sometimes encountered in the feces of horses , dogs , cats , and cattle with diarrhea , but there is no established causal association between the organisms and disease ."

these high survival rates were associated with the inhibition of viral migration and replication in brains of the mice ( fig .,) prevented the death of all mice infected by orov or grov ( table ) .
"in vivo eeriments confirmed the antiviral activity of ifn - on orov and grov , but not on carv , gmav and tcmv , being that this antiviral activity was dependent on the administration period of the drug ( tables and ) .",the antiviral effect of ifn - observed in vivo was related to its ability to inhibit viral replication in the brain tissue of infected mice .
"additionally , a recent study has demonstrated that the nss protein is also able to inhibit the ifn response through the interaction with the me component of mediator , a protein complex necessary for mrna production ( l onard et al . , ) .","this protein showed to be able to block the production of ifn / through the inhibition of transcription factors ( bouloy et al . , ; weber et al . , ) ."

"however , ifn - presented in vitro and in vivo prophylactic antiviral activities on orov and grov and also showed therapeutic antiviral action on grov .","thus , ifn - a could be potentially useful in the prevention of diseases caused by oropouche virus and in the prevention and / or treatment of diseases caused by guaroa virus , mainly during epidemics or after occurrence of a laboratory accident ."
"methods between january and march , nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from intensive care unit ( icu ) patients and medical personnel at different time - points and tested for respiratory viruses by single real - time pcr using taqman or mgb probes .","results among the icu patients tested , there were virus - positive respiratory specimens ( 30 / 173 , %) and patients who tested positive at least once for respiratory viruses ( 23 / 55 , %) ."
there is growing evidence that documents the presence of viruses in respiratory samples of critically ill patients .,"respiratory viruses are the leading cause of upper respiratory tract infections , have an important role in the etiology of community - acquired pneumonia in children and adults , and are also a major cause of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) / asthma , resulting in frequent hospitalizations ."
data on the incidence of influenza - like illness in the community of ljubljana region were obtained from the slovenian sentinel network .,"all study participants were evaluated at different time - points during the study period , namely , on each monday and thursday for consecutive weeks between january and march ."
nasopharyngeal swabs and plasma specimens were collected from all participants at each of the predetermined study time - points for the detection of selected respiratory viruses .,"at enrollment and at each study time - point , information on whether the patient had had a lower respiratory tract infection ( pneumonia , copd / asthma exacerbation ) was obtained ."
"nasopharyngeal samples were collected using flocked - tip swabs which , following use , were submerged into a vial containing viral transport media and processed immediately .","automatic nucleic acid extraction was carried out using the total nucleic acid isolation kit on a magna pure compact instrument ( roche applied science , mannheim , germany ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions ."
follow - up time was calculated as the number of days between the first and last available nasopharyngeal swab .,the primary outcome measure was test positivity to any respiratory virus among those tested at a given time - point ; multiple test positivity measurements were available for all the employees and for most patients .
"to take into account the multiple measurements repeated in each subject , analyses were adjusted for a subject variable as a random effect .",restricted cubic splines ( rcs ) were used to flexibly model the relationship between calendar time and outcome .
"as such , the outcome was the presence of acute respiratory symptoms , and the covariates were age , sex , flu vaccination , presence of sick contacts at home , and virus positivity .","we assessed which variables were associated with the presence of acute respiratory symptoms for employees using a logistic regression model , as described for the primary outcome ."
"for all analyses , differences were considered significant at p values b0 . 05 .","the p values of all statistical tests were two - sided , and % confidence intervals ( 95% ci ) were reported ."
nine patients were not included in the study because their stay in the icu was considered to be too short .,"the main reason for admission to icu was respiratory failure , and of the patients were intubated at or shortly after admission ."
patients admitted to the icu because of sepsis had the highest probability of testing positive .,only time from admission to icu was statistically significantly associated with the probability of testing positive for respiratory viruses : this probability decreased as the length of icu stay increased ( p \ 01 ) .
"of the virus - negative patients , ten ( 31.3% ) died ; in none of these patients was lower respiratory tract infection the leading cause of death .",clinical outcome according to the respiratory swab result is depicted in electronic supplementary material ( esm ) table .
"of collected respiratory specimens , ( 6.5% ) tested positive for respiratory viruses .",the baseline characteristics of the employees are shown in table .
"men were more likely to have had acute respiratory symptoms than women [ odds ratio ( or ) 5 , % ci 8-5.09 , p = 18 ] , as were employees with sick contacts at home ( or 1 , % ci 3-7.49 , p \ 01 ) .","virus - positive employees were more likely to have had acute respiratory symptoms ( or 1 , % ci 7-5.70 , p = 6 ) ; however , this association was not statistically significant ."
comparison between patients and employees revealed that patients had significantly higher probability of having a positive swab result compared to employees ( table ) .,different viruses were present in the two groups ( table ) .
"in various prospective studies using molecular methods for viral detection , respiratory viruses were observed in % of patients admitted to icu for cardiorespiratory failure , in % of patients with copd exacerbations , and in % of adult patients at the time of intubation , regardless of the reason for admission to icu .","although the majority of our patients were hospitalized in the icu due to an infectious cause , the frequency of virus - positive respiratory specimens among our patient cohort ( which varied from to % over the study period , median %, iqr - 27.1% ; ( fig ."
"in our study , the detection of respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal swabs was not always associated with a lower respiratory tract infection , as demonstrated by the only of ( 35.48% , % ci 3 - 54.62% ) virus - positive patients without lower respiratory tract infection .",the clinical relevance of respiratory virus - positive specimens by pcr needs to be appraised .
"these warm - blooded vertebrates display high species biodiversity , roosting and migratory behavior , and a unique adaptive immune system , which are favorable characteristics for asymptomatic shedding , dissemination , and mixing of different viruses for the generation of novel mutant , recombinant , or reassortant rna viruses .","as exemplified by coronaviruses and influenza viruses , bats and birds are natural reservoirs for providing viral genes during evolution of new virus species and viruses for interspecies transmission ."
these results are likely underestimations because they could not account for additional sequence diversity from undiscovered viruses .,"nonetheless , the present estimates roughly coincide with the dispersal of the human population around the world about - 100 years ago and greatly increased in the last years during the first historic transition ."
"this finding sparked intense hunting for novel covs in humans and different animal species , especially in bats .","the latest emerging novel human cov , originally named human coronavirus emc / 2012 and later renamed middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) , which has caused deaths among cases in the middle east , europe , and africa , is also phylogenetically closely related to the tylonycteris bat cov hku4 ( ty - batcov - hku4 ) and pipistrellus bat cov hku5 ( pi - batcov - hku5 ) discovered in bats in hong kong ( _06_05 / en / index . html ) ."
"bats as natural reservoirs for emerging viruses a number of unique ecological , biological , immunological , and genetic features make bats a favorable animal reservoir for the emergence of novel viruses .","bats have remarkable species diversity , with over species ( 20% of the nearly known species within mammalia and only first historical transi on : agriculture and animal herding ( 5000 - 10000 years ago ) mers"
bats may also transmit viruses to human and other animals via bites and scratches as in the case of rabies .,eures to infected urine and aerosols generated during defecation have been suggested as possible routes of intraspecies and interspecies transmission of viruses from bats .
"similar to other mammalian species , some bats possess the two major families of virus - sensing prrs , namely the toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) , which are membrane - bound prrs that detect single - stranded rna ( ssrna ) or double - stranded rna ( dsrna ) , and retinoic acid inducible gene i ( rig - i ) - like helicases ( rlhs ) , which are cytosolic prrs that detect dsrna .",bat tlrs have been described in many fruit bat species and are highly similar to other mammalian tlrs .
"importantly , bats may clear viral infection even in the absence of neutralizing antibody by other unknown mechanisms .","in adverse environmental situations such as prolonged eure to low temperature at c simulating the state of hibernation , bats may temporarily fail to mount an antibody response but resume this ability week after transferring to c ."
additional surveillance is necessary to understand the ecology of influenza viruses in bats .,the n10 is also structurally distinct with no enzymatic activity .
asymptomatic infections in ducks and geese often preceded devastating outbreaks in chickens .,"despite frequent infections , waterfowl usually remain asymptomatic even when infected by avian influenza viruses highly pathogenic in chicken ."
"the predominant antibody response in infected ducks is the truncated form of igy , which lacks the fc region and does not exhibit hemagglutination inhibition , complement fixation , opsonization , and antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity .",iga is not produced until ducks are weeks old and is eressed late after an infection .
"the first two human covs , hcov - 2 2 9 e and hcov - oc43 , primarily caused self - limiting upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold .","before the discovery of sars - cov , covs were considered as causative agents of respiratory tract infections , gastroenteritis , hepatitis , and encephalomyelitis in birds and mammals ."
"nevertheless , both models support the crucial role of bats in these interspecies transmission events .",this key finding of bats and other mammals as the natural and amplifying hosts of sars - cov led to the closure of most wildlife markets in south china followed by subsidence of the epidemic .
"it is likely that many more covs could be discovered in bats , birds , and other animal hosts such as rodents , bovines , canines , felines , swine , and equines .",bats and birds provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission .
"first , their unusually high estimated mutation rate associated with rna replication of nearly is exceptional even among rna viruses .","besides the importance of abundant animal reservoirs as gene sources and favorable environmental conditions , three major viral factors are instrumental in allowing covs to cross species barriers ."
"direct transmission of avian influenza viruses from birds and poultry to humans have been documented for h5n1 , h7n2 , h7n3 , h7n7 , h7n9 , h9n2 , h10n7 .",swine influenza viruses including the swine - origin influenza h3n2 [ ( h3n2 ) v ] and triple reassortant swine h1n1 have been transmitted directly from pigs to humans .
"the increased pathogenicity in humans can be elained by the enhanced affinity of these viruses to the a2 , 3 - sa that lines the non - ciliated cuboidal bronchiolar cells and alveolar type ii cells in human .","the d222g mutation of the a ( h1n1 ) pdm09 virus , which causes more severe disease , is associated with an increased affinity for a2 , 3 - sa without loss of affinity for a2 , 6 - sa ."
"for example , a seal influenza a virus h7n7 adapted and became pathogenic in chickens after acquiring basic amino acids at the ha cleavage site .",another potential limiting factor for interspecies transmission may be the specificity of host proteases required for proteolytic cleavage of ha0 into ha1 and ha2 .
the recent discovery of a unique influenza virus in bats may open up a new dimension in the genesis of influenza virus beyond birds while many more covs remain to be discovered in bats and birds .,these flying vertebrates are the reservoir of many viral families from which pathogenic human and mammalian viruses are derived .
we identified two additional de novo heterozygous missense variations of oas1 in two unrelated simplex individuals also manifesting infantile - onset pap with hypogammaglobulinemia .,"pap in the two simplex individuals resolved after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation , indicating that oas1 dysfunction is associated with impaired surfactant catabolism due to the defects in ams ."

this amino acid is located between the metal binding sites ( asp75 and asp77 ) in the ntp_transf_2 domain ( figure d ) and is evolutionarily conserved from opossum to human ( figure e ) .,"this variant was not registered in the esp5400 , eme aggregation consortium , or human genetic variation database and was predicted to be ' ' tolerated ' ' by sift and ' ' polymorphism ' ' by mutationtaster , but ' ' probably damaging ' ' by polyphen - 2 ( see web resources ) ( table ) ."
"another variation of c . 5 9 2 c > g ( p . leu198val ) in oas1 ( observed in c - ii - 1 but not in her parents ) ( figure c ) was predicted as ' ' tolerated ' ' by sift , ' ' benign ' ' by polyphen - 2 , and ' ' polymorphism ' ' by mutationtaster ( table ) .","neither p . cys109tyr nor p . leu198val are included in esp5400 , eme aggregation consortium , or human genetic variation database ."
"the side chain of ala76 is involved in a hydrophobic core that would define the active site structure in the rna - bound form , indicating that the p . ala76val variant would affect enzymatic activity .","ala76 in hoas1 ( ala75 in poas1 ) adjoins the two active site aspartic acid residues , asp75 and asp77 ( asp74 and asp76 in poas1 ) , which bind to mg ions ."
fol predicted only a small impact of p . ala76val and p . leu198val on protein folding ( figure b ) .,this result suggested that p . cys109tyr likely disrupts the hydrophobic core of the apo form and the importance of this residue for regulation of enzymatic activity by dsrna .
"although the functions of oas1 on ams have not been fully elucidated , eression of oas1 in ams could be induced by oxidative stress .","a single - nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) , rs10774671 , causing oas1 splicing variant p46 but not p48 and p52 , is associated with increased susceptibility to plasma leakage and shock in individuals infected with dengue virus - 2 , indicating that immune overreaction could be triggered by the specific oas1 genotype , at least in dengue virus infection ."
"there are a number of possible characteristic features of this disease , including infantile onset .",all affected individuals were term infants and had no respiratory symptoms at birth .
hypogammaglobulinemia observed in affected individuals may be due to impaired b cell function by an as yet unknown mechanism caused by heterozygous oas1 mutations .,"although the level of endogenous igg was unknown due to repeated intravenous immunoglobulin ( ivig ) administration , serum igm and iga levels increased gradually during the course of the disease ."
b - ii - 1 died from renal failure due to glomerulosclerosis following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( hsct ) .,"glomerular diseases , including glomerulosclerosis , are increasingly observed especially in individuals with graft versus host disease after hsct ."
"on the other hand , hsct is effective for gpap caused by mutations in genes that could be responsible for surfactant catabolism in ams .",lung transplantation is a curative treatment for gpap caused by mutations in genes encoding surfactant proteins or genes encoding a surfactant phospholipid transporter in alveolar type ii epithelial cells .

"approximately , 000 asthma - related deaths are reported yearly , many of which are avoidable ( christiansen and zuraw , ) .","asthma is a chronic disease , currently affecting more than million people worldwide and anticipated to increase to million by ."
microbial communities of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are essential in maintaining human health .,"given the huge number of different microorganisms that colonize the human body , their intimate contact with human cells and their multiple influences on the host , the human microbiome is no longer considered inert ."
microbial dysbiosis within the lungs and gut in asthma can be caused by many factors related to lifestyle and environmental eures .,"imbalance between the symbiotic and pathological bacterial strains in the gut and lung may lead to altered immune development and inappropriate inflammatory responses , but it is still unclear whether the imbalance is the cause or effect of disease ."
"currently , the best understanding of these complex endotypes as mechanistic pathogenetic processes lays in their dualistic division as type or non - type asthma ( agache and akdis , ) ( figure a ) .","however , often endotypes can co - exist and / or include other mixed processes , which cannot be easily categorized ( kuo et al . , ; agache and akdis , ; cos o et al . , ) ."
"these patients are usually allergic to common aeroallergens , have high blood eosinophilia , increased periostin , and high exhaled nitric oxide .","type asthma is usually observed in the clinic as earlyonset allergic asthma , late - onset eosinophilic asthma , or exercise - induced asthma ( fahy , ) ."

"this dogma significantly delayed the initiation of studies on the lung microbiota relative to the gut microbiota ( dickson et al . , ; moffatt and cookson , ) and likely persisted for several reasons : healthy lungs were often not examined by invasive bronchoscopy techniques due to ethical concerns ;","yet , even upon initiation of the human microbiome project in ( turnbaugh et al . , ) , lungs were not sampled , partially due to the existing dogma at the time that lungs are sterile ."
"however , a pioneer publication using culture - independent s rrna sequencing revealed differences in the microbial communities found in various locations of the healthy respiratory tract relative to those found in the respiratory tract of patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) ( hilty et al . , ) .",culture - based techniques were limited to known pathogens ; and bronchoscopy techniques were suspected to carry contamination from the oropharynx or nasal cavity .
"the composition of the lung microbiome in each site is thus a consequence of the balance reached between migration to the airways , elimination from the airway , site - specific immune processes ( e . g . , presence or absence of inflammation ) and the growth rates of the microbes .","the movement of air and particles , including microbiota , in the respiratory system is bidirectional ."
"detection frequency of these viruses in many studies is not different in the urt of asymptomatic controls and children hospitalized due to the respiratory tract infections , in contrast to respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) , human metapneumovirus ( hmpv ) , parainfluenza viruses ( pivs ) , and influenza , being causally associated with hospitalizations , lower respiratory symptoms , and pneumonia ( singleton et al . , ; sarna et al . , ; bhuiyan et al . , ) .","human rhinovirus ( rv ) , bocavirus , adenovirus , coronavirus , polymavirus , and anneloviridae family viruses have been identified in the urt of large proportions of healthy asymptomatic children using pcr - based methods and metagenomics , even in geographically isolated locations ( van den bergh et al . , ; bogaert et al . , ; wylie et al . , ; altan et al . , ) ."
"the virome of the healthy lungs contains members of the anelloviridae family and a high frequency of various bacteriophages ( abbas et al . , ; willner et al . , ; jankauskait _ e et al . , ) , but their abundance is greater in the context of immunosuppression and / or chronic disease ( freer et al . , ) , suggesting that immunocompetence is a prerequisite to the low abundance and biodiversity of lrt virome .","in the healthy lungs of the lrt , there are six dominant bacterial phyla : firmicutes ( including genera streptococcus and veillonella ) , bacteroides ( including genus prevotella ) , proteobacteria , fusobacteria , acidobacteria , and actinobacteria ( including tropheryma whipplei ) ( segal et al . , ; dickson et al . , dickson et al . , , ."
"however , sequencing allows identification of more diverse microbes and is not limited by the viability or ability to grow the microorganisms in vitro .",most studies underscore that the healthy microbiome is rather transient in the lungs at steady state .
the healthy microbiome of the urt and lrt plays several important roles in the development and maintenance of homeostasis of the rt and whole organism .,"the composition of the microbiome at all mucosal sites changes dynamically from the first days of life , shaping the establishment of proper interactions between the microbiota and human body and constituting the critical ' ' window of opportunity ' ' for determining future health or disease ( pattaroni et al . , ; pammi et al . , ; stiemsma and turvey , ) ."
"bacteria within the gut confer several functions to the host , including vitamin production , absorption of ions , protection against pathogens , histological development , enhanced immune functions , and fermentation of food ( hillman et al . , ) .","indeed , the human gut is inhabited by between thousand and billion bacteria per ml of luminal content depending on the region and therefore is the most densely colonized organ ( sender et al . , ) ."
"the main immunological functions of galt and ibalt include production and secretion of iga at mucosal surfaces , as well as th cell and cytotoxic ( tc ) responses ( cesta , ) .","inducible bronchus - associated lymphoid tissue ( ibalt ) and gut - associated lymphoid tissue ( galt ) , which are part of the mucosalassociated lymphoid tissue , are related in morphology and function , which includes the regulation of local immune responses ( elmore , ) ."
the concept of the gut - lung connection was born out of the observation that different lung diseases can be influenced by intestinal microenvironment changes and vice versa .,"the microbiota is an important factor responsible for interactions between these two sites in asthma ( marsland et al . , ) ."
short - chain fatty acids ( scfas ) derived from gut bacteria have inhibitory effects on proinflammatory responses in the lungs .,"one of the proposed mechanisms is that the liver can dampen the innate immune response by scfas binding to g - protein receptors or inhibiting the mevalonate pathway through hmgcoa reductase ( young et al . , ) ."
"finally , among neonates from the united states grouped into three clusters according to the composition of the gut microbiota , those with the lowest relative abundance of bifidobacteria , akkermansia , and faecalibacterium genera and a higher relative abundance of candida and rhodotorula fungi have the highest risk of developing atopy and asthma ( fujimura et al . , ) ( figure ) .","in another human birth cohort study , ecuadorian children with an increase in the relative abundance of streptococcus and bacteroides species and decrease in bifidobacterium species and ruminococcus gnavus in fecal samples at months of age have a higher risk of developing atopy and wheeze at age years ( arrieta et al . , ) ."
"scfas have also been shown to reduce inflammation in both ova and house dust mite ( hdm ) - induced airway inflammation models cait et al . , ) .","moreover , oral application of scfas to mice during pregnancy and weaning have protect offspring from allergic lung inflammation , with butyrate in particular potently inducing tregs in the lungs of offspring ( roduit et al . , ) ( figure ) ."
the metabolites secreted by lung and gut bacteria might prove useful for additional therapeutic approaches .,"conversely , intra - abdominal treatment of mice with , 13 - dihome decreased the number of treg cells in the lungs and increased pulmonary inflammation in a cockroach antigen mouse model of airway inflammation ( levan et al . , ) ( figure ) ."
"in the lungs , proteobacteria appear repeatedly to be the most dominant phylum overrepresented in patients with asthma compared with non - asthmatic volunteers across several human studies ( huang et al . , ; marri et al . , ; zhang et al . , ; hilty et al . , ) .","the proteobacteria phylum is represented by potentially pathogenic bacteria , including those that belong to the genera haemophilus , moraxella , and neisseria ( huang et al . , ; caverly et al . , ) ."
"actinobacteria , for instance , was associated with molecular evidence of response to steroids ( fkbp5 eression ) ( huang et al . , ) .","indicating the complexities of identifying cause - and - effect relationships , changes to microbial communities in the lungs may also result from asthma therapies ."
"on the other hand , a study in mild asthmatics not treated with icss has demonstrated a unique enrichment in members of the haemophilus , neisseria , fusobacterium , and porphyromonas species and the sphingomonodaceae family with concurrent depletion in members of the mogibacteriaceae family and lactobacillales in their airways ( durack et al . , ) .","together these studies suggest that the lung microbiome composition in patients with asthma , who are often treated with corticosteroids , is probably a result of complex interactions between the inflammatory milieu and the drug effects ."
"moreover , neutralization of il - 17 or tnf - a , but not il - 6 , results in accelerated clearance of m . catarrhalis and effectively prevent infection - induced exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation ( alnahas et al . , ) .","infection of mice with moraxella catarrhalis ( m . catarrhalis , proteobacterium phyla ) results in neutrophilic infiltrates , high concentrations of il - 6 , il - 1 b , and tumor necrosis factor a ( tnf - a ) , and moderate concentration of cd4 + t cell - derived ifn - g and il - 17 in the lungs day after infection ."
"in addition , the immunological and molecular mechanisms of already established dysbiosis in adult asthma need to be characterized in more detail , ideally to reverse these processes .","even if some immunological mechanisms of early - life protection have been described , there are probably many others ."
"although the mechanisms involved were not elored , two recent studies in human birth cohorts from the united states and ecuador have identified fungal dysbiosis as a key feature of infant gut microbiota signatures associated with the development of high - risk asthma phenotypes in childhood ( fujimura et al . , ; arrieta et al . , ) .","it remains unclear whether fungi colonize the healthy adult gut or are simply detected in sequencing studies as transient oral or food - derived fungi ( auchtung et al . , ) , but even transient colonizers of the gut have the potential to impact microbial community ecology and host immune responses ( hallen - adams and suhr , ) ."
"in this model , fungal overgrowth is correlated with inflammatory immune cell infiltration to the lung but also required specific antibiotic - induced changes to the bacterial microbiota .","only antibiotics causing reductions in the relative abundance of bacteria from the genus ( among others ) lactobacillus are associated with fungal overgrowth and exacerbated airway inflammation following antigen challenge ( kim et al . , ) ."
"mice with no pre - existing mycobiota demonstrate a mixed th2 and th17 cell lung infiltrate following inoculation with a dysbiotic fugal community , whereas the same treatment in conventional mice with a pre - existing mycobiome results only in increased th2 cell inflammation during asthma .","similarly , fungi - naive mice newly colonized with c . albicans demonstrate exacerbated aad associated with systemic eansion of fungus - specific th17 cells and il - 17 - hyperresponsive neutrophils ( shao et al . , ) ."
"continuous supplementation with three fungal species identified in this model to be overrepresented in the gut following antifungal treatment ( aspergillus amstelodami , wallemia mellicola [ sebi ] , and epicoccum nigrum ) ( wheeler et al . , ; li et al . , ) or with wallemia mellicola alone following antibiotic treatment ( skalski et al . , ) similarly increases asthma severity ( figure ) ( wheeler et al . , ; skalski et al . , ) .","in addition to antibiotic treatment , antifungal treatment induces changes to both the bacterial and fungal communities in the gut of specific pathogen - free ( spf ) mice and has been shown to exacerbate type allergic airway inflammation and eosinophilia in a hdm model of aad ( wheeler et al . , ; li et al . , ) ."
"subclinical colonization of the lungs with pneumocystis at - 5 months of age has been suggested to be one of the most common infections in infancy ( vargas et al . , ( vargas et al . , , and is associated with increased mucin gene eression ( p rez et al . , ; vargas et al . , vargas et al . , , vargas et al . , , rojas et al . , ) .","early lung colonization with pneumocystis may therefore represent a risk factor for the induction of th2 cell - skewed immune responses in the lung and predispose infants to asthma ( rojas et al . , ) ."
"overall , a picture is emerging wherein patients with asthma exhibit an increase in the relative abundance of specific fungi associated with the induction of type inflammatory immune pathways , some of which are either absent or present only in low abundance in the healthy lung .","in these adults , those with asthma demonstrate an increase in the relative abundance of species of malassezia previously linked to the allergic condition of atopic dermatitis ( van woerden et al . , ) ."
"additionally , increased fungal load in bal samples has been associated with corticosteroid therapy in patients with severe asthma with and without fungal sensitization ( fraczek et al . , ) .","interestingly , some evidence from animal models suggests that sensitization occurs secondary to the natural th2 cell and eosinophilic immune response required for effective clearance of infection - causing fungi ( porter et al . , ) ."
"more recently , studies have begun to precisely characterize the airway mycobiota associated with certain asthma endotypes and clinical features .","in a study examining the microbiota of endotracheal brushings and bal fluid , fusarium , cladosporium , and alternaria ( figure ) species were among the fungal organisms identified to be enriched in the bal of patients with asthma and type high asthma relative to healthy controls and patients with type low asthma , respectively ( sharma et al . , ) ."
"much of this work has been done in pediatric birth cohorts and mouse models , calling for more studies into the relevance of the gut mycobiota to asthma in human adults .","furthermore , if and how early - life fungal dysbiosis influences the onset and / or severity of asthma later in life when the dysbiosis may no longer be present remains to be mechanistically tested ."
"it has been observed that the composition and abundance of the urt and lrt virome differs among healthy subjects and asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with chronic respiratory diseases , but detailed longitudinal studies are needed for better comprehension of the causal relationships ( sundell et al . , ; freer et al . , ) .","complex interactions between viruses and additional environmental and intrinsic factors are probably responsible for the longer but transient presence of some viruses in the respiratory tract of asthmatic patients or the development of fully blown infections leading to severe exacerbations ( vandini et al . , ; sarna et al . , ) ."
"in the first years of human life , almost all wheezing episodes are correlated with viral infections ( mikhail and grayson , ) .","the most common viruses known to induce wheeze or exacerbations of asthma are rv and rsv , but bocavirus , influenza virus , and cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) ( figure ) have also been implicated ( meissner , ; mikhail and grayson , ) ."
"the most abundant cell type in the airways of infants with rv bronchiolitis is neutrophils , although infiltration of eosinophils also plays an important role ( heinonen et al . , ) .","moreover , it has been recently demonstrated that concentrations of mast cells il - 6 , il - 8 , tnf - a , and ifn - a was significantly higher after stimulation with rv ( liu et al . , ) ."
"the capacity of eosinophils to capture virus is reduced up to % with increasing severity of asthma ( sabogal pi eros et al . , ) .","moreover , rsv rapidly adheres to human eosinophils and might be inactivated by these cells ."
"asthma in the setting of influenza infection is associated with worse severity , higher risk of hospitalization , need for intensive care , and mortality ( ritchie et al . , ) .",il - 33 has been hypothesized to be necessary for driving influenza virus - induced asthma exacerbations .
"it has been also demonstrated that subcutaneous injection of hbov - vp1u or b19v - vp1u proteins in ova - sensitized mice resulted in elevated airway inflammation ( chiang et al . , ) .","finally , cmv dna was detected in % of patients with recurrent wheeze and was more prevalent among those aged - 36 months with a positive modified asthma predictive index ( mapi ) than in those of the same age group with a negative mapi ."
"the connection between respiratory viral infections and asthma development has been recently investigated using more mechanistic approaches ( makris and johnston , ; toussaint et al . , ) .","however , the precise mechanisms responsible for the correlation are still unclear and need further detailed investigations in animal models as well as in human studies using multi - omics approaches ."
"methonoarchaea , including methanobrevibacter smithii and methanosphaera stadtmanae ( m . stadtmanae ) , have been proposed as keystone members of this microbial community and possess immunogenic properties ( blais lecours et al . , ; bang et al . , ) .","although understudied , archaea are consistently identified in human microbiota studies and their community composition differs according to body site ( koskinen et al . , ) ."
"thus , more cohort studies and mechanistic studies into the immunomodulatory effects of gut archaea in the context of asthma are needed .","only % of samples tested in this study were positive for m . stadtmanae , however , and certain archaeal proteins have actually been proposed to have pro - inflammatory ( blais lecours et al . , ) or allergenic properties ( bragin et al . , ) ."
"currently , there are only two common mouse models of allergic airway inflammation : ova and hdm - induced acute models , which reflect mainly type asthma .",special attention should also be given to improving in vivo animal models to establish studies that mimic human clinical conditions as closely as possible .
"recent analyses using currently available sequencing methods have allowed us to determine that microbial dysbiosis of the gut and lungs in airway inflammation is characterized by taxa - specific shifts in abundance at the family , genus , species , and even strain levels .","thanks to advances in dna and rna sequencing technologies , it is now possible to characterize many unculturable microbial strains that were not known to be associated with asthma conditions just a few years ago ."
the study of gut microbial compositions in mice and their correlations with airway inflammation should therefore take into consideration gut biogeography .,"moreover , it is well established that the distribution of microbiota differs according to physico - chemcial niches in the gut ."
complete information regarding patient diet and lifestyle should also be carefully prepared to ensure the best overview of patient conditions and potential influences on the microbiota .,"human cohort studies should therefore include clearly defined clinical outcomes and collect longitudinal data from detailed and specified questions about symptoms , treatments , and clinical information ."
"further mechanistic and epidemiological studies are needed to uncover the functional , multidirectional associations between the specific microbiota strains , the host immune system and allergens .",clinical studies of new therapeutics should consider including microbiome and metabolite analyses to determine whether microbiome features correlate with responses to treatment .

"oral delivery is facilitated by hypereression of vaccine antigens against cholera , tetanus , anthrax , plague , or canine parvovirus ( 4% - 31% of total soluble protein , tsp ) in transgenic chloroplasts ( leaves ) or non - green plastids ( carrots , tomato ) as well as the availability of antibiotic free selectable markers or the ability to excise selectable marker genes .","hypereression of several therapeutic proteins , including human serum albumin ( 11.1% tsp ) , somatotropin ( 7% tsp ) , interferon - alpha ( 19% tsp ) , interferon - gamma ( 6% tsp ) , and antimicrobial peptide ( 21.5% tsp ) , facilitates efficient and economic purification ."
"bacteria can be used for large - scale production of proteins , but the products differ from the natural products considerably .",these cells can be cultured on a limited scale but production is quite eensive .
"in addition , the position effect seen in nuclear transgenics can be eliminated as the transgenes are targeted into spacer regions at precise locations in the chloroplast genome by homologous recombination of chloroplast dna flanking sequences .",the problem of gene silencing has not been observed in transgenic chloroplasts in spite of higher eression levels than in nuclear transgenic plants .
"however , oral delivery of vaccine antigens could significantly reduce the cost of their production , purification , storage , and transportation , thereby eliminating the need to maintain the cold chain .","as pointed out above , chloroplast genetic engineering is most suitable for hypereression of vaccine antigens and therapeutic proteins ."
"for oral delivery of vaccines , another important requirement is the eression of the vaccine antigens in plastids of non - green tissues .","for the first time , stable and highly efficient plastid transformation of carrot using non - green tissues as elants , regenerated via somatic embryogenesis , has been reported ( kumar et al ."

cocaine ' s colocalized effects on synaptic serotonin and dopamine in ventral tegmentum in a reinforcement paradigm .,"pharmacol biochem behav , - 898 , . - - the effect of subcutaneous ( sc ) cocaine ( 20"
"moreover , psychostimulant behaviors induced by cocaine were significantly increased over control values ( p < 001 ) .","importantly , da and - ht changes in vta were significantly and positively correlated ( p < 1 ) ."
"indeed , a current report shows that cocaine increased the availability of dopamine ( da ) in situ , in vta in the anesthetized rat ; the report supports the latter hypotheses .","interestingly , cocaine does not act on da in the parallel a9 somatodendrites in substantia nigra ."
"more recent ultrastructural evidence from light and electron microscopy after intraventricular infusion of [ 3 h ] - ht , shows that - ht neurons innervate da - ergic neurons in vta through demonstrated synaptic junctions .",radioautographic and immunohistochemical studies have further shown that vta contains a dense network of - ht anal varicosities .
the purpose of the present study was to elucidate cocaineinduced da and - ht mechanisms simultaneously in vta in the freely moving animal .,"the effects of cocaine on synaptic concentrations of da and - ht were detected in vivo , sequentially , and on - line with in vivo electrochemistry within a psychomotor stimulant paradigm of reinforcement ."
"in addition , specifications for synthesizing the modified carbon paste , which actually constitutes the microelectrode detection device , are published by our laboratory .",detailed procedures for the formulation of each of the microelectrodes in the three - microelectrode assembly are previously published by our laboratory .

"the threemicroelectrode assembly , enclosed within the animal ' s prosthetic acrylic cap , was connected to a cv37 bas detector ( bas , west lafayette , in ) by means of a mercury commutator ( brain research instruments , princeton , n j ) , a flexible cable , and a mating connector ( bjm electronics , staten island , ny ) .","the cv37 detector - potentiostat was electrically connected to a minigard surge suppressor ( jefferson electric , magnetek , ny ) , which was then connected to an isolated electrical ground ."
"in vivo electrochemical signals , and in vitro pre - and postcalibration electrochemical data were measured in units of peak area .",specific details for pre - and postcalibration procedures have been previously published by this laboratory .
"statistically significant differences were also calculated on the individual time - course data points by confidence limits ( cl ) , setting the p value at < 0.05 .","anovas were followed by posthoc tests , that is , fisher plsd ( least square differences ) and the scheffe f test ( statview , brain power inc . , calabasas , ca ) , to determine hourly statistically significant differences in neurotransmitter alterations ."
there was a trend toward basal values in the fourth hour after cocaine .,"thigmotaxic ( agoraphobic ) behavior was dramatically reduced by cocaine , tenfold in the first rain and twentyfold in the first hour after cocaine ."
"further analysis shows that the postcocaine hourly data did not significantly differ ( scheffe f < 37 ) , creating a plateau effect .",rearing behavior was increased by fourfold in the first min and greater than sevenfold in the first hour after administration .
"the data do not rule out , however , the well - known alternative hypothesis , that is , that activation of a negative feedback pathway from enhanced da at the nerve terminal , can cause a suppression of cocaine - induced cell firing .",such a response may lend an elanatory note to the hypothesis that favors cocaine - induced inhibition of impulse frequency rates by somatodendritic autoreceptor regulation .
it is likely that the - ht - ergic effects of cocaine in vta are derived from neighboring - ht somatodendrites .,supporting this suggestion is reported evidence of a - ht - ergic an fiber pathway that relays efferent ascending - ht projections through vta en route to medial forebrain bundle .
"moreover , cocaine - induced - ht - ergic changes maintain a positive correlation with the cocaine - induced da - ergic effects .","indeed , both l0 min and min after ( sc ) cocaine administration , synaptic concentrations of the two biogenic amines , da and - ht are significantly increased to the same extent ."
"although a mediation for da - ergic vta - ( a ~ 0 ) cell bodies has been previously shown to be important in the - ht behavioral syndrome ( i . e . , e . g . , hindlimb abduction , and forepaw tread ) , cocaineinduced hyperactivity does not generally assimilate the - ht behavioral syndrome and is generally thought to be a primarily da - ergic phenomenon .","indeed , classical behavioral hyperactivity , even when the - ht syndrome participates , has been basically associated with activation of da systems ."
the present study was undertaken to clarify the mechanism of extensive jhmv infection of the brain by using neural cells isolated from mice .,"highly neurovirulent mouse hepatitis virus ( mhv ) jhmv strain multiplies in a variety of brain cells , although the eression of its receptor , carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule ( ceacam , mhvr ) , is eressed only in microglia / macrophages in the brain ."
"primary antibodies used for immunocytochemistry or flow cytometry ( facs ) to identify each cell type were as follows ; anti - glial fibrillary acidic protein ( gfap ) polyclonal antibody for astrocytes , o4 monoclonal antibodies ( mabs ) for oligodendrocytes , and map - 2 for neuron .",primary mixed neural cell cultures were established from the forebrains of - to - day - old neonate mice as described previously with minor modifications .
"twenty - four hours postinfection ( pi ) , the majority of cells were included in syncytia and contained viral antigens .",virus - infected fused cells were sporadically detected in neural cell culture at h after wt jhmv infection and the infection rapidly spread regardless of cell type .
"in gs - lectin - positive microglia / macrophages - enriched cultures , wt and srr7 similarly induced syncytia in approximately one - half of cultured cells .",the finding indicates that both viruses spread and efficiently induce syncytium formation in microglia / macrophage cultures .
this indicates that wt virus spread from initially infected cells is not mediated with mhvr .,"we have also done a similar eeriment using either wt or srr7 in failed to prevent the wt virus spread in a similar way observed in srr7 infection , though it reduced wt syncytium formation to a certain extent ."
"wt jhmv spreads from initially infected microglia / macrophages , which is mhvr - dependent manner , to a variety of cells such as astrocytes , oligodendrocytes or neuron in an mhvr - independent fashion as postulated by gallagher and buchmeier ( fig .","the present study indicates that microglia / macrophages are the major population eressing mhvr in the brain , and they are the initial targets for mhv ."

"in ami patients , blood samples were collected before percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) and on days , and .","design and methods : the subjects were ami patients , stable angina pectoris patients ( ap ) and normal subjects ."
"the serum ip - 10 level before pci was negatively correlated with infarct size , as indicated by cumulative release of creatine kinase ( ck ) and peak ck and its isoenzyme ck - mb .",patients with ami showed significantly higher serum ip - 10 levels ( 137.5 pg / ml ) than control subjects ( 91.2 pg / ml ) and patients with ap ( 93.3 pg / ml ) .
"all aspects of the inflammatory response , and subsequent healing processes , occur after ami .",the inflammatory response after ami is known to correlate with infarct size .
"interferon - gamma - inducible protein kda ( ip - 10 , also referred to as cxcl10 ) is a highly inducible , antiangiogenic protein that belongs to the c - x-c chemokine superfamily .",increased serum ip - 10 levels have been reported in atherosclerotic patients .
"all subjects with stable angina pectoris ( ap ) ( n = , men and women ; mean age , years ) had stable effort angina lasting longer than months .","the diagnosis was confirmed by coronary angiography , and defined as n % narrowing of the luminal diameter of at least one diseased vessel ."
"for collection of serum , blood was drawn into pyrogen - free tubes without additives .","the tubes were immediately immersed in ice water , the blood was allowed to clot for h , and centrifuged at g for min , and serum was stored at c until analyzed ."
"serum ip - 10 levels were measured using a one - step sandwich elisa kit for human ip - 10 ( r & d systems , minneapolis , mn , usa ) .","this elisa kit has been widely used for detecting serum ip - 10 levels in a variety of diseases , and the measurement method has been well established in both normal subjects and diseased patients elsewhere ."
lv volume indices were available in patients and were compared with serum ip - 10 levels and indexed for body surface area .,"the frame with the smallest left ventricular ( lv ) volume was taken to show the endsystolic volume ( lv esv ) , and lv volume was calculated using a modification of dodge ' s formula ."
correlations between stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to assess the possible determinants of cumulative ck release .,differences in characteristics across quartiles were compared by anova followed by bonferroni ' s post hoc test for continuous variables and the chisquare test for dichotomous variables .
serum ip - 10 level before pci was significantly negatively correlated with lv esvi and lv edvi ( figs .,a shows that the lv ef ( 4 weeks after the onset of ami ) of patients classified into the lowest ip - 10 tertile was worse than that of patients classified into the middle tertile .
"according to previous reports , the serum ip - 10 levels in normal subjects range from pg / ml to pg / ml .","in this study , we investigated serum ip - 10 levels in gender - and age - matched healthy blood donors ."
"in addition , serum ip - 10 levels were rarely increased in stable angina patients in this study .",our data showing elevated serum ip - 10 levels in ami were in line with these reports .
the mean value of serum ip - 10 in ami patients decreased at days .,it should be noted that only the patients classified into the highest tertile for serum ip - 10 level before pci showed a decrease of serum ip - 10 level at days .
the measurement of this chemokine may provide some information regarding infarct size in ami patients .,"in conclusion , we detected a significant increase of the serum ip - 10 level in ami patients ."
"emergency physicians may be less inclined than infectious diseases specialists to pursue aggressive diagnostic testing and cultures , except in patients who are seriously ill .","whereas in the past decisions regarding initial antibiotic therapy were deferred to admitting primary care and consulting physicians , quality standards currently reinforce timely initiation of antibiotics in the emergency department ( ed ) ."
"issues for which emergency physicians and infectious disease specialists may have different perspectives include the use of blood and sputum cultures , indications for hospital admission , appropriate level of care , and the breadth of antimicrobial spectrum for empiric therapy .","once pneumonia is diagnosed , the priorities in the ed are to provide appropriate respiratory support , assess the severity of disease , initiate appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy based on the most likely pathogens , and make decisions regarding hospitalization and the need for isolation ."
"in most healthy older children and adults , the diagnosis of pneumonia can be reasonably excluded on the basis of history and physical examination , with suspected cases further evaluated by chest radiography .",absence of any abnormalities in vital signs or chest auscultation substantially reduces the likelihood of pneumonia .
"among patients who are suspected of having pneumonia , these clinical findings have been prospectively validated and are better predictors of a radiographic infiltrate than physician judgment .",patients with serious underlying disease or severe sepsis / septic shock in whom hospitalization is considered should have a chest radiograph performed .
"studies of infants with fever show that routine chest radiography is of low yield in the absence of other symptoms or signs of lower respiratory tract infection ( eg , cough , rales , or elevated respiratory rate ) .",routine performance of chest radiography for patients with exacerbation of chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is of low yield and may be limited to patients with other signs of infection or congestive failure .
"although severe dehydration theoretically could result in a diminished exudative response by decreasing blood volume and hydrostatic pressure , this finding has not been demonstrated in eerimental models .",whether the state of hydration can affect the radiographic appearance of pneumonia is unclear .
"when suspicion exists for severe sepsis / septic shock , serum chemistry and coagulation studies may be helpful in evaluating patients for metabolic acidosis , renal and hepatic dysfunction , and disseminated intravascular coagulation .","although cd4 counts usually cannot be obtained within the time frame of an ed visit , total lymphocyte count of less than / mm predicts a higher likelihood of cd4 count less than / mm ."
"for most patients , thoracentesis can be deferred until after hospital admission .","patients in significant respiratory distress or with evidence of tension and mediastinal shift require emergent diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis , however ."
"these findings have poor predictive value , however , and their presence or absence should not guide empiric therapy .","many textbook discussions of pneumonia include clinical features that may predict a specific cause of pneumonia ( eg , ' ' currant jelly ' ' sputum and bulging fissure on chest radiograph for klebsiella pneumoniae , bullous myringitis for mycoplasma ) ."
"this differentiation is somewhat artificial ; a clear differentiation between these two types of pneumonia on clinical grounds alone is impossible , and coinfection can occur .","factors studied prospectively and found not to be more frequent with atypical pneumonias than with pyogenic bacterial etiologies include gradual onset , viral prodrome , absence of rigors , nonproductive cough , lower degree of fever , absence of pleurisy , absence of consolidation , low leukocyte count , and an illdefined infiltrate on chest radiograph ."
"a severe , necrotizing pneumonia in the setting a previously healthy person with influenza should suggest ca - mrsa .","a patient with a history of intravenous drug use and plain chest radiograph with multiple focal infiltrates consistent with septic emboli should be suspected of having endocarditis , which is usually caused by s aureus ( including mrsa ) ."
the routine use of sputum gram stain as a basis for empiric therapy in the ed can be problematic for several reasons .,"sputum gram stain is often recommended as a means to determine the presence of a bacterial pathogen , allowing more specific antimicrobial therapy , but rarely results in a change in therapy or outcome ."
empirical antimicrobial agents are usually highly clinically effective if chosen based on clinical information without sputum analysis .,earlier recommendations regarding sputum analysis arose in the era of narrow spectrum antibiotics and may be less important in the era of broader spectrum agents that are given routinely for empirical treatment .
"blood cultures should be obtained in seriously ill patients ; if drawn , they should be obtained before the initiation of antibiotics ( although antibiotics should not be delayed for this reason ) .","in one prospective study of patients with cap , a change of antibiotic therapy based on blood cultures may have improved clinical outcome in only three cases ( 0.4% ) ."
"increasing reports of severe pneumonia caused by ca - mrsa illustrate the importance of pursuing the cause of pneumonia , at least in some cases .",it is reasonable to target patients with more severe illness for two reasons : the incidence of bacteremia is higher and they have more to lose if empiric therapy is inappropriate .
"blood cultures obtained from patients who do not show signs of serious infection at the time of ed evaluation are of lower yield and often give false - positive results ( ie , contaminants ) .",the follow - up of false - positive blood culture results can be costly and labor intensive and may lead to unnecessary use of agents such as vancomycin or linezolid when results are initially reported as gram - positive cocci in clusters .
it is becoming more common practice for many hospitals and managed care systems to use some type of scoring system to assist with decisions regarding hospitalization for patients who have pneumonia .,"although no firm guidelines exist regarding hospital admission , several well - recognized risk factors are associated with an increased risk of death or a complicated clinical course ."
"additional discharge criteria could include improving and stable vital signs over a several - hour observation period , ability to take oral medications , an ambulatory pulse oximetry more than %, home support , and ability to follow - up .","although this method of assessing the likelihood of successful outpatient management is helpful in establishing general guidelines , it can be cumbersome to use , has not been modeled to predict acute life - threatening events , does not take into account dynamic evaluation over time , and has many important exceptions ( eg , an otherwise low - risk patient with severe hypoxia would be discharged by strict interpretation of this rule ) ."
"factors associated with decreased survival in patients who have aids and pcp include history of prior pcp , elevated respiratory rate , abnormal chest examination , wbc count more than , 300 / mm , elevated lactate dehydrogenase , hypoxemia , hypoalbuminemia , and abnormal chest radiograph .","patients without multiple poor prognostic factors or hypoxia may be discharged from the ed with close outpatient follow - up , ideally within to days ."
the decision to hospitalize a patient with pneumonia is not necessarily a commitment to prolonged inpatient care .,twelve - to - hour ed or hospital ward observation may allow the early discharge of some patients .
objective criteria using the psi ( class v ) and curb - 65 have been proposed but have not been prospectively validated for the icu admission decision .,"when these criteria were retrospectively studied in a cohort of cap patients , they did not perform better than actual physician decisions ."
"many icus in us hospitals are operating at capacity or near capacity , and seriously ill patients are spending more time boarding in eds when no beds are available .","ed overcrowding has adverse impacts that include ambulance diversions and longer transport times , longer waiting times for patients ( some of whom have serious illness that cannot be recognized until they are evaluated by a physician ) , and lower overall quality of care ."
most us eds do not have tb isolation facilities that comply with recommendations of the centers for disease control and prevention .,"patients with tb risk factors often are cared for at busy public hospitals with long waiting times and crowded waiting rooms , which increases risk of health care transmission ."
a systematic review of nine clinical prediction rules for isolating inpatients with suspected tb found that self - reported tb skin test results and upper lobe chest radiograph abnormalities demonstrated the strongest association with the diagnosis of tb .,"these models are limited by the small number of patients included with tb , however , and some are complex point - assignment models that are not easily applied in the busy ed setting ."
"depending on individual risk assessment , other patients with noncavitary pulmonary infiltrates , such as inner - city homeless persons or intravenous drug users , may need to be isolated for possible tb .",chest radiography cannot be relied on to exclude tb in patients who have aids because it often demonstrates diffuse infiltrates as opposed to characteristic cavitary lesions .
"in the ed , empiric antimicrobial therapy for pneumonia is started before a definite microbiologic cause is established .",seriously ill patients who present with severe sepsis or septic shock require fluid resuscitation and vasopressors .
"for various reasons , many facilities have had difficulty meeting this standard in a high proportion of patients .","eds in many us cities face critical overcrowding issues , and patients with pneumonia who do not appear seriously ill at triage may spend hours in the waiting room before evaluation ."
giving the first dose in the ed rather than on arrival to the hospital ward is associated with more rapid time to first dose of antibiotic and shorter length of hospital stay .,"a rush to treatment without a diagnosis of cap can result in inappropriate antibiotic use , however ."

"because of the potential toxicity of sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim ( tmp / sm , empiric treatment with this agent for well - appearing outpatients with a low probability of pcp is generally not recommended .",patients who have hiv present an extra challenge because of possible risk for opportunistic pathogens .
these agents have more reliable activity against drug - resistant s pneumoniae and good oral absorption that provides serum levels comparable to parenteral therapy .,an outpatient regimen of an oral respiratory fluoroquinolone is another option that may be advantageous for moderately ill patients who are considered borderline for hospitalization .
"empiric antibiotics should be initiated in the ed , but using arbitrary time cutoffs for initiating antibiotics as a quality measure for patients ultimately diagnosed as having pneumonia is problematic .",decisions regarding hospital admission and level of care are central to emergency medicine practice and can be aided with prognostic models .

great efforts on the part of governments and public health authorities are necessary to counteract these threats .,"however , the terrorist assaults of september and , subsequently , the anthrax - containing letters are cause for great concerns : new threats to the security of nations are eected , as terrorist organizations seem to increasingly elore novel ways of spreading terror . in this context , naturally emerging diseases such as sars , monkeypox or west nile fever assume new importance because it is difficult to distinguish between natural epidemics and possible bioweapon assaults ."
the geneva protocol of relating to the protection of civilian persons in time of war and additional protocols commit the signatory nations to refraining from the use of biological weapons since these not only have disastrous effects on the armed opponents involved in the conflict but also on the civilian population .,"nevertheless , efforts to develop such weapons continued throughout the cold war and even after its end ; not least because compared to nuclear weapons , biological ones are relatively cheap to develop and produce , earning them the attribute ' ' a poor man ' s atomic bomb ' ' ."
"smallpox was declared eradicated in , following a global eradication campaign led by the world health organization ( who ) .","the only officially remaining smallpox virus stocks are maintained at the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) in atlanta and at vector , the russian viral research institute at koltsovo in siberia ."
"these stocks were supposed to be destroyed in , making the smallpox virus officially extinct .","but the us president at the time , bill clinton , persuaded who members to postpone destroying them until , so more research could be done on new vaccines and drugs and on smallpox genetics ."
additional cases of anthrax were subsequently reported from florida and new york city .,this was the first known ' ' successful ' ' attack after the ineffective aerosolization of a bacillus anthracis suspension in july by the aum shinrikyo sect in tokyo ( also responsible for the sarin nerve gas attack on the tokyo subway system in ) .
"preparations were made for such a program , such as training of medical staff to conduct the vaccinations , etc .","compared to other vaccines currently in routine use , smallpox vaccination using vaccinia virus entails a considerable rate of side effects ."
"while this does not necessarily imply actually harming more than a few people , many modern terrorist groups on the other hand do not seem to pay much attention to the safety , well being or even survival of their own followers .",terrorists will know that using highly infectious agents such as the smallpox virus for biological attacks might well mean their spread also to their own followers because they do not have smallpox vaccine or other preventative measures available .
it has to be taken into account that sophisticated microbiological and biochemical techniques are required to cultivate highly pathogenic biological agents and to make them suitable for use as bioweapons .,"how likely is a bioweapon attack and , more tightly focused , how real is the chance of such an attack by a terrorist group ?"
the cdc have developed a classification system for potential biological agents ; table lists their definitions and gives some prominent examples for each of the three categories .,"particularly categories b and c may be of interest to bioterrorists , due to the fact that some of these agents are not as infectious as those in category a and that dealing with them is , therefore , much easier ."
"cleverly planned arrangements pretending biological attacks can indeed wreak havoc and can cause great eense , particularly because of a lack of systems for the rapid and accurate detection of real bioterrorism incidents and their reliable distinction from hoaxes .","drug resistant m . tuberculosis , nipah virus ) third highest priority agents include emerging pathogens that could be engineered for mass dissemination in the future because of : - availability - ease of production and dissemination - potential for high morbidity and mortality rates and major health impact in the aftermath of the anthrax attacks , with numerous letters allegedly containing b . anthracis spores causing considerable disruption and costs ."
"although there is no evidence that the virus was introduced deliberately , it nonetheless would represent an extremely effective biological weapon .","how this virus covered such a vast distance is unknown ; possibilities include importation of infected birds , infected mosquitoes , or viremic human beings ."
"in the first half year of , a novel infectious disease termed severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) impacted significantly on the medical and scientific world .",severe acute respiratory syndrome it can be difficult to distinguish between natural epidemics and possible bioweapon assaults .
"in china , unemployment especially among the migrant workforce nearly doubled to over eight million ; air traffic to hong kong fell by % in may ; tourism to southeast asia virtually came to a standstill ; and in canada , the loss of tourism and airport revenues amounted to $950 million , $570 million in toronto alone .","in addition , sars had grave social and economic consequences for several countries in east and southeast asia as well as in the western world ."
"instead , sars was another example of how infections may be triggered by agents originating in animals when they adapt to new hosts in whom they may cause dangerous diseases .","although the source of the new virus is still not known for sure , it is likely to be linked to the so - called ' ' wet markets ' ' of southern china and not to have been caused by bioterrorist activity ."
"these cases were quickly linked to contact with pet animals , mostly prairie dogs , obtained from pet shops .","while being held prior to sale to the public , these animals appear to have been infected through contact with gambian giant rats and other animals originating in ghana that were carrying the monkeypox virus ."
"with the advent of recombinant dna technology , however , researchers have techniques at their disposal for altering an organism ' s genetic makeup and thus biological properties .","to date , most discussions regarding the creation of a national biodefense strategy have focused largely on addressing existing threats posed by naturally occurring pathogens and toxins ."
"likewise , technology targeted towards development of transgenic plants and insects that produce a desired protein could also be diverted toward nefarious ends .","not only will advances in biotechnology facilitate novel agents engineered to attack specific human biological systems at the molecular level , but they will permit modification of existing agricultural pathogens and the development of new anti - agricultural and even anti - material agents ."
"it showed that one in five american physicians would be prepared to give the deadly injection to prisoners sentenced to death , % would establish the death of the offender , and % agreed to participate in the procedure in a subordinate way .","it should therefore not come as a surprise if there were enough scientists to develop deadly and poisonous weapons , not only in the former ussr ."
"these include : unusual , uneected clusters of cases ( large numbers of patients with similar symptoms , a large number of unclear illnesses , unelained increase in incidence of an endemic disease ) , an unusual distribution ( appearance of the same agent from different geographical and temporal sources , clusters occurring in geographically distinct areas , etc .",") , unusual modes of spread ( absence of typical vectors or reservoirs , unusual spread of an agent through water , air , food , or a vector ) , atypical clinical courses ( unusually high morbidity and mortality for a given illness , failure of normally adequate therapy , etc ."
"besides assuring an heightened awareness among health care workers to increase the likelihood of early detection , letters can be humidified , for instance , to decrease the risk of aerosolization of the content , or they can be irradiated as done in some us post offices .",there are indeed possibilities to defend society against attacks with suspected biological agents .
there has to be a discussion whether the current cost - intensive smallpox vaccination programs are efficient .,"while the above - mentioned unwanted side effects were acceptable when there was still the danger of a smallpox epidemic , this is no longer true after its eradication ."
increased funding of bioweapon research programs will lead to more individuals with training and skills in this area and might thus have paradox effects .,"on the other hand we have to ensure that scientists comply with regulations and accept the ethical constraints of their activities , as well as apply the necessary safety precautions in their work ."
human mortality from recently emerged diseases ranges from about people due to infection with h5n1 avian influenza a virus to tens of millions of people due to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( aids ) .,"since the s , an increased frequency of infectious outbreaks in both humans and animals has been observed ( figure . 1 ) ."
"collectively , these efforts would result in the identification of the diversity of viruses to which humans are eed , the identification of animal pathogens that may threaten us in the future , and , hopefully , their early detection in humans and subsequently their control ( haagmans et al . , ; kuiken et al . , ; wolfe et al . , ) .",it may even be possible to predict which viruses are most likely to cross the species barrier and what changes may be required for the evolution of an animal pathogen into a human - specific pathogen .
"in this chapter , we describe how genomics may aid in mitigating viral threats , by highlighting potential roles and limitations of genomics approaches in surveillance and diagnostics , and development of vaccines and antivirals ( figure . 2 ) .","as the clinical outcome of an infectious disease depends on properties of both the pathogen and the host , a distinction is made between viral genomics and host genomics ."
"viral genomics can be defined as the study of viral genomes , functions of their individual genes , and interactions of all of the genes present in a viral genome .","most studies involving viral genomics focus on virus discovery and diversity analyses , which in turn positively influence the development and efficacy of surveillance tools , diagnostics , vaccines , and antivirals ( figure . 2 ) ."
"modern genomics - based laboratory techniques , such as generic pcrs , pan - viral microarrays , and sequence - independent amplification combined with high - throughput sequencing , will play an increasingly important role in virus identification and discovery .","apparently , the virus - specific assays currently used in routine diagnostic settings are not equipped for the identification of new and previously unrecognized pathogens ."
"both types of studies will reveal targets for diagnostic , vaccine , and therapeutic strategies , which in turn will be used in surveillance , prevention , and treatment of the disease .","viral genomics aims at identification and characterization of viruses and virus diversity , whereas host genomics focuses on factors that influence how hosts respond to the viral infection ."
"although pan - viral microarrays have considerable advantages over generic pcr assays , especially in terms of broader - reaching and less biased detection of viruses and the possibility of subtyping viruses , highly divergent viruses may still elude identification .","also , implementation as a standard diagnostic assay in clinical settings would require the establishment of a reference library of hybridization signatures for hundreds of individual viral subtypes , training of skilled laboratory workers to read these "" viral barcodes , "" and the ability to create a platform in which the method is cost - effective and reproducible ."
"the major limitation of these methods is their limited suitability for samples in which host nucleic acids and viral nucleic acids cannot easily be separated , such as solid tissues or tissue biopsies .","sequence - independent amplification methods are relatively simple and fast , lack bias towards any virus group , and do not require specific reagents to detect new viruses , even if they are highly divergent from those that are already known ."
there is growing evidence that epidemiological inferences that are made on consensus sequences of populations of viruses within an individual hide information on generic and phenotypic diversity .,genomics - based tools are not only useful for virus identification and characterization ; they also allow investigation of patterns of virus evolution by in - depth sequencing of viral genomes in individual hosts .
both hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) and human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) continue to exert a substantial disease burden on millions of chronically infected patients worldwide .,"these viruses are highly genetically diverse , both within individuals and globally ( rambaut et al . , ; simmonds , ; simmonds et al . , ) ."
genomics data have revealed that genomewide interactions are a critical aspect of influenza virus evolution .,computational analyses of sequence data have changed our views on influenza a virus evolution .
"the challenges for future virus diversity and evolution studies are to integrate viral genomics with data on clinical symptoms and signs , pathology , vaccine development , and antiviral resistance studies .","thus , virus diversity studies can have an impact on vaccine efficacy , antiviral efficacy , and resistance ."
but these mutations do not elain all patient - to - patient differences in pathology .,"following completion of the human genome project , the investigation of underlying heritable mutations capable of inducing or increasing susceptibility to disease has become possible ."
"surveys of genetic variation , with typically hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) in patients with and without a given disease , are performed to identify variant snps that are found significantly more commonly in patients with disease compared with the disease - free controls .",genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) are used to identify genes associated with disease .
"for example , some different heritable mutations involved in development of primary cardiomyopathies have been identified , and it was estimated that snps are responsible for up to % of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( margulies et al . , ) .","many snps , associated with a wide range of diseases and characteristics , have been described ( cooper et al . , ; gudbjartsson et al . , ; liu et al . , ; miyagawa et al . , ) ."
"remarkably , ccr5 , a gene critical for hiv infection , was not detected at all .","this shows the difficulties imposed by strict statistical tests that , although they allow discovery of new genes , also guarantee that many true associations are missed in the process of avoiding false - positive associations ( winkler , ) ."
"similar functional genomics eeriments were performed to identify host cell factors that are temporarily dispensable for the host , but crucial for virus replication of a broad range of influenza a viruses , including highly pathogenic avian h5n1 and pandemic h1n1 viruses ( prusty et al . , ) .","moreover , the effects on disease of the identified gene products in the infected population remain unknown ."
"to fully interpret the results of future studies , data should be incorporated from functional and eression eeriments and virus - mediated changes in gene eression ( ge et al . , ) .","the insights obtained from these types of studies may be used in development of intervention strategies , and hold promise for the personalization of medicine by linking individual genetic information to disease prevention and therapy response ."
"although eression profiling eeriments have been performed for many different viruses , including hiv , hcv , sars coronavirus , influenza a virus , dengue , and west nile , only a few examples will be discussed here to show the principal applications of genomics / proteomics - based tools to study infections with different pathogenic viruses .","treatments may even be tailored to target host response pathways common to many virus infections , which could be used early in infection when an accurate diagnosis is not yet available ."
"in endemic areas with outbreaks of dengue cases , the capacity of medical assistance is limited , and an early discrimination between df patients and patients at risk of developing dhf would allow a more effective allocation of medical attention .",df and dhf patients display a similar clinical picture early after infection .
peripheral blood gene eression signatures have been identified that accurately distinguish individuals with symptomatic acute respiratory infection from uninfected individuals .,"in addition , these gene eression signatures distinguish individuals with respiratory viral infection from bacterial infection , and even distinguish between individuals with respiratory viral infections caused by human rhinovirus , influenza a virus , and respiratory syncytial virus ( zaas et al . , ) ."
"a serum - based protein signature was identified that could accurately predict whether chronic hcv - infected patients would respond to standard - of - care interferon - based therapy prior to treatment ( patel et al . , ) .","as interferon - based therapy is associated with significant side effects and only about half of treated subjects respond to the relatively eensive therapy , accurate prediction of antiviral efficacy is an important tool in the proper tailoring of individual treatment processes ."
gene eression profiling studies in simian immunodeficiency virus ( siv ) - infected natural and non - natural hosts have provided a unique view of how host responses influence lentiviral infection outcome .,many non - human primate species in sub - saharan africa are infected with siv .
"assuming that there is such a conserved injury pathway that can be induced by multiple triggers , including pandemic influenza a viruses , modulation of the host response by type i interferon provides a promising outlook for novel intervention strategies ( smits et al . , a ) .","more recent studies in african green monkeys , however , indicate that distinct sars coronavirus - induced acute lung injury pathways may exist in different host species , which will need to be taken into account when analyzing intervention strategies in these species ( smits et al . , ) ."
"in ferrets , it was shown that infection with h5n1 influenza a virus induced severe disease , with strong eression of cxcl10 , among others .","treatment with an antagonist of the cxcl10 receptor reduced the severity of symptoms and viral titers compared to control animals ( cameron et al . , ) ."
"future efforts should focus on comparing and contrasting the outcomes of infection with closely related viruses in different host species , to delineate the various host pathways and viral traits that cause the differences in disease outcome .","overall , gene eression profiling studies of viral infections provide insight into pathophysiological processes , elucidate biomarkers of disease risk , and allow knowledge - guided development of host response - modulating therapeutic treatments ."
it is clear that genomics - based tools have obtained a firm foothold in many scientific disciplines .,"in combating viral infections , either established or newly emerging , genomics - based tools are predominantly applied to identification and diagnosis of viral infections , virus diversity studies , gwas , genome - wide functional screens , and host gene eression profiling ."
"thirdly , clinical diagnosis of disease will largely change when use of genomics - based tools becomes standard operating procedure , and molecular diagnosticians will need to gain eerience in interpreting the data generated by these radically different and rapidly evolving techniques .","secondly , a large investment in bioinformatics tools , databases and data management is required , to make optimal use of the generated data ."
"for a diagnostic technique so full of potential rewards , the risks are minimal .",any veterinarian with the easily obtained proper supplies can collect bone marrow .
most of these relate to the severity of the cat ' s condition and its ability to tolerate sedation or general anesthesia .,there are few contraindications for collecting a sample of bone marrow when it is warranted .
"most hospitals will have , or can easily obtain , the supplies required to collect a bone marrow sample .","these supplies include a bone marrow biopsy needle , chemical restraint , surgical scrub , sterile fenestrated surgical be substituted ."
"bone marrow can be collected from one of three sites : the proximal humerus ( figure - 2 ) , the iliac crest , or the femur ( figure - 3 ) .","the proximal humerus is easily accessible , has little overlying tissue , and offers a large disposable core - aspiration biopsy needle ( 11 - gauge , inches ) , stylet for the jamshidi biopsy needle , rosenthal reusable core - aspiration biopsy needle ( 16 - gauge , inches ) , stylet for the rosenthal needle ."
local anesthesia will be used for patients in which chemical restraint is contraindicated .,"if a core biopsy will be performed , tissue fixative such as % formalin will be required ."
"a potential , but uncommon , complication with using this site is damage to the sciatic nerve running medial and caudal to the greater trochanter .",the needle is directed parallel to the long axis of the femur .
"after ensuring the proper orientation of the needle , the veterinarian begins advancing through the cortical bone with firm clockwise and counterclockwise rotations while maintaining proper orientation .","when the needle is properly placed , it will feel solidly seated ."
"it tests for the presence of alloantibodies , induced or naturally occurring , for which blood typing does not test .","at the present time , typing for the mik erythrocyte antigen is not readily available ."
the minor cross - match tests for alloantibodies in the plasma of the donor that may attack the recipient ' s erythrocytes .,"autoagglutination in the major crossmatch predicts that antibodies in the recipient ' s plasma will attack the donor ' s red cells , likely eliciting a transfusion reaction ."
"little , if any , pressure should be applied because this may damage the cells .","the sample is allowed to spread a small amount , and then the two slides are rapidly but gently slid apart ."
it is recommended to perform both an aspiration and a core biopsy of the bone marrow so that the procedure does not have to be repeated at a later date .,"aspiration of marrow allows for a cytologic evaluation , but architecture cannot be assessed ."
"however , an excessive number of erythrocytes make blood more viscous , potentially resulting in less than optimal oxygenation .",collecting a core sample of bone marrow from a separate site may increase the likelihood of identifying metastatic neoplasia .
", slide agglutination test a positive , properly performed slide agglutination test suggests the presence of antibody - coated erythrocytes and negates the need for performing a direct coombs ' test .",it is important to differentiate erythrocyte clumping caused by autoagglutination from that caused by rouleaux formation .
an important concept regarding feline anemia is that an increase in the numbers of aggregate reticulocytes ( above the reference range for the laboratory ) is required before a moderate to severe anemia is considered regenerative .,"unless the anemia is mild , and the more immature aggregate reticulocytes are not required , the presence of punctate reticulocytes alone is not evidence of regeneration ."
"increased epo production begins within minutes of onset of hypoxia , with maximal production occurring hours later .",hemoglobin makes up which is produced by fibroblasts adjacent to the renal tubules near the corticomedullary junction in response to decreased local oxygen tension .
"the ribosomes stain a bluish color , giving reticulocytes their characteristic blue - gray color .",their presence in circulation is responsible for the variation in cell size and color observed on a blood smear examination in regenerative anemias .
"as the anemia becomes more severe , younger reticulocytes are released in an attempt to increase the number of oxygencarrying red cells .",it is important to realize that these two types of reticulocytes are not different cells but rather a progression in the maturation of the erythrocyte ( figure - 6 ) .
"because normal feline erythrocytes are small and lack central pallor , spherocytosis in this species is difficult or impossible to appreciate and identification is best left to an eerienced veterinary hemocytologist .","the product of immune - mediated removal of antibodycoated parts of the erythrocyte membrane , after which the cell is reconfigured into a sphere ."
howell - jolly bodies are intracytoplasmic remnants of nuclear material found in erythrocytes that may mimic red cell parasites .,"heinz bodies stain dark with new methylene blue stain , somewhat clear with diff - quik , and the same as the cytoplasm with wright ' s stain ( figures - 9 and - 10 ) ."
breeding two of these cats together would be eected to produce % type b kittens ( b / b ) and % heterozygous type a kittens ( a / b ) .,"however , genetic typing cannot distinguish between type a and type ab ."
"the kitten produces these alloantibodies at approximately to months of age , as a result of eure to antigens on plants , bacteria , or protozoa that are structurally similar to red cell antigens .","understanding feline blood groups is important because , unlike other mammals , cats produce naturally occurring antibodies , called alloantibodies , against the erythrocyte antigens not present on their own cells ."
"approximately % of ragdoll cats are discordant when genotyping is compared to serology , necessitating further investigation in this breed .","in contrast , siamese and related breeds are almost exclusively type a . ragdoll cats appear to be unique with regard to blood types ."
the severity of the clinical signs shown by anemic cats is more often related to the chronicity than degree of anemia .,"chronic anemia allows the cat to adapt physiologically and behaviorally to decreased tissue oxygenation , whereas acute anemia does not allow this adaptation to take place ."
a cbc with a platelet and aggregate reticulocyte count and a blood smear examination will provide evidence of regeneration as long as sufficient time has elapsed since the initial insult .,"if the protein content is low , acute bleeding should be suspected ."
the addition of synthetic colloids may prolong the oncotic effects of a plasma transfusion in these cats .,the use of plasma products to treat hypoalbuminemia is beneficial only in the short - term because transfused albumin rapidly equilibrates with the extravascular space .
"if blood is to be stored for a longer period , citrated anticoagulants should be used .",the required blood volume can be collected into a large syringe .
the volume of whole blood required to increase the pcv to a desired level can be calculated by using the following formula :,this can be accomplished by attempting to raise the pcv to over %.
"for cats with incompatible cross - matches or in cases when blood products are unavailable , oxyglobin ( biopure , cambridge , mass . )",the transfusion should be completed within hours to avoid bacterial contamination and the pcv measured to hours after completion .
screening for cytauxzoonosis is unnecessary because most cats with the disease are ill . tolasmosis and feline infectious peritonitis have not been documented to be transmitted by transfusion .,"heartworm disease cannot be transmitted by blood donation , insofar as the larvae require passage through the mosquito to become infective ."
blood loss anemia can be caused by gastrointestinal bleeding ; the aggregate ones mature .,"if clinical signs are sufficiently severe , a whole blood transfusion should be considered ."
"if the cause of the bleeding is not determined or controlled , loss of iron stores will lead to an iron deficiency anemia .",gastrointestinal bleeding should be considered if a cause for the blood loss is not obvious .
"if the immune - mediated event is associated with another disease , it is a secondary imha .","immune - mediated hemolytic anemia ( imha ) occurs when an immune response is directed against antigens on erythrocytes , leading to their removal by the mononuclear phagocyte system of the spleen ( extravascular hemolysis ) or complement - mediated lysis ( intravascular hemolysis ) ."
fc receptors bind to the fc portion of antibodies attached to pathogens or infected cells and stimulate the activity of phagocytic or cytotoxic cells .,"the antibody - coated cells are removed after antibody binds to the receptor on the macrophage , mostly in the red the reference range for the laboratory ."
a slide agglutination test should be performed on a washed or saline diluted edta blood sample .,"if there is no obvious agglutination on gross examination of the slide , a microscopic exam should be performed ."
"put another way , of the coombs ' - positive cats had primary imha .","if the bleeding is controlled , the transient increase in aggregate reticulocyte numbers is followed by a rise in the number of punctate reticulocytes as after an extensive workup ."
specific immunodiagnostic tests such as a slide agglutination test and a direct coombs ' test should be performed .,a bone marrow evaluation may be useful when a regenerative response to the anemia is equivocal .
the pcv may be surprisingly low for the condition of the patient ; cats seem to tolerate a lower pcv than dogs .,"the hallmark of imha in dogs , spherocytosis , is unlikely to be identified ."
"the cell ' s volume - to - surface - area ratio is reduced , and the cell becomes spherical .","complete phagocytosis may not occur , and only a portion of the membrane may be removed ."
"oral prednisone is the most commonly used glucocorticoid , but it requires conversion by the liver to the active form , prednisolone .","these drugs are both antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive , although higher doses are required to accomplish the latter ."
"the direct coombs ' test may become negative after a patient with imha enters remission , although a few days of immunosuppressive therapy is unlikely to cause a negative test .",a limitation of the test is the inability to differentiate between primary and secondary imha .
therapy for imha depends on the cause and severity of the anemia and must be tailored to the individual .,removal of an underlying cause or trigger will help bring secondary imha under control .
"as with chlorambucil , a white blood cell count should be performed to days after starting the drug .",the dose is to mg / kg orally every hours for consecutive days per week .
", cats have fewer and less sensitive cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors than dogs .","there are few direct effects on b - lymphocytes , and therefore there is little effect on antibody production ."
there is no sense in reducing the dose in a cat that is deteriorating .,it is imperative to ensure the maintenance of remission before each dose reduction .
one involves a pk deficiency ; the other an idiopathic increase in red cell osmotic fragility .,both are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and are identified in young cats with coombs ' - negative hemolytic anemia .
splenectomy should be considered when recurrent hemolytic episodes occur or if closely correlated with the drug ' s area under the curve than trough blood levels and more accurately predicts clinical response .,"because cyclosporine is extensively bound to erythrocytes , whole blood levels are higher than plasma concentrations ."
kohn and coworkers reported a mortality rate of % compared with much higher rates in dogs .,life - threatening complications such as dic or pulmonary thromboembolism also occur at a much lower rate in cats .
therapy depends on whether an underlying condition exists but usually involves the use of immunosuppressive drugs .,diagnosis remains an exclusionary one ; elimination of other disorders by comprehensive investigation is required before making a diagnosis of primary imha .
"cats with pk deficiency have relatively normal osmotic fragility , and those with severe osmotic fragility have normal pk activities .",osmotic fragility testing requires an edta blood sample from both the patient and a control .
the strong hemolytic characteristics of the anti - a alloantibodies found in the serum of type b cats is responsible for the often fatal hemolysis that occurs in very young kittens .,"when the pathologic basis for neonatal isoerythrolysis is understood , it is easy to see how it can be prevented ."
clinical signs appear within the first few hours to days of life and may range in severity from sudden death to development of tail - tip necrosis from vessel obstruction by agglutinating erythrocytes .,kittens at risk are born healthy and become ill only after consuming anti - a antibodies in the colostrum .
"most infections are identified during early spring to early fall , when the ticks are most active .",cats that go outside have an increased the risk of tick eure .
the goal of testing is to logically eliminate potential causes of the clinical signs .,diagnosing a c . felis infection requires an index of suspicion for the disease .
"ideally , the blood would come from the queen because she has no antibodies directed against her own red cells .",kittens start to produce their own anti - b alloantibodies soon after birth .
"if there is concern about lack of passive transfer of maternal immunity in kittens fed milk replacer , ml of serum from a type a cat can be administered subcutaneously or intraperitoneally every hours for the first hours .","alternatively , these kittens can be fed with kitten milk replacer for the first hours ."
"because blood typing is readily available , preventing kitten death from neonatal isoerythrolysis is rather easy .","it is recommended that cats of breeds with high frequency of type b blood , whether intended for breeding or as pets , have their blood typed at the earliest opportunity in case the information is needed in an urgent situation in the future ."
"cytauxzoonosis presently has a limited geographic distribution in the central , south - central , southeastern , and mid - atlantic areas of the united states .",this is also the geographical area where d . variabilis is encountered .
"there is usually only one parasite per red cell , but pairs and tetrads are seen occasionally .","because erythrocyte infection occurs later in the disease , parasitemia may not be present early ; a repeated smear examination should reveal the parasite ."
effective drugs able to eradicate c . felis are not yet available .,"even though antibiotics are not able to directly control the protozoa , they have been used in most cats that have survived ."
the protocol resulted in the survival of of infected cats .,it is possible that some of these cats were infected with the less virulent strain of c . felis .
these cells look like empty circular rims with an attached heinz body .,ghost cells may appear on the slide if the erythrocytes are seen to be extruding the heinz body .
many substances or diseases can produce heinz bodies ( box - 2 ) .,"they may also be the result of drugs , plants , or chemicals with oxidative properties ."
prophylactic use of phosphate supplementation for these patients may be considered if proper monitoring is available .,it is important to remember to evaluate the serum phosphate levels in these cats because the development of anemia can complicate recovery .
another investigation found that % of all anemic cats were positive for hemoplasmosis .,unless there is felv co - infection or co - infection with another hemoplasma .
pcr remains positive in these cats while the bacteria disappears from the erythrocytes and the pcv reaches the reference range .,cats that become carriers have reached a steady state between organism replication and macrophage phagocytosis and removal of become necessary .
cats with these diseases may already have low serum phosphate concentrations ; treatment of the disease may result in a further decrease as egenous insulin is administered to diabetic patients or endogenous insulin increases when chronically anorexic cats are refed .,insulin results in an intracellular shift of phosphate as it follows glucose into cells .
in one report the pcv dropped between and percentage points .,"because of the acute nature of the hemolysis , the anemia will be normocytic and normochromic and appear nonregenerative ."
"the likelihood of finding organisms in this manner is affected by the cyclic nature of the parasitemia and , possibly , by sample handling issues .",slides should be made within hour of collection to prevent the unlikely possibility that the organism will dislodge from the red cells .
"physical findings include fever , pale mucous membranes , splenomegaly , and icterus .",cats infected with candidatus m . haemominutum may have no physical abnormalities at all .
"the anemia caused by feline hemoplasma infection should be macrocytic , normochromic to hypochromic and regenerative if enough time has elapsed to allow production of new erythrocytes .","evaluation of a cat eeriencing the aforementioned clinical signs should include a cbc with a blood smear examination , an aggregate reticulocyte , and a platelet count ; a coombs ' test ; and retroviral testing ."
the rdw is also in the reference range because most of the erythrocytes are similar in size .,these parameters may lie outside the reference range in disorders such as iron deficiency and infection with felv .
"once a nonregenerative anemia has been identified , the goal of further diagnostic procedures is to identify extramarrow causes of the anemia before pursuing intramarrow disorders .","a serum biochemical profile , urinalysis , and retroviral tests should be performed ."
"early in the course of iron deficiency , the anemia is likely to be regenerative .","in most species the anemia of iron deficiency is microcytic ( decreased mcv ) and hypochromic ( decreased mchc ) , but cats are less likely to develop these changes ."
the efficacy of these tactics is unknown insofar as the mode of transmission of the infection is still not clear .,prevention of the disease may include flea control and preventing aggressive interactions with other cats .
"numerous disorders can lead to a nonregenerative anemia , including chronic renal disease , liver disease , inflammatory disease , felv infection , immune - mediated destruction of erythrocyte precursors , and primary bone marrow disease such as neoplasia and myelodysplasia .","lack of regeneration can be caused by decreased epo production , decreased responsiveness of the bone marrow to epo , decreased erythroid precursors in the bone marrow , or iron deficiency ."
"in conditions involving inflammation , ferritin concentrations are eected to be elevated .","a cbc , along with measurement of erythrocyte indices , a blood smear evaluation , and a reticulocyte count , happens to be an acute phase inflammatory protein ."
"the structure of epo is relatively well conserved across species , allowing for biological activity of rhepo in cats .",hormone replacement using rhepo is the treatment of choice for anemia associated with erythropoietic failure in cats with chronic renal failure .
"in a study of cats receiving recombinant feline epo ( rfepo ) , only of cats that responded developed hypertension requiring antihypertensive therapy .","once the anemia is corrected by using rhepo , total peripheral resistance increases , although clinical hypertension is uncommon ."
anemia is an eected consequence of chronic renal disease ( crd ) in cats and contributes significantly to their lack of well - being .,marked azotemia and an inappropriate urine specific gravity are usually present by the time crd causes a significant anemia .
the most important contributing factor to the anemia of crd is epo deficiency .,epo is produced in the peritubular fibroblasts deep in the renal cortex in response to hypoxia .
specific therapy directed at treating anemia of crd includes epo replacement and minimizing blood loss .,an overlooked but obvious consideration is minimizing the number and volume of blood samples obtained when a patient is hospitalized .
macrocytosis without anemia may be seen in some cats with hyperthyroidism .,"if a histogram of red cell size is provided , two peaks may be present , reflecting the two populations of cells : one of normal size and one a bit larger ."
the researchers concluded that felv latency does not play an important role in cats with nonregenerative cytopenias .,"any cat with anemia without obvious cause ( e . g . , trauma , blood loss ) should be checked for the presence of felv antigen ."
"with the availability of rhepo , the ability to control anemia caused by chronic renal failure has improved .","careful patient selection , proper patient monitoring , and constant client communications are crucial to successful management of these patients ."
survival time for a cat with mds is likely to be measured in days to weeks from the time of diagnosis .,"therapy for cats with mds is supportive and may include blood transfusions , antibiotics for those with severe leukopenia , and corticosteroids ."
"acute and chronic leukemia may infiltrate the bone marrow , leading to a nonregenerative anemia .","acute inflammatory lesions in the marrow have been associated with immunemediated hemolytic anemia , bacterial sepsis , and infection with the coronavirus responsible for feline infectious peritonitis ."
"if the cat is evaluated before aggregate reticulocytes are released by the bone marrow , the circulating red cell morphology will appear nonregenerative .","immediately upon bleeding , both red cells and plasma are lost and no decrease in pcv is detected ."
"disorders include aplastic anemia , myelofibrosis , myelodysplasia , and myelophthisis secondary to inflammatory diseases or neoplasia .","many are associated and a "" relative "" increase in the red blood cell volume as measured by the pcv ."
secondary absolute erythrocytosis is associated with increased epo production and is divided further into physiologically appropriate or inappropriate .,"appropriate secondary erythrocytosis occurs as a normal response to systemic hypoxia and is an appropriate , compensatory response ."
"the most common cause in cats is renal disease , including solid tumors or diffusely infiltrative neoplasia , polycystic kidney disease , amyloidosis , or pyelonephritis .",inappropriate secondary erythrocytosis is defined as increased erythrocyte mass without evidence of systemic hypoxia .
"a unfortunately , nonregenerative anemia can be a frustrating problem to solve and sometimes unrewarding to treat .",a lack of increased numbers of aggregate reticulocytes in the face of a decreased pcv is indicative of this type of anemia .
"because renal neoplasia ( both carcinoma and lymphosarcoma ) is the most common cause , imaging of the kidneys is prudent .","abdominal radiography , intravenous pyelography , and abdominal ultrasonography may identify structural abnormalities of the kidneys ."
"epo concentrations would be eected to be low to normal ; if not , the veterinarian should reconsider the likelihood of inappropriate secondary erythrocytosis .","bone marrow examination is not helpful in the diagnosis , insofar as there are no markers for abnormal erythrocyte precursors , and absolute erythrocytosis leads to marrow erythroid hyperplasia , no matter the cause ."
"if cell numbers decrease significantly , the medications should be discontinued until cell counts become normal , and the drug is restarted at a lower dose .","other potential side effects include vomiting , anorexia , and methemoglobinemia at high doses ."
removal of a renal tumor in a patient with secondary inappropriate erythrocytosis may be curative as long as metastasis has not occurred .,the prognosis for cats with erythrocytosis depends on the underlying cause .
abnormal cell numbers in a healthy cat may be normal for that particular cat .,"as with investigating any other body system , evaluation of white blood cells involves integration of the signalment , history , and physical findings with the numbers reported on the cbc ."
neutrophils and lymphocytes are mobilized out of the marginated pool next to the vessel wall and into the,"the fear or excitement a cat eeriences during a trip to the veterinarian results in an increase in epinephrine secretion with subsequent increases in heart rate , blood pressure , and blood flow ."
the goal is to maintain the pcv such that clinical signs are alleviated .,phlebotomy should be the initial treatment for symptomatic cats with absolute erythrocytosis from any cause .
successful treatment of inappropriate secondary erythrocytosis resulting from epo - secreting tumors involves surgical removal of the offending neoplasm after stabilization of the cat ' s clinical status and pcv .,therapy for relative erythrocytosis involves volume eansion with appropriate intravenous fluids or blood products and correction of the underlying cause .
appropriate secondary erythrocytosis is a compensatory mechanism to combat hypoxia ; therefore removing too much blood by phlebotomy may exacerbate the hypoxia eerienced by the cat .,"systemic oxygenation declines with a pcv over %, so the veterinarian should attempt to maintain a pcv in the range of % to %."
hydroxyurea is an alkylating chemotherapeutic agent that suppresses production of erythrocytes .,"if the procedure needs to be performed too frequently or is ineffective in maintaining the pcv at an appropriate level , the addition of hydroxyurea should be considered ."
"inflammation from many different causes increases demands for neutrophils , and the bone marrow responds through increased release of stored mature neutrophils and accelerated production of new neutrophils .","the number of neutrophils in the blood represents balances among bone marrow production and release , physiologic changes in blood flow , diapedesis , and tissue demands ."
"when tissue requirements for neutrophils outpaces the bone marrow ' s ability to replace them , most of the mature neutrophils will be in the tissues and the circulating neutrophils will be composed mostly of immature cells .","if the number of bands ( or other immature neutrophils ) is greater than the number of mature neutrophils , a degenerative left shift is present and is often associated with a guarded to poor prognosis ."
in one study the presence of toxic neutrophils was associated with longer hospitalization .,"this same study also found that , unlike dogs , toxicity was not associated with increased mortality in cats ."
"because many of the neutrophils in cats are in the marginated pool , the increase in neutrophil numbers can be significant , up to three to four times the upper level of the reference range .",the same degree of increase may be eected in the lymphocyte count .
moderate neutropenia is associated with hypoplastic bone marrow and must be differentiated from infection with feline parvovirus .,mild neutropenia appears to be the most common change and is associated with mild lymphopenia and normal hematopoiesis .
these kittens are t cell deficient as a result of thymic atrophy and die within a few days of birth .,a severe combined immunodeficiency has been identified in birman kittens born hairless .
"a single megakaryocyte may produce thousands of platelets , with thrombopoiesis taking approximately days .","the survival time of platelets in circulation is to days , after which they are removed by macrophages of the mononuclear phagocyte system in the spleen ."
mediators of secondary hemostasis are produced in the liver ( clotting factors ) and cells in and surrounding the vessel wall ( tissue factor ) .,clotting factors are released into circulation in inactive form and require activation to become functional .
"affected cats should not be bred , and their unaffected parents , who are obligate carriers , should be removed from breeding programs .","a bone marrow transplant may resolve the neutrophil and platelet dysfunction , but the neurologic and renal changes will remain ."
a healthy cat with this anomaly may be reported as having a degenerative left shift without toxic change .,"affected neutrophils resemble immature band cells ; affected cells , however , have mature , clumped chromatin ."
a definitive diagnosis is based on identification of decreased factor ix activity .,"once the gene encoding the feline factor ix protein is sequenced , a genetic test may become fibrinogen to soluble fibrin and amplifies the coagulation process by activating other procoagulant factors , particularly those of the intrinsic pathway ."
the presence of heparin on the surface of the vascular endothelial cell augments the function of at and helps control clot formation at the edges of the damaged vessel localizing the clot to the damaged area .,"like factors ii , vii , ix and x , synthesis of protein c and protein s is vitamin k dependent , and they are released in inactive form by the liver ."
clot dissolution is mediated by plasmin produced by the liver as plasminogen .,"tissue plasminogen activator ( tpa ) is produced by endothelial cells and , as its name suggests , activates plasminogen ."
"the patient may be volume contracted or have signs of anemia such as weakness , lethargy , pallor , or respiratory distress .","many platelet disorders are secondary to other diseases , and the patient may exhibit signs related to that disease ."
inhibition of clotting factors and intrinsic anticoagulants are also potential mechanisms by which substances produced by neoplasms can affect the clotting system .,neoplasms can also cause hemostatic abnormalities by causing thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction or by producing procoagulants .
"felv infection , a common cause of thrombocytopenia , is also associated with increased platelet volume .",spontaneous bleeding caused by thrombocytopenia in cats usually occurs only when the platelet count is lower than / l .
unnecessary trauma such as elective surgery or intramuscular injections should be avoided .,"however , should collection of bone marrow be required , the veterinarian should not hesitate to perform the procedure because bleeding is rarely a problem ."
"because cats usually tolerate thrombocytopenia without excessive bleeding , platelet transfusion should be considered when the count is less than / l , which is rarely encountered in this species .",blood administered to patients with dic is more effective in controlling clotting factor consumption if heparin is used at the same time .
", a combination of prolonged pt and aptt , thrombocytopenia , and elevations in d - dimers is consistent with a diagnosis of consumptive coagulopathy , particularly if there are signs compatible with dic or a disease known to cause dic ( e . g . , neoplasia ) is present .",controversy exists regarding the sensitivity of the d - dimers test for the detection of dic in cats .
lack of eerience in dealing with these disorders contributes to the difficulty .,"fortunately , hemostatic diseases in cats are rare , and significant spontaneous bleeding is even more uncommon ."
"the functions of the spleen include storage of erythrocytes and platelets , extramedullary hematopoiesis , and blood filtration .",understanding the microanatomy of the spleen is necessary to understand its function in health and disease .
some of the arterioles entering the white pulp continue on to the venous side of the circulation .,blood enters at the hilus and makes its way through small arterioles to capillaries terminating in the lymphoid nodules of the white pulp or to capillaries leading into the red pulp .
"similar to imha , these antibodies may be directed against antigens on the surface of the platelet or against antigens similar in structure to platelet antigens .",immune - mediated thrombocytopenia ( imtp ) is caused by the removal of antibody - coated platelets by macrophages in the spleen .
once the where they are phagocytosed and sent by macrophages to the lymphoid follicles in the white pulp for further processing .,the spleen also removes antibody - coated erythrocytes ( extravascular hemolysis ) and platelets during immune - mediated events .
visualizing the spleen is important in determining the type of enlargement .,"abdominal radiography allows for easy visualization of the spleen , although the location varies owing to its mobility within the abdomen ."
"owing to the nonsinusoidal nature of the feline spleen , the cat is less efficient at removing these cells than is the dog and is one reason that normal cats have higher numbers of heinz bodies present in the circulation .","in addition to obsolete erythrocytes , the spleen also removes bacteria from the blood ."
aspiration biopsies may be unnecessary in cats with diffuse homogeneous splenomegaly without clinical signs .,"cavitated lesions , while uncommon in cats , are best dealt with by splenectomy ."
portal venous or caudal vena caval obstruction or congestion from right - sided heart failure will infrequently cause splenic congestion .,infarcts may occur secondary to hepatic or renal disease and may obstruct the efferent blood supply .
a fine - needle aspiration biopsy of a lesion may be sufficient because most diseases of the spleen exfoliate readily .,"in a study evaluating the correlation of the sonographic appearance of splenic lesions to cytologic and histologic diagnoses in dogs and cats , of the aspirated samples matched the histologic diagnosis ."
"in a report of cats undergoing splenectomy for various reasons , only weight loss had any prognostic significance .",the median survival time following splenectomy for the three cats with weight loss was days compared with days for those without .
"the easiest , fastest , and most noninvasive means of obtaining information about a palpably enlarged lymph node is a fine - needle biopsy .",numerous diagnostic procedures are available to evaluate a cat with lymphadenopathy .
an eloratory laparotomy should be considered if a lymph node presents as a large abdominal mass .,thoracic radiographs and thoracic and abdominal ultrasound examination may reveal an enlarged lymph node in these areas .
"if an underlying cause cannot be identified , the temptation to use glucocorticoids in an attempt to shrink the size of the lymph node should be resisted .",idiopathic lymphadenopathies have been reported in cats that either require only patience or can be treated surgically .
"this changes cell proliferation , differentiation , or function , often in concert with other mediators .",circulating non - cell - associated receptors for the cytokines may be present to prevent systemic actions if some should reach the circulation .
"many cats may prove to have curable diseases when approached with a systematic , logical evaluation .","because lymphadenopathy has many potential causes , a cat presenting with generalized lymphadenopathy should not automatically be convicted of having malignant disease ."
"they affect multiple cell types and are important enough that the effects often overlap those of other cytokines , acting as a natural backup system .","some cytokines have different effects depending on the concentration ; for example , interferon ( inf ) - alpha has immunostimulating properties at low concentrations but immunoinhibitory"
manipulation of a single cytokine may trigger mechanisms that control its activity and neutralize or enhance its effect .,"no treatment is without potential adverse effects , and cytokine therapy is no exception ."
"in health fewer than % of immune cells have endothelial cells and may find uses in treating aplastic anemia , myelofibrosis , or bone marrow toxicity .","as with all cytokines , they act by binding to specific receptors on the effector cell ."
dogs with generalized demodicosis have decreased eression of il - 2 and decreased numbers of lymphocytes with il - 2 receptors .,production of il - 2 by feline lymphocytes infected with retroviruses is decreased .
"using g - csf to reverse an established neutropenia , such as seen in cats with felv infection , is unrewarding .",the action of rh - g - csf in cats ends when the patient starts making antibodies against the cytokine .
purebred cats are more likely to be affected than domestic cats .,"young to middle - aged cats are most commonly affected , and unlike in humans , there is no gender predilection ."
these signs may be exacerbated by ultraviolet radiation from the sun or concurrent infection .,"these can include fever ; lameness ; muscle pain ; lymphadenopathy ; ulcerative stomatitis ; skin lesions such as crusts , erythema , and ulceration ; depigmentation around the head and paws ; pale mucous membranes ; and central nervous system signs ranging from subtle behavioral changes to alterations in mentation and seizures ."
"increased il - 10 , an immunosuppressive t h cytokine , was found in the early stages of fiv infection corresponding to high viral replication .",this area of study may be important in designing prevention and therapies for infections with fiv .
"the syndrome mimics many other disorders , and diagnosis can be difficult because diseases including infectious and neoplastic causes must first be eliminated .","the most commonly affected tissues in cats include synovial joints , glomeruli , skin , blood cells , and the central nervous system ( box - 10 ) ."
"chlorambucil is well tolerated , with minimal side effects ; however , the dose must be individualized to the particular patient .",additional immunosuppression can be achieved by adding cytotoxic drugs such as chlorambucil .
remission is defined as resolution of clinical signs and initial radiographic and laboratory changes .,"if combination therapy has been used , the chlorambucil should be reduced first ."
diagnosis of sle requires an increased index of suspicion for a cat with apparent multisystemic disease .,various criteria have been proposed for the diagnosis of sle in dogs and cats based on those used for the diagnosis in people .
this occurs between and hours after eure to the antigen .,"cytokines produced by mast cells include il - 4 , il - 5 , il - 6 , il - 13 , il - 16 , tumor necrosis factor - alpha , and macrophage inflammatory protein - alpha ."
the inflammatory mediators released by mast cells result in grave consequences if not treated promptly .,"systemic anaphylaxis is a life - threatening allergic event resulting in massive , generalized mast cell degranulation ."
"most animals produce iga or igg when eed to an environmental allergen , whereas others have an exaggerated t h response and produce excessive amounts of ige .","many different substances can play the role of antigen , including drugs such as nsaids and antibiotics , insect or reptile venom , food , vaccines , and inhaled allergens ."
"these mediators , which include but are not limited to histamine , heparin , kallikrein , and inflammatory cell chemotactic factors , result in physiologic changes responsible for many of the clinical signs recognized as anaphylactic shock .",histamine bound to h receptors causes smooth muscle contraction in the intestinal tract and in the airways and pulmonary vasculature .
"a positive response to parenteral fluid and epinephrine administration should be noticed within minutes of all that time will allow , insofar as many are lifethreateningly ill . a detailed history and physical examination of less severely affected cats may yield clues to the cause of the anaphylaxis .",an insect stinger in the tongue of a cat with open - mouth breathing is suggestive of an allergic reaction to a bee sting .
the veterinarian must first ensure that the airway is patent and be ready to intubate if laryngeal edema is causing an airway obstruction .,following the precepts of basic emergency medicine gives the veterinarian the best chance at success .
after the first hour the cat should be reassessed and fluids continued .,fluid rates will likely need to be greater than maintenance rates but should be tailored to the individual patient .
"h - receptorblocking antihistamines such as diphenhydramine ( benadryl , mcneil ppc ) at to mg / kg administered slowly and intravenously or tripelennamine mg / kg intravenously or intramuscularly may reduce the further effects of histamine on the target tissues .",rapid - acting glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone sodium phosphate at to mg / kg intravenously may be beneficial by enhancing beta - receptor sensitivity and decreasing phospholipase a activity .
the prognosis for these patients varies with the individual and the individual ' s response to initial therapy .,the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in cats with anaphylactic shock depends on timely and aggressive action on the part of the veterinarian and support staff .
", 2 although epstein barr virus ( ebv ) has been recognized as the most frequently detected microorganism , other respiratory viruses such as parainfluenza virus ( piv ) or adenovirus have been described associated with parotitis .",nowadays the parotitis cases are usually related to other viral infections in countries with high vaccination coverage .
the authors observed an incidence of hbov infection of - 1% in their studied cases .,", 2 these two cases were detected in two prospective studies that surveyed the frequency of several viruses in sporadic parotitis in korea and u . s . a ."
"cervical ultrasound revealed an enlarged left parotid gland , with multiple internal lesions of low echogenicity in relation to intraglandular inflammatory changes .",the chest x - ray demonstrated an infiltrate in the right middle lobe .
", 2 however , the parotid gland could be a target of infection for this virus , as occurs in adenoids , where some authors have identified hbov in up to % of the specimens obtained from children with adenoidal disease .",", to date , only in two cases has hbov been associated with mumps but its pathogenic role as a causative agent of parotitis is discussed , since in one case it has been detected in coinfection with piv ."
prospective studies should be designed to verify the truly pathogenic role in parotitis cases .,we consider that hbov should be taken into consideration as an infrequent but possible causative agent of acute parotitis in young children .
"most diseases were of respiratory nature , but concurrent with the upsurge of ev - d68 , the centers for disease control and prevention ( atlanta , ga , usa ) recorded cases of acute flaccid myelitis ( afm ) .","approximately , 100 respiratory ev - d68 infections were recorded , mostly in children , many of whom required intensive care unit ( icu ) admission ."
"to raise awareness of this upsurge and the severity of ev - d68 infections , we report on cases .","in addition , we show the phylogenetic relationship between the ev - d68 strains and those that circulated in ."
"we perform routine diagnostic real - time pcr for all patients evaluated for respiratory disease by laboratory developed tests for targets , including adenovirus , bocavirus , coronavirus , enterovirus , metapneumovirus , influenza , parainfluenzavirus , rhinovirus , and respiratory syncytial virus .",the university medical center groningen is a tertiary referral center in the northern part of the netherlands .
"we found a stable seasonal variance for enterovirus and a sudden rise of enterovirus infections in july , mainly caused by ev - d68 ( figure ) .",we identified ev - d68 infections in june and additional cases in july .
"two viral respiratory co - infections were detected : rhinovirus a15 in patient ( enterovirus c t , rhinovirus c t ) and parainfluenzavirus type in patient ( enterovirus c t , parainfluenza virus c t ) .","for patients , we obtained sequence results identifying ev - d68 ; the remaining could not be typed by sequencing but were positive in our specific ev - d68 pcr ."
"in children , however , we observed life - threatening respiratory distress , for which icu admission was necessary for ( table ) .","twenty - one patients had an underlying or concurrent condition , in the children mostly pulmonary ."
we obtained sequences of part of the ev - d68 viral protein gene and aligned them with the sequences from the epidemic .,"clades were assigned as described previously by the neighbor - joining method by using bionumerics software ( applied maths / biom rieux , sint - martens - latem , belgium ) ."
we recognized a sudden reappearance of ev - d68 with a sharp increase of cases that could not be elained by a change in surveillance strategy .,"this so - called regiotype strategy contributed to timely detection of ev - d68 in our hospital in , as well as in ."
the number of children who needed icu admission was higher in than in our and reports .,"in line with previous outbreaks , mostly children were affected , and those with underlying pulmonary conditions seemed at higher risk for icu admission ."
"mri findings were subtle , and radiologic diagnosis was made only after further review and discussion of the case with the neurologists .","in patient , atypical guillain - barr syndrome initially was diagnosed ; however , this diagnosis was later discarded because the electromyography results indicated motoric an or anterior horn cell disease , and the clinical picture and mri results were in favor of afm ."
larger epidemiologic and genotyping studies are needed to evaluate whether the distinction within clade b is tenable and whether our clinical findings are typical for subclade b3 .,"during the outbreak , most ev - d68 sequences belonged to clades b1 and b2 , although a1 and a2 were also represented ."
"this upsurge could indicate an active ev - d68 season , as highlighted by the epidemiologic curve , with a potential increase in afm cases .","clinicians should be alert for ev - d68 , its clinical implications , and the need for appropriate diagnostics , particularly in children who are admitted with respiratory failure to the icu or with possible symptoms of afm ."
"in addition , we showed that pmo or - o - methyl phosphorothioate is taken up efficiently into c2c12 myotubes when transfected - 72 h after the induction of differentiation but is poorly taken up into undifferentiated c2c12 myoblasts suggesting efficient uptake of pmo in the early stages of c2c12 myotube formation .","next , we tested the therapeutic potential of pmo for laminin - a2 chain - null dy k / dy k mice : a model of merosindeficient congenital muscular dystrophy ( mdc1a ) with active muscle regeneration ."
the milder becker muscular dystrophy ( bmd ) typically results from in - frame deletions in the dmd gene that allows the eression of limited amounts of an internally truncated but functional protein .,"dmd is caused mainly by a frameshift deletion , nonsense or duplication mutations in the dmd gene , which encodes the protein dystrophin ."
"in recent years , rna - targeted splice - correction therapy by antisense oligonucleotide ( ao ) in dmd muscle with the object of restoring an in - frame , becker - like transcript is among the more promising therapeutic approaches to treating dmd .","to this end , systemic administration of ao , such as phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers ( pmos ) , targeting specific en ( s ) in the dmd gene has been shown to restore the reading frame and induce body - wide production of partially functional bmd - like dystrophin in mouse and dog models of dmd ."
"however , the poor delivery of the pmo limits the application of pmo - mediated therapy for dmd or other muscular dystrophies .","moreover , pmo is being used extensively as a tool for selective inhibition of gene eression in cell culture models ."
we also tested the therapeutic potential of pmo treatment on the dy k / dy k mouse : a model of laminin - a2 chain ( merosin ) - deficient congenital muscular dystrophy ( mdc1a ) ( mim156225 ) with active muscle regeneration .,our results support the idea that pmo entry into muscle fibers is dependent on a developmental stage in myogenesis rather than on an intrinsic defect in the membrane of dystrophinless muscle fibers : the ' leaky - membrane ' hypothesis .
"s1a ) , we injected - week - old m 52 and bl6 wt mice with a single dose of do ( table ) , which targets the splice donor site of en of the dmd gene , at a range of doses , , or mg / kg .","two weeks after the injection , the gastrocnemius muscles were isolated and analyzed by reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) ."
"one hour later , the mice were killed and the ta muscles were removed for analysis by in situ hybridization with digoxigenin - alkaline phosphatase probes .","this revealed that pmo do was mainly present in the nucleus and to a lesser extent in the cytosol of small - caliber ( , 35 mm ) - regenerated fibers , but was barely detectable in normal - caliber fibers with peripheral nuclei ( fig ."
skipping en of the murine lama2 gene in dy k / dy k mice corrects the open reading frame and could lead to the production of a truncated laminin - a2 chain ( fig .,"finally , we performed pmo - mediated en skipping for dy k / dy k mice , which are an animal model of laminin - a2 chaindeficient congenital muscular dystrophy and show severe dystrophic change with active muscle regeneration ."
pmo is also being used extensively as a tool for selective inhibition of gene eression in cell culture models .,these characteristics of pmo contribute to their extremely low toxicity and suitability for use in human .
this hypothesis is based on the clinical evidence that dystrophin - deficient muscle fibers are prone to be injured by contraction and that the injury causes leakage of soluble cytoplasmic proteins such as creatine kinase .,"at present , the changes of membrane permeability of dystrophin - deficient muscle membrane , so - called ' leaky membrane hypothesis ' , facilitating a route of entry for the pmo into myofibers , are a favored elanation for pmo uptake ."
but we still face issues of off - target effects or high toxicity in humans because of the nonspecific delivery - facilitated properties and the facilitated interactions with other proteins .,"to overcome this delivery issue with pmo , recent developments using cell - penetrating peptide - conjugated pmo , where a short cationic peptides that penetrate cells by interacting with the negatively charged plasma membrane , may become an effective strategy for reducing both dose levels and administration frequencies ."
we also showed that pmo and omeps is taken up efficiently in the early stages of c2c12 myotube formation .,"taken together , our in vivo study by ctx injection suggests pmo uptake is more prominent during stages from myogenic differentiation to myotube formation than cell proliferation stage ."
"our results can provide a platform for developing pmo - mediated therapies for a variety of muscular disorders , such as mdc1a , that involve active muscle regeneration .","in conclusion , pmo or omeps is taken up preferentially into mouse muscle cells during myotube fusion ."
male m 52 mice ages weeks and wt mice age weeks were used in this study .,"heterozygous lama2 gene - targeted dy k mice , which have a pmc1neo polya + cassette in en of the lama2 gene , were maintained in our animal facility ."
"brdu solution was prepared in sterile water , protected from light eure and changed daily .",mice were treated with mg / ml brdu in their drinking water for days .
"the sequence was synthesized using a pmo , f - pmo ( gene tools , llc , philomath , or , usa ) or omeps ( operon biotechnologies , tokyo , japan ) .",primers for rt - pcr and sequencing analysis were synthesized by operon biotechnologies and are listed in table .
"for the systemic studies , a dose of - 640 mg / kg pmo in ml of saline or ml saline was injected into the tail vein of m 52 mice or wt mice , singly , and mice were examined weeks after the injection .","muscles were dissected immediately , snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen - cooled isopentane and stored at c for rt - pcr , immunohistochemistry and western blotting ."
"in the % differentiation medium , c2c12 myotubes were incubated up to days .","we then transfected pmo or omeps at the final concentration of or mm , respectively , into c2c12 myotubes without any transfection agents and incubated them for h ."
"the intensity of pcr bands was analyzed using imagej software , and skipping efficiency was calculated by using the following formula : [ ( the intensity of skipped band ) / ( the intensity of skipped band + the intensity of unskipped band ) ] .","the cycling conditions were c for min , then cycles of c for min , c for min , c for min and finally c for min ."
"dapi containing a mounting agent ( vectashield ; vector laboratories , burlingame , ca , usa ) was used for nuclear counterstaining .","alexa - 488 or ( molecular probes , cambridge , uk ) was used as a secondary antibody ."

"furthermore , nuclear translocation of activated stat1 and a range of interferon - stimulated genes could be demonstrated in the lungs of sars - cov - infected macaques .","in line with these observations , plasmacytoid dendritic cells have been shown to produce interferons upon sars - cov infection in vitro ."
"rapid spread of the virus owing to air travel , immediate media coverage all over the world and the globalization of the economy contributed to the high impact of the epidemic .","the emergence of this new highly pathogenic virus led to a quick response from the scientific world ; only a few months after the first emergence of sars , a newly discovered coronavirus ( cov ) was identified as its etiological agent ."
we also observed elevated levels of these inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs of cynomolgus macaques that were eerimentally infected with sars - cov as evidenced by microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription - pcr .,significant induction of these inflammatory agents was also observed in human sars patients and has been described as a ' cytokine storm ' .
"given the importance of interferons in antiviral defence , considerable efforts have been made to analyze whether sars - cov blocks induction of interferons .",this review will focus on the apparent discrepancies in reports analyzing the induction of interferons by sars - cov .
"ifn - , a single type - ii interferon , is not secreted in direct response to viral infection but produced by activated t cells and natural killer cells .","in principal , most mammalian cells are capable of producing type - i interferons , however , the mechanism and amount of interferons that are induced can differ among cell types ."
"the induction of interferon leads to the production of irf - 7 , which is only present in low amounts in most cells .","ongoing viral replication subsequently induces the activation of transcription factors nuclear factor ( nf ) - b and ap - 1 , which both bind the ifn - promoter and further enhance ifn - gene eression ."
"this pathway is used by pdcs , which are also known as ' professional type - i interferon producers ' .",pdcs predominantly sense viral rna through the endosomal tlr7 and tlr8 .
"another possibility is that one of the sars - cov viral proteins sequesters the genomic rna in such a way that host - sensing proteins do not detect it as has been demonstrated for several other viruses , such as vp35 from ebola and ns1 of influenza .",it remains to be proven if sars - cov actively inhibits interferon production or just escapes from the induction of interferons .
"these data demonstrate that , although sars - cov blocks interferon induction in vitro , type - i interferons are still produced during sars - cov infections in vivo .","in accordance with our macaque data , a recent study using material from clinically well described sars cases revealed high levels of type - i interferon in plasma and robust interferon stimulated gene eression in precrisis sars patients ."
"while interferons cannot be detected in sars - cov - infected myeloid dcs , pdcs rapidly produce and secrete considerable amounts of ifn - and ifn - upon sars - cov infection .","they found that , in contrast to earlier reports from studies performed in in vitro cell cultures , interferon induction is not inhibited in pdcs after sars - cov infection ."
"pdcs are known to be the most potent producers of ifn - in the human body , producing - 100 times more type - i interferons than other cell types , and type - i and type - iii interferons account for % of the total genes eressed in activated pdcs .","although there is no proof as yet that pdcs are responsible for the induction of interferons during sars - cov infection in vivo , the fact that pdcs are able to produce type - i interferons upon sars - cov infection in vitro is suggestive for their role in vivo ."
"as soon as ifn - and ifn - bind to the common type - i interferon receptor ( composed of the products of the ifnar1 and the ifnar2 genes ) , conformational changes in the intracellular part of the receptor lead to the activation of the jak / signal transducers and activators of transcription ( stat ) signaling pathway .","the cytoplasmic tails of ifnar1 and ifnar2 associate with tyrosine kinase and tyrosine kinase janus , respectively , leading to binding and activation of stat1 and stat2 ."
"more than isgs are induced by ifn - / , leading to a wide array of biological effects in the host cell .","for example , the g1 / s phase - specific cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor p21 triggers cell cycle arrest , while proteins such as procaspases , pkr and oas have an antiviral effect by causing apoptosis ."
"for example , the orf7a protein and nsp - 1 were observed to inhibit cellular protein synthesis and promote host cell mrna degradation , respectively .","in addition , the sars - cov proteins orf3b and orf6 inhibit interferon signaling through the jak / stat pathway both passively and actively ."
"a red bar indicates that the particular gene is upregulated in sars - cov - infected macaques , as compared with mock - infected macaques , while a green bar indicates that the gene is downregulated .","each gene - included pathway is illustrated with an individual heatmap , representing differential eression of that particular gene in a sars - cov - infected macaque compared with a mock - infected ( phosphate - buffered saline ) macaque ."
"interestingly , it has been demonstrated that ifn - downregulates eression of ace2 , the cellular sars - cov receptor , on the cell surface , resulting in decreased infection in these cells .",pretreatment of cells with interferon before infection prevents sars - cov replication in these cells .
"it has been shown that inflammatory cytokines like il - 1 , il - 6 and il - 8 are produced at higher levels in elderly people as compared with the young , making them more vulnerable for the development of ards after sars - cov infection .","however , it is hypothesized that sars pathology is caused by an disproportional immune response , characterized by the induction of several inflammatory cytokines ."
"ards is a severe form of acute lung failure and cannot only be triggered by sars - cov , but also by other pathogens such as h5n1 avian influenza and anthrax .","furthermore , a variety of other conditions like sepsis , pancreatitis and severe trauma can lead to ards ."
sars - cov spread rapidly from china to several other countries across the globe and its emergence had a significant economical impact .,more than people were infected of whom nearly % died .
"although most mammalian cells are capable of producing type - i interferons , plasmacytoid dendritic cells , also known as ' professional ' interferon producers , produce much higher amounts of ifn - than other cell types .",type - i interferons are induced in direct response to viral infection and play an important role in innate immunity .
"although ards - associated mortality remains very high , no successful pharmacological therapies have been developed for ards as yet .",patients with severe cases of sars develop pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) .
insights into the complex regulation of the interferon response during sars - cov may provide clues for intervention strategies based on the use of interferons .,"however , more research in appropriate sars animal models should be performed to address this issue ."
individual heatmaps were created for each gene by comparing gene eression in the sars - cov - infected animal to eression of that gene in a pool of mockinfected animals .,"the top bar of each heatmap represents differential gene eression at day , the middle bar represents differential gene eression at day and the lower bar represents differential gene eression at day in lung areas where no virus was detected by taqman ."
"one hundred and twenty healthy holstein calves were assigned randomly at birth to one of four groups ; each group contained calves and the calves were received as follows : group a , g of lyophilized colostrum powder dissolved in kg of whole milk ; group b , g of spraydried colostrum powder dissolved in kg of whole milk ; group c , ml frozen and thawed colostrum in kg of whole milk , and group d , only kg of whole milk without colostrum supplement .",each group was subdivided into sub - groups of calves as follows : calves fed colostrum supplement at or or h after birth .
the maximum applied temperature was c and the pressure was - 8 mbar .,the required time for powdering l of colostrum was h .
they were separated from dams immediately after receiving first colostrum and were kept in individual calf pens .,alfalfa hay and concentrates were added to daily feeding at days after birth .
"in addition , weight of calves at the age of month was measured .","the incidence of diarrhea , consistency of feces , and concurrent disease with diarrhea was evaluated through the first days after birth ."
"calves were classified into four groups related to the interval of birth and diarrhea occurrence : - 7 , - 14 , - 21 , and - 30 days .","on the basis of the interval of birth and diarrhea incidence , there was no significant difference between the colostrum - type groups ( table ) ."
further research is needed to determine any relationship between lyophilized colostrum supplement feeding and igg and solids in the supplement and igg absorption .,the major criticism of this study was the inability to measure igg levels of the calves on the day of birth and at days of age .
"the goal of this collaboration has been to enable the countries of the region to collect good quality surveillance data on influenza and influenza - associated illnesses in a timely and reliable manner , use these data to improve understanding of the burden , seasonality and risk factors of influenza in the region , and use such evidence to introduce control measures such as influenza vaccines to reduce the incidence of severe disease and death attributed to influenza .",this successful collaboration has led to substantial improvements in influenza surveillance in the region and the use of data for public health .
"the fourth meeting of the emaris network was held in amman , jordan from to december .","at the recommendation of the third meeting , the first scientific conference on acute respiratory infection in the eastern mediterranean region was held in conjunction with the fourth emaris meeting ."
"the meeting was attended by representatives from all countries of the region , the global health development , cdc , who headquarters , as well as participants from selected universities and academic institutions and over young researchers who presented abstracts to the conference .",this report provides an overview of the outcomes of the meeting and conference .
"since its establishment in , the gisrs network has provided early warning of changes in influenza viruses circulating in the global population through timely sharing of influenza viruses and surveillance data .",it has also helped mitigate the consequences of pandemic influenza and maintained the efficacy of seasonal influenza vaccines .
"because of this global surveillance , a recent study suggests that seasonal influenza continues to be an acute health burden for young and old people every year around the world resulting in an estimated - 645 respiratory deaths ( 4.0 - 8.8 per individuals ) annually .","faced with pandemic threats from highly pathogenic zoonotic infections from different influenza a subtypes , the gisrs continues to be an ideal platform for global collaboration to forestall and respond to public health emergencies ."
the primary objective of this project was to determine seasonality of rsv estimate the burden of rsv - associated hospitalization and provide evidence for introduction of vaccines through informed public health decisions .,"in , the global influenza programme of who launched a two year pilot project on respiratory synctial virus ( rsv ) surveillance using the gisrs platform which was participated by countries across all six who regions ."
"in response to the report of the review committee on the functioning of the international health regulations and on pandemic influenza ( h1n1 ) , who developed the pandemic influenza severity assessment ( pisa ) that can assess and measure the severity of every influenza epidemic , whether seasonal or pandemic .","in march , the pisa approach was launched officially after piloting between and ."
"the framework establishes a pip benefit - sharing system that includes an annual partnership contribution to who from manufacturers of influenza vaccines , diagnostics and pharmaceuticals that use the gisrs .",the pip framework for sharing influenza viruses and access to vaccines and other benefits is an international arrangement to improve global pandemic influenza preparedness and response .
the seasonality and epidemiology of influenza are now better understood in different influenza transmission zones of the region .,more countries are using the evidence generated to consider introducing and increasing the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccines and other cost - effective interventions to control influenza .
acute respiratory infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people affected by crises .,"for example , acute lower respiratory infections accounted for about % of visits to outpatient services and % of reported deaths in refugee camps in kenya and thailand during - 2011 ."
an important function of the centres is to share seasonal influenza viruses with the who collaborating centres for vaccine strain selection .,"the capacity of these centres , especially the viral sequencing capacity , has been critical for determining genetic changes in the seasonal influenza virus and for identifying new influenza strains or subtypes ."
analysis of the number of vaccine doses distributed in the countries confirmed the low vaccination coverage rates .,"desirable coverage for some atrisk groups , such as healthcare workers and pilgrims , was achieved in few countries ."
"a review of literature published between and in the region on influenza vaccine policies , use , recommendations and coverage reveal wide variation in influenza vaccination rates among healthcare workers and other high risk groups within and between the countries from less than % in pakistan to as high as % in qatar .","similarly , data on vaccination rates among pregnant women showed wide variation from as low as % in a study from pakistan to about % in saudi arabia ."
"recently , several countries of the region reported the newly emerged a ( h5n8 ) virus in wild birds and poultry .","in addition , a ( h9n2 ) viruses are endemic in several regional countries , and sero - epidemiological studies have found evidence of a ( h9n2 ) antibodies in humans ."
a systematic review was also done to gather information on one health before developing a framework to enhance surveillance and better data collection at the humananimal interface .,"in light of this , and drawing on egypt ' s eerience with avian influenza a ( h5n1 ) outbreaks , the regional office drafted a one health framework for action to tackle spill overs of animal influenza viruses to humans and to detect early , prevent and control newly emerged zoonotic influenza ."
the countries used the existing surveillance platform for severe acute respiratory infections and identified the highest number of influenza - positive cases in children between and months of age whereas the highest number of cases positive for respiratory syncytial virus were in children between and months .,studies have been conducted in several countries to better understand the burden and epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus in the region and its importance as a cause of acute lower respiratory infections in children under five years .
a summary of these challenges identified in the plenary discussions are shown in box .,"because of the constant evolution of influenza viruses , and the limitations in knowledge and control measures , two essential elements of surveillance and response to influenza are collecting good quality data year round and testing samples using a systematic sampling strategy ."
"the year marks the th anniversary of the greatest influenza pandemic in history , the "" spanish flu "" .","since then , three influenza pandemics have occurred ( 1957 , and ) , and future pandemics appear inevitable ."
the foundation for this exists box : challenges to improving and sustaining the influenza surveillance system in the eastern mediterranean region,"as we cannot predict influenza pandemics and new infectious disease threats such as mers , effective respiratory disease surveillance for early warning , together with strong preparedness measures , are essential ."
the virological and epidemiological components are often not integrated into the sari / ili surveillance system and are not part of the national routine disease surveillance and reporting system ( often the sari / ili surveillance system is considered a stand - alone vertical system which is fund - driven ) .,clinicians are often unaware of the need to use consistent and systematic surveillance case definitions for severe acute respiratory infection / influenza - like illness ( sari / ili ) and to enrol only cases meeting the case definitions .
the absence or inadequacy of appropriate diagnostic facilities to define the viral etiology of severe pneumonia is a problem and means that many acute lower respiratory infections are undiagnosed and hence that viral pneumonia incidence rates are underestimated .,annual projections of the requirements for reagents and consumable laboratory supplies for the detection and diagnosis of seasonal influenza and other respiratory viruses based on a well - defined sampling strategy are often lacking .
sustain the existing platform for influenza surveillance in order to detect and monitor threats from new and emerging respiratory viruses .,make available good quality data and a common stock of diagnostic kits and reagents .
"this is due , in part , to the ever increasing and well connected human population and the global eansion of domestic poultry and pig populations .",the number of reported novel influenza a virus infections in humans has increased over - fold in the past years .
"as an influenza pandemic is an unpredictable but recurring event that can have serious consequences on human health and economic security worldwide , advanced planning and preparedness are critical to help mitigate the effect of a pandemic .",the lessons from the influenza a ( h1n1 ) pandemic emphasized the need for risk - based and integrated approaches in pan - demic preparedness and harmonized national and international preparedness and response efforts .
"the conference with the theme "" better understanding , better preparedness , and better response "" provided a forum for young health researchers and health professionals in the public , semipublic and private sectors throughout the region to present their research findings on influenza surveillance , laboratory detection , outbreak detection and response , acute respiratory infection , collaboration at the animal - human interface , vaccination for influenza and pneumonia , and pandemic preparedness and response .","a total of abstracts were presented , orally and as posters ."
emphasis should be placed on : improving the quality of data collection and systematic analysis ; promoting timely and complete public reporting of data ; and enhancing prompt virus sharing to avoid vaccine mismatch .,"the quality of the influenza surveillance system should be evaluated regularly using a standardized approach in order to improve data quality , analysis and influenza sampling ."
surveillance data should also be used to monitor the effectiveness of control programmes or interventions in reducing deaths and disabilities from influenza and influenza - associated illness .,"collaboration between scientific communities , academia and the public sector on the use of such data for informed decision - making would contribute to capacity building ."
greater use should be made of the flunet and emflu platforms for timely influenza data reporting .,national influenza centres should build and maintain sequencing capacity for both seasonal influenza and other non - influenza respiratory viruses .
"in countries with low vaccine uptake and in general , a case should be developed for economic investment in seasonal influenza vaccination highlighting the saving in healthcare cost that can be made as a result of the substantial decrease in influenza incidence through yearly vaccination .",vaccination against seasonal influenza should be recognized as part of pandemic influenza preparedness .
"the public health response to zoonotic influenza will rely on joint surveillance , investigation and laboratory detection under the one health framework",detection of and response to zoonotic influenza with epidemic potential can be improved by enhancing surveillance at the humananimal interface including periodic information sharing and joint risk assessment between the animal and human health sectors .
"national influenza centres should build capacities to detect non - influenza respiratory viruses , especially for molecular detection of respiratory syncytial virus and sequencing of genotypes .",surveillance for respiratory syncytial virus should be piloted using the same sentinel - based surveillance platforms used for severe acute respiratory infection .
the national pandemic influenza preparedness plan should be updated and reviewed using who ' s planning guidance and checklists .,planning for pandemic influenza preparedness should be considered in the context of strengthening the core capacity of the international health regulations and should be a part of national action plan for health security .
"panellists comprised ministry of health officials managing the influenza programme in their countries , academia , scientists and who staff who discussed ways to sustain the influenza programmes , the value of improving the system to better manage other health security threats , and how to improve the use of surveillance data for influenza control strategies and monitor the effectiveness of control intervention ( box ) .",seven panel discussions were held on a broad range of topics .
"the emergence of mers - cov in the region in is a reminder that new respiratory viruses will continue to appear and are risks to national , regional and global health security .","the continued circulation of mers - cov and avian influenza highlight the need to further improve the surveillance system for severe acute respiratory infection in order to track , detect , identify and monitor viruses which continue to evolve and change ."
"a vision for the future would be to sustain the quality and effectiveness of epidemiological and virological surveillance systems for influenza in the region , including timely sharing of data for public reporting and better use of surveillance data .",establishing such an evidence base is necessary to make informed policy decisions to improve preparedness for and response to influenza epidemics or pandemics .
the loss of egfp eression ( d5a ibv ) was also accompanied by reversion to growth kinetics resembling the standard virus and intact recombinant virus .,"direct sequencing of rt - pcr products derived from cells infected with the plaque - purified virus , which had lost eression of egfp , confirmed loss of the egfp orf ."
"two thirds of the coronavirus genome encodes the replicase activity , including a viral rna - dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) , helicase , and viral proteinases .","coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with positive sense , vcapped and vpolyadenylated rna genomes , that range from to kb ( lai and cavanagh , ) ."
"n proteins , which interact with viral genomic rna , forming ribonucleocapsid ( rnp ) complexes , have been associated with replication and transcription ( baric et al . , ; compton et al . , ; robbins et al . , ) .","the e and m proteins are localized in er - golgi intermediate compartment and play critical roles in viral budding ( de haan et al . , ; fischer et al . , ) ."
"although the functions of the four ibv group - specific orf , a , b , a , and b are not known , a vero cell passaged ibv mutant with a truncated b was viable in vitro and in vivo ( shen et al . , ) .","functions of these genes are not well understood , however , deletion of combinations of several group - specific genes in mhv resulted in in vivo attenuation ( de haan et al . , ) ."
amplified the viral genome into several fragments by rt - pcr and the cloned amplicons were ligated through unique restriction sites for in vitro assembly of the entire genome .,"this strategy was further modified to construct an infectious cdna clone of mhv with their bno see ' mq technology , in which restriction endonuclease sequences were incorporated into amplicons , such that upon enzyme treatment , the endonuclease sites were eliminated prior to in vitro ligation ."
we further have demonstrated that the a orf can be eliminated or replaced by the egfp orf while maintaining virus viability .,"in the current study , molecular clones of ibv were generated using the in vitro assembly of cdna fragments as a template for transcription of full - length genomic rna ."
"in order to determine the consensus sequence of the genome , two to five independent clones of each amplicon were sequenced using a panel of internal primers .",clones with consensus sequences were used for in vitro assembly of full - length cdna template .
the final transcript product was verified by northern blot analysis using a probe against v utr ( data not shown ) .,any transcript of a size comparable to viral genomic rna with a detectable vutr presumably contained the entire genome of ibv because only the a fragment had a t7 rna promoter and thus could initiate transcription .
"the a orf was used rather than the a , b region which contains an internal ribosomal entry site ( ires ) needed for eression of the essential structural , e protein ( le et al . , ) .","the egfp orf was used to replace the a orf , beginning at the start codon , while the v end of a orf , that included the stop codon , was kept intact because this region overlaps with the b orf ."
these three pcr products were cloned into the pstblue cloning vector and the inserts were excised from the vectors with the bsmbi restriction enzyme .,"b , lane ) , were pcr amplified using primers that incorporated the bsmbi restriction enzyme recognition sequence ( table ) ."
"interestingly , some cells eressed egfp before even showing virus infection induced morphological changes .","following nucleotide sequencing analysis , it was confirmed that no unintentional mutations were incorporated into the amplicons used to construct the recombinant gibv ."
"in this study , we constructed an infectious cdna clone of ibv and recombinant ibv eressing egfp instead of a protein , using in vitro assembly which is less labor intensive and allows for easy manipulation , such as the introduction of targeted mutations .","molecular clones of several coronaviruses have been constructed using three different methodologies , vaccinia virus vectors and bac as cloning systems , and the in vitro assembly strategy ."
"however , it has been shown that these small orf , including a , are conserved among the various strains of ibv ( brooks et al . , ) .","based on studies with mhv and tgev , in which deletion of multiple group - specific genes resulted in attenuation of virulence , group - specific genes of ibv are reasonable candidates for viral attenuation and foreign gene replacement ( de haan et al . , ; sola et al . , ) ."
"it has been assumed that gene b is eressed by leaky scanning mechanism ( liu and inglis , ) .",the egfp orf contained an appropriate kozak sequence and may have reduced the eression of b .
it is not clear whether the foreign gene itself or its specific location in the viral genome causes this spontaneous deletion event .,"furthermore , we cannot conclude whether deletion of the egfp gene , under the control of the a trs , is a general phenomenon of recombinant ibv or a result of egfp toxicity ."
italicized nucleotides and the positions starred below the sequence alignment represent conserved sequences .,every mutant lost the egfp start codon but maintained the b start codon ( underlined ) .
"pcr amplification of cdna fragments was performed using the following conditions ; denaturation at c for min , cycles at c for s , c for s , and c for - 6 min depending on the size of the fragment and cycles of c for s , c for s , and c for - 6 min ( with an additional s for each subsequent cycle ) .","the pcr products were isolated from agarose gels and cloned into pcr - xl - topo ( invitrogen ) or psmart ( lucigen , middleton , wi ) vectors , according to the manufacturer ' s directions ."
two to four independent clones of each amplicon were isolated and sequenced by using specific primers and the abi dye termination sequencing method .,"a consensus sequence was determined by comparison of direct pcr product sequencing from each independent clone and amplicons , encoding the consensus sequence of each region of ibv , were cloned using standard recombinant dna techniques ( sambrook et al . , ) ."
"the in vitro transcription reaction was performed at c for h in al reaction mixtures , supplemented with al of mm gtp , resulting in a : 1 ratio of gtp to capping analog .",a similar reaction was performed for the n transcript using a ratio of gtp and capping analog .

"in this patients ' setting , the psychological structure often represents a "" baggage "" during their oncological treatments , which are "" life - saving "" and cannot be postponed .","receiving diagnosis of cancer leads the establishment of several psychological dynamics : fear of dying , uncertainty , loss of control , change in interpersonal relationships and self - image ."
"in the present context , sars - cov - 2 infection has a significant impact on everyone ' s daily life , due to some recommendations to reduce its spread ( wash your hands , avoid contact with other people , keep a distance , remain at home ) .",these latter recommendations could have a negative impact on the life of oncological patients .
the sense of loneliness affects all oncological patients and this feeling reduces compliance to lifesaving treatments for fear of infection losing sight of the importance of care .,"on the other hand , it is important not to underestimate the dependence that patients can develop towards the following therapeutic plan ."

"other patients report fear of being touched , while being carefully positioned on the treatment table .","most patients , during rt , reported feeling of protection by the physician , the radiotherapist , the nurse who wears gloves and masks : "" someone takes care of me concretely "" in this society where trusting , for some people , is eerienced as difficult ."

"in this regard , some lectins produced by algae and cyanobacteria are notable for their high antiviral activity against hiv , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) coronavirus and zaire ebola virus .","in general , those proteins act by preventing the fusion of the virus with the host cell through binding to viral glycoproteins ."
"interestingly , the domains are nearly identical but differ in their affinities for carbohydrates .","with the aim of enhancing understanding of the binding properties of scytovirin , we performed molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of scytovirin complexed with man4 ."
"therefore , it is very important to know all the structural aspects of the interaction of scytovirin with the high - mannose arrays in order to develop an effective microbicide .","however , it has been demonstrated that hiv can develop resistance to hiv by deglycosylation in site - specific residues , although multiple mutations are necessary to make this happen ."

"building on existing research into biosecurity and the spread of infectious disease via the global airline network , this paper elores the biopolitics of public health in the uk through an in - depth empirical analysis of the representation of h1n1 in uk national and regional newspapers .",we uncover new discourses relating to the significance of the airport as a site for control and the ethics of the treatment of the traveller as a potential transmitter of disease .

"indeed , she likened the transmission of influenza pandemics to a ' tidal wave ' - something that cannot be realistically contained by travel restrictions .","this natural disaster metaphor , frequently employed in sections of the media to conceptualise immigration ( charteris - black , , p . ) , was used in this context to illustrate how the virus can sweep through densely populated areas , leading to a steep increase in cases ( ' with a sharp peak ' ) , followed by a rapid decline ( who , a ) ."
"moreover , we identify the importance of place in the context of emerging infectious disease .","in this paper , we adopt a more qualitative approach , considering the messages broadcast by the uk print media in relation to the h1n1 pandemic ."
"during summer , the uk eerienced one of the highest incidences of h1n1 transmission outside of the americas and australia ( ecdc , the associated growth in international services at uk regional airports opened up a number of places through which infectious disease could enter the country .","it is widely believed that the h1n1 influenza virus arrived in the uk not via london heathrow or gatwick ( the traditional entry points for all the uk ' s long - haul airline traffic ) but on a direct charter flight from canc n , mexico to birmingham international airport ( bia ) in the west midlands ."
"the broadcast media acts as an important ' validator ' of scientific information , with reporters and editors making continual judgements on whose voice is heard and how that voice is represented ( gamson , ; see also brown et al . , forthcoming ) .","broadsheet titles perform a key agenda - setting function , often being ' preferred by politicians and other decision - makers ' ( carvalho , , p . ) ."
"much of the rhetoric employed in this discourse has its origins in security policy research , where a distinction is drawn between the ' outside ' , deemed to be dangerous , and the ' inside ' , which is ' locked down tightly , secured and safe ' ( nerlich et al . , , p . ; see also , wallis and nerlich , ; chilton , ) .","in this perspective , rooted in cold war literature on ' containment ' , a ' unitary state actor ' provides the interface between the inside and outside ( chilton , : ) ."
"collier and lakoff , in their analysis of ' biosecurity interventions ' enacted in response to emerging pathogenic threats , concluded that disputes surrounding the costs and benefits of such initiatives are in part about the ' politics of risk ' , requiring :","of particular relevance to this paper are the discourses surrounding the targeting of potential health risks ( braun , ; bingham et al . , ; collier and lakoff , ) ."
"instead , it has been suggested that the most appropriate solutions lie in a combination of national public health interventions to reduce local transmission of the virus and the international development and stockpiling of vaccines to compensate for for example , the authors refer to who protocols on the cull of domestic poultry in cairo to safeguard against the spread of h5n1 - a measure that disproportionately affected the poor ( refer also , hinchliffe and bingham , ) .","in consequence , a general consensus is emerging that restrictions on air travel are likely to be of limited value in delaying epidemics ( cooper et al . , ; who , a ) ."
"for the most part , this work has focused on screening against terrorism rather than disease ( adey , ( adey , , amoore and hall , ) and on the practices of major airports overseas ( salter , ; bennett , ; lahav , ) .","yet , in the last two decades , its role as a place of control , has assumed greater importance , with the liberalisation of the uk aviation sector multiplying the points of entry for ' etic ' diseases and placing the regions at the borders ."
"these include the complexities of managing risk at various scales - international , national and regional - and the role of the airport as a site for controlling the threat of disease spread .","when we merge the literatures on biosecurity and spread of disease , questions arise about ' containment ' and the traveller ' s journey ."
"media analyses have been employed by scholars to examine interpretative inventories ( for example , metaphors , symbolic dates , scare statistics ) in the reporting of earlier , and in some cases ongoing , disease outbreaks such as sars , avian influenza and foot and mouth disease ( larson et al . , ; nerlich and halliday , ; nerlich et al . , ) .","in her wide - ranging study of risk and the ' other ' , joffe highlighted the role of the mass media in , firstly , ' relaying ' scientific interpretations of new phenomena and , secondly , facilitating dialogues between individual members of the public ' in pubs , on buses and around dinner tables ' ( 1999 , p . ) ."
"firstly , we observe that the discourse describing international disease spread and biosecurity practices employed at overseas airports became increasingly critical in relation to measures taken against uk travellers .","secondly , we draw attention to contrasts between national and regional press reporting of biosecurity practices within uk borders ."
"the period searched was from april , when the uk press first reported this story , to september , when the first purported pandemic ' wave ' had subsided .","our analysis of newspaper reports utilised the online newspaper archive , nexis uk , to identify all articles referring either to ' h1n1 ' or its earlier appellation - ' swine flu ' - anywhere in the text ."
"gives an indication of frequency of reporting on the virus during this period , whilst fig .",details the rates of influenza - like illness ( ili ) in ( i ) england and wales and ( ii ) scotland during this timeframe .
"indeed , newspaper reporting during first weeks accounted for over % of the total coverage on the disease throughout the timeframe .","following a single mention in the northern echo on april , interest in the h1n1 virus surged , in both the national and regional press ."
"other locations reporting widely included belfast ( belfast evening telegraph ) , newcastle ( the journal ) and london ( evening standard ) .","the virus was given particularly prominent coverage in the initial hotspots in and around birmingham ( birmingham evening mail , birmingham post , coventry evening telegraph ) and in parts of scotland ( the herald , scotsman and scotsman on sunday ) ."
this outbreak was ' particularly worrisome ' according to one quoted eert because the deaths had happened in at least four different regions of mexico and because ' the victims had not been vulnerable infants and the elderly ' .,"over the following week , a number of articles appeared in the national uk press detailing the rapidity of the international spread of the ' new ' disease - a new strain of influenza - emphasising the challenges in attempting to contain it and drawing comparisons with previous influenza pandemics , which had also first struck in healthy young adults ."
"the daily telegraph , relayed the who position on the futility of sovereign states issuing travel advisories , recounting that ' borders ' cannot halt swine flu ' ' ( 29 april ) .","the mirror reported that medical staff in mexico had ' struggled to contain ' the disease , resulting in fears that it could ' sweep rapidly across the globe ' ( 27 april ) , whilst the times stated that public authorities ' from every corner of the world ' were ' scrambling ' to contain the virus ( 27 april ) ."
"although the uk press did not elicitly lobby for any of these approaches , their reports allowed comparisons to be drawn with the less formal measures being employed across the country .","many of the measures focussed on the airport , and included : ' reinforced checks ' for visitors from affected countries ( for example , by the authorities in france ) ; provision of additional medical staff ( australia ) ; use of thermal imaging scanners ( for example , bulgaria , australia , singapore , philippines , and indonesia ) ; planned detention / quarantining of passengers suspected of carrying h1n1 ( for example , singapore , vietnam , australia , china , russia , taiwan , and bolivia ) ; and powers to ' disinfect ' suspected passengers ( australia ) ( examples extracted from : the times , april ; the mirror , april ; the guardian , april ) ."
"one of this paper ' s reviewers advised us to clarify that all influenza viruses , especially the h - antigen influenza viruses , have the ability to either mutate or to genetically reassert their antigens .","this occurs , firstly , with zoonotic influenza a strains , and then , secondly , with human strains ."
"a few days later , the manchester evening news reported on the detention of a uk - based traveller ( ' my hell locked up in egypt swine flu ward ' ) who was subsequently found not to have the virus ( 30 july ) .","australia abandoned additional thermal screening at its borders for visitors , ostensibly due to its eense and stated ineffectiveness ( daily mail , july ; see also ron , ) ."
"quarantine officers , dressed in surgical masks , gloves and medical suits , greet passengers once the plane has docked and file silently down the aisles , placing a temperature gun at the forehead of each passenger .","anyone with a temperature even slightly above normal is singled out , removed from the plane and taken to hospital by ambulance for further tests ( daily mail , july ) ."
"the practices of a country , which has not been seen to hold human rights in high regard , were both a source of fascination and a source of dread , with anonymous quarantine officers portrayed as stealthily checking the temperature of each passenger , ' singl [ ing ] out ' and ' remov [ ing ] ' those that deviate from an eected norm .","whilst the article does eress some approval for the albeit ' strict ' measures , stating that they ' appear to be working ' and citing the very low number of cases and no deaths among a population of billion , its imagery forms part of a thread drawing attention to the strangeness of screening practices conducted ' over there ' at the height of uk reporting on h1n1 ."
"in the regional press , by contrast , there was a sense of urgency ; a need for the uk public authorities to do more to prevent further virus transmission .","at this scale , the global processes and events outlined above were translated into locally relevant stories , and it is worth briefly considering the impact of the global political economy on localised disease management and biosecurity ."
"a spokeswoman for manchester airport , defending this approach , was reported as stating that travellers were only being screened at heathrow because flights landed there from mexico city , the then centre of the outbreak ( belfast telegraph , april ; see also the scotsman , april ) .","at heathrow and gatwick airports , health officials and clinicians were reported as being more pro - active , boarding aircraft arriving from mexico , asking passengers questions and checking them for symptoms of the disease ( the guardian , april ; the eress , april ; the mirror , april ) ."
"to finish our analysis , we turn to stories that focus on a more intimate scale - that of the individual traveller .",articles in both national and regional press indicated that practices employed at such sites were ' ad hoc ' in comparison to those at major city nodes such as london heathrow and london gatwick .
"see also : daily telegraph , july daily mail , july ; the guardian , july ; the times , july ) .","on july , the sunday times was one among many newspapers to report that check - in staff at heathrow and ' other main british airports ' were ' vetting passengers ' for possible h1n1 symptoms ( 19 july ."
"in early july , it was reported that a group of nottingham university medical students - having unknowingly contracted the virus in the uk - had unintentionally transferred h1n1 to kenya , whilst travelling with charity assisting kenyan orphans ( nottingham evening post , july , july , july ; the independent , july ; the guardian , july ) .","one month later , in a short article for the observer , professor robert dingwall of nottingham university drew attention to the potential for the uk traveller , in particular gap year students working on developmental projects , to infect a population that may not be able to access antiviral medication and was more likely to suffer from severe underlying health conditions , such as tuberculosis ( tb ) ."
"staying at home this year will often be the morally right thing to do ( the observer , august ) .","while travel bans may not be justifiable , uk travellers cannot avoid thinking about their personal ethical responsibilities to the people of the countries that they are visiting ."
"as suggested above , this inverts much existing literature in this area with its more fearful evocation of the disease - carrying ' other ' infecting the social body ( charteris - black , , p . ; joffe , ; cresswell , ; kraut , ) .","in both the above representations , the outward traveller was being depicted as someone who ought to practice control over his / her body , managing the risk it posed to the less advantaged ' other ' ."
this paper develops the scholarly literature on pathologies of travel by considering uk media representations of the first ' wave ' of spread of the h1n1 virus .,the analysis has been conducted with reference to questions about containment and the traveller ' s journey .
it is a place where operations of containment were enacted and biosecurity interventions performed .,"in our analysis , the airport assumes an important role as a site for the operation of various practices of control , ranging from completion of questionnaires to checking passenger body temperature using thermal imaging technology ."
"on the one hand , there was a key role played by the airport as ' censor ' and a point at which the threat posed by the atrisk ' other ' could be minimised .",central to the media reporting were ethical questions relating to the traveller and the airport .
"finally , mechanisms of transmission from inanimate surfaces to patients are highlighted .",particular emphasis is laid on the current knowledge of the survival time and conditions favouring survival of the pathogens .
"as a result , surface disinfection is indicated in the following situations :","within the multi - barrier strategy of the prevention of hai , environmental disinfection policies should be based on risk assessments for surfaces with different risks for cross contamination such as high - and low - touched surfaces with appropriate standards for adequate disinfection measures under consideration of the persistence and infectious dose of the pathogens ."
"in healthcare settings , however , contaminated surfaces , which may not always be optimal for microbial survival and multiplication , still may play a role in the chain of infection , since surfaces close to the patients ' environment may be touched at high frequencies , allowing transmission from animated sources to others via contaminated inanimate surfaces .","microorganisms may be transmitted from animated sources to inanimate environmental sources , which may become secondary reservoirs if they meet the needs of transmitted pathogens to survive and to multiply ."
"furthermore , such knowledge will also assist ensuring the biosafety in microbiological and biomedical laboratories , food - handling settings , and for hygienic behaviour in the everyday life to prevent transmission of infectious diseases .","because of this , the knowledge on the survival of bacteria , fungi , viruses and protozoa on surfaces , and hence , in a broader sense , in the human environment , is important for planning and implementing tactics for prevention of healthcare - acquired infections ( hai ) ."
"both viruses are airborne transmitted infectious agents , however , they may also be transmitted via hand - surface contacts , supporting the relevance of hand hygiene and personal protection against infection .","this virus retains infectivity on different substrates up to days , as compared to the influenza virus , which demonstrates a relatively long persistence in the environment up to weeks ."
"because of a number of microorganisms ' ability to persist and survive for longterm periods on surfaces , particularly in healthcare settings , the usage of antimicrobially impregnated surfaces is increasingly discussed .","however , because of the required long contact times of microorganisms on antimicrobial surfaces , such technologies may be useful for surfaces with low frequency of hand contacts ."
the level of microbial bio - burden on surface in healthcare settings is low compared to the numbers on patients ' skin or in faeces .,"however , even at low particle numbers there is a risk of transmission ( table . 1 ) ."
the importance of surface contamination is also shown by reduction in the rate of hai when effective measures of environmental disinfection are implemented .,a recent observational study showed a significant reduction in c . difficile infection rates following the introduction of sporicidal wipes in an environmental cleaning regimen in an acute london trust .
"the longer a microorganism may persist on a surface , the longer the contaminated surface may be a source of transmission and thus endanger a susceptible patient or healthcare worker of becoming the target of infection .","in order to estimate the risk of cross contamination , kramer et al ."
"have analysed the persistence of various gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria including e . coli , s . aureus , p . aeruginosa , and enterococcus hirae on office paper after contamination with standardised inocula of bacterial suspensions in the range of cfu / ml .","because paper still is omnipresent in healthcare settings worldwide today , h bner et al ."
"most viruses from the respiratory tract such as corona - , coackie - , or influenza virus , sars , or rhinovirus can persist on surfaces","in order to estimate the persistence of viruses on inanimate surfaces , usually cell culture media are prepared ."
"candida albicans , the most important nosocomial yeast , can survive up to months on surfaces .",persistence of other yeasts was described to be similar ( torulopsis glabrata : months ) or shorter ( candida parapsilosis : days ) ( table . 4 ) .
"an important habitat and vector for infection are hydrogel contact lenses , resulting in contact lens associated keratitis caused by acanthamoeba and fusarium , particularly since the contact lenses ' moist condition supports survival protozoa .","acanthamoeba are one of the most common protozoa in soil , and frequently found in fresh water and other environmental habitats ."
"because of a lipid double - layer structure with a thin peptidoglycan ( murein ) layer consisting of alternating residues of - n - acetylglucosamine and n - acetylmuramic acid , the later are not so well protected against physical stress and need higher rh in order to survive .","the reason for this bacterial behaviour is the design of bacterial cell wall , which allows gram - positive organisms to tolerate dry conditions better than gram - negative organisms ."
"indeed , temperature is an important factor influencing the survival of a number of viruses .",the viral genome ( viral dna or rna ) is sensitive to the surrounding temperature .
"for most viruses , such as astrovirus , adenovirus , poliovirus , herpes simplex virus , and hepatitis a virus , low temperature is associated with a longer persistence .",constant temperatures > 24 c appear universally to decrease airborne bacterial survival .
"the persistence on inanimate surfaces is prolonged and depends of the environmental conditions , especially the humidity .","also on hospital surfaces biofilms were demonstrated on a number of objects and surfaces , such as sterile supply buckets , opaque plastic doors , venetian blind cords , and sink rubbers , and it was possible to cultivate viable bacteria ."
"some authors described that the type of material did not affect the persistence of echovirus , adenovirus , para - influenza virus , rotavirus , respiratory syncytial virus , poliovirus , or norovirus .","however , inconsistent results are reported for the influence of type of materials on microbial survival ."
"during outbreaks , the role of the patients ' environment is particularly evident , as suggested by observed evidence for acinetobacter baumannii , c . difficile , mrsa , p . aeruginosa , vre , adenovirus , sars virus , rotavirus , and norovirus .","due to the overwhelming evidence of low compliance of hand disinfection , the risk from contaminated surfaces cannot be overlooked and must not be down played by hospital administrations ."
the purpose of preventive or targeted disinfection on inanimate surfaces is the killing or irreversible inactivation of pathogens to an extent which prevents subsequent infection transmission .,"in order to ensure the success of environmental disinfection , education , training , and targeted microbiological control are important measures and have been shown to improve both , cleaning performance and infection prevention ."
results revealed that the most important characteristics of health / medical institutions spokespersons are professional competence and good interaction with the media .,"in contrast , the most important behaviors they should avoid are concealing the truth and misreporting the truth ."
the selection of a credible spokesperson facilitates effective information dissemination as the public receive information from diverse sources during the uncertain and chaotic situation of a health crisis .,", 1 3 e15 as indicated by covello , the six components of best practice in public health risk and crisis communication plan include having stakeholders as partners , listening to people ' s voices , being honest and open , collaborating with credible sources , meeting the media ' s needs , and communicating clearly ."
"research on effective crisis communication merits further discussion of the performance of public health officials as spokespersons in response to a newly emerging infectious disease , e . g . , the influence of the public ' s compliance on self - protection action and quarantine practice .","the purpose of this study was to elore the performance and characteristics of spokespersons from health agencies and medical institutions in response to the sars outbreak , in terms of what they should not do during such a health emergency , or what they must do to make their presentation more effective ."
"a purposive sampling strategy was used to recruit potential participants from various backgrounds to reflect a diversity of viewpoints , rather than population - based statistically representative samples .",this study employed qualitative research methods by using semi - structured in - depth interviews .
"in addition , to enhance the recall of the sars epidemic , a list was made of "" taiwan sars epidemic major news events "" according to data from taiwan centers for disease control and taiwan central news agency and presented it to the interviewees .","informed consent was obtained from all interviewees before conducting the interviews , and several essential issues were elained to them , including the voluntary nature and the purpose of the study , why and how the interviewee had been chosen , eected duration of the interview , how the information would be kept confidential , and the use of an audio recording device and the taking of backup field notes of the interview process ."
"the major interview questions in this study were : "" generally speaking , how would you evaluate the performance of the spokespersons ?",""" , "" what are the essential / positive characteristics of a spokesperson that you observed or eected ?"
"even if you included those keywords they [ spokespersons ] mentioned , the headline might not be understandable .",""" we need to condense the news headline within characters [ words ] according to the major content of a news story ."
"because the public are already in a panic , if the spokesperson is less knowledgeable than you , or you feel he is incorrect , by using common sense to make a judgment .",or at least have a moderate level of professional knowledge in the relevant field .
"from the media advisor interviewees ' observation , the spokespersons failed to use accurate words and disseminate consistent information .","also , some could not accept the fact that certain spokespersons were easily angered ( j7 ) and / or threatening media reporters ( j4 ) , and spoke in a bureaucratic style ( j1 ) ."
"if the spokesperson disseminated an inaccurate message , the impact would be very large .",some interviewees from health departments and medical institutions mentioned the importance and necessity of assigning a spokesperson for crisis communication .
"interviewees from the medical institutions emphasized that the spokesperson should have sufficient professional knowledge , yet the interviewees from the health departments also emphasized knowledge regarding media interaction .","furthermore , whether having a moderate degree of professional knowledge instead of eert knowledge , they should be considered as competent , especially when facing the uncertainty of newly emerging infectious diseases ."
"no credibility , poor emotional control and improper demeanor were spokespersons ' taboos when interacting with the media .","in contrast , the taboo / negative characteristics of spokespersons included : inappropriate demeanor , lack of honesty / sincerity , having poor emotional control , having a political position / political bias , and having a bureaucratic style ."
the eectation of spokespersons ' characteristics varied because of the different backgrounds of the interviewees .,"from the perspective of media reporters , media advisors , and social observers , the spokespersons of health departments and medical institutions should have professional knowledge , a good understanding of the media landscape , and be open and credible . """
"some interviewees from health departments thought that the spokespersons should maintain good relations with the media , possess good media interaction skills , and understand what the media needs .","it was found that they regarded spokesperson as an important role , and paid considerable attention to the importance of media relations ."
"second , some of the favored characteristics that were perceived by the interviewees ( e . g . , knowledgeable and credible ) were similar to those suggested in the who handbook for effective media communication during public health emergencies .","first , the spokespersons had poor interaction with the media , and their performance was unsatisfactory ."
"several possible elanations for these conflicts included poor understanding of the media landscape and its needs , the inconsistency of information dissemination , and unfavorable characteristics of the spokespeople .",the conflicts during the interview process with the spokespeople were also mentioned by the interviewees .
"for example , regarding sars case statistics , reports announced at different points in time caused much confusion in the television news and print media .","however , discrepancies between national and regional health departments , and multiple spokespersons within the same agencies may influence the consistency of the information provided ."
"this may be due to the fact that sars is a rare and unique health catastrophe , and no other country had the same level of fear or high - density of media eure as taiwan .","it is also important to note that even after performing an extensive literature search for similar studies , we were unable to locate a single study related to spokespersons ."
"despite these limitations , this study provided data on the perception of traits of spokespersons and criteria useful in selecting public health officials and hospital managers as spokespersons in sars crisis communication .","we therefore provided a "" 2003 taiwan sars news events list "" to help interviewees recall the sars event ."
the recent pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) coronavirus illustrated not only how a newly evolved pathogen can rapidly spread throughout the world but also how the global community can unite to identify the causative agent and control its spread .,"rapid response research mechanisms , such as those used by the sars accelerated vaccine initiative ( savi ) , have shown that the application of emergency management techniques , together with rapid response research , can be highly effective when applied appropriately to new infectious diseases ."
pandemics and epidemics have been commonplace as the density of the world ' s population and international travel and trade have increased to support the global spread of pathogens .,"microbial pathogens are constantly evolving , and new pathogens are continually emerging from nature ."
"however , despite the acquisition of this large body of scientific information , as sars was spreading around the world a method of controlling the virus was required in case it escaped containment measures .",this meant that alternative therapeutic and preventative methods were urgently needed .
"the development of vaccines and other therapeutic agents usually takes at least a decade and costs hundreds of millions of dollars , yet a practical solution for sars was needed before the beginning of the next respiratory virus season .","in addition , other new microbial threats are likely to emerge , and scientists will again be asked to provide rapid solutions ."
"methods were developed for growing the virus in tissue culture ( using vero cells ) , and a neutralization assay was developed , both of which were necessary for vaccine development .",several programmes were put in place to clone and eress viral proteins that could be used both as reagents and in vaccine studies .
"the appearance of these neutralizing antibodies coincided with the onset of resolution of sars pneumonia , 10 and , as with other coronaviruses , there is an inverse relationship between disease severity and the levels of pre - existing serum antibodies .","although the immune correlates for protection against sars - cov are not yet completely defined , individuals convalescing from sars are known to develop high titres of neutralizing antibodies ."
"there are many potential vaccine strategies that can be considered for the sars - cov , including a whole killed viral vaccine , an attenuated virus , such as adenovirus or vaccinia virus , eressing sars proteins , recombinant sars proteins or dna vaccines .","successful vaccines have been developed for animal coronaviruses , indicating that one or more of these strategies might work ."
"in collaboration with the british columbia centre for disease control and health , which supplied the sars clinical virus strain ( known as toronto or tor - 2 ) , this centre generated the first genome sequence of the sars - cov within six days of receiving the viral nucleic acid .","several other groups followed with other genome sequences shortly thereafter , ."
"a vaccine approach was chosen for several reasons , including previous success with animal coronavirus vaccines , the ease of product development and the use of vaccines to prevent infection in cases of defined risk eure ( such as healthcare workers in hospitals ) .","this success , coupled with the concern that , in canada , quarantine would not contain the sars - cov , led to the provincial british columbia government providing cdn $2.6 million in april to establish the sars accelerated vaccine initiative ( savi ) that was dedicated to developing a human sars vaccine as rapidly as possible ."
"however , additional intellectual property issues will arise as the project progresses , and there will also be preexisting intellectual property in place that must be incorporated , such as the use of live attenuated vectors or protein eression systems .","savi was fortunate in that it is partnered with the group that sequenced the sars - cov , and they protected the genome sequence ."
"however , recently there have been significant concerns that primate models are not the best infection models , and tests in many laboratories indicate that they only exhibit mild respiratory infections . at present , ferrets seem to be the most relevant disease model , and relevant murine models have been developed that allow viral replication .","soon after , a macaque infection model was published , , and significant efforts were made to secure primates for these studies ."
"researchers who obtained funding are still held accountable to standard grant regulations and research guidelines , including adequate accounting and reporting on completion of the project .","a project director periodically reviews progress with each of the funded collaborators to ensure adequate progress and relevance , as well as coordinating diverse research groups ."
"although a macaque model has been described for sars , there were still questions regarding its suitability for vaccine testing .",at least three north american laboratories have had little success in observing lung pathology and severe clinical signs in macaques after live sars - cov challenge .
"some strains of mice , such as balb / c and c57 , have been shown to support sars - cov replication , but do not demonstrate significant pathology or clinical disease .","other small - animal models for sars such as ferrets and hamsters ( unpublished observations at the who meeting in rotterdam , ; ref ."
"however , having a large collection of clinical samples is crucial to understanding an infectious disease , and mechanisms for collecting and sharing such samples must be in place before an outbreak occurs .","when clinical samples are taken , especially early during the outbreak , the potential research uses of such samples are not known , and it is difficult to specify exactly what they will be used for ."
"however , performing rapid response research on highly infectious agents that are new to the world places a major burden on such specialized facilities , especially biosafety level iii large animal ( primate ) and gmp facilities .","owing to the perceived threat of biological agents , several biosafety level iii containment facilities have recently been approved for construction ."
the ability to do rapid research in response to an emerging infectious disease has significant appeal .,"as sars was seen as a major public health threat in canada and several countries in asia , these countries in particular felt compelled to act ."
"although this willingness is probably accentuated when one perceives a significant threat to one ' s country , it is also a powerful motivating factor when seeking to obtain particular eertise during rapid response research .","all scientists were willing to contribute their relevant eertise and a portion of their laboratory ' s resources to work towards a common goal , with no particular individual gain immediately obvious ."
"without an outbreak of sars that could be used to test the efficacy of the vaccines in humans , licensure of the vaccine under emergency conditions might have to take place under the fda ' s ' animal efficacy rule ' , which states that vaccines or other biological agents can be licensed if they meet two criteria : human safety and the demonstration of adequate protection against a deliberate infection challenge in two species of animals ( see vaccine policy in the online links ) .","ordinarily , phase i to phase iii human clinical trials are designed to provide an understanding of the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in humans as well as identification of correlates of immunity ."
aim : to outline the practicalities of whole genome sequencing and discuss how it might shape future infection control practice .,methods : we review conventional typing methods and compare these with the potential offered by whole genome sequencing .
", whole genome sequencing ( wgs ) allows clinical isolates of s . aureus to be compared with each other and with reference sequences across time and space , down to a resolution of a single nucleotide difference .","this enhances our knowledge of the population structure of s . aureus , allowing greater precision in describing and defining the different lineages , provides insights into the evolutionary history of lineages and offers the potential for an outbreak investigator to determine unambiguously the relatedness of isolates ."
"different patterns of carriage have been described : people may be persistent carriers ( 20% ) , intermittent carriers ( 30% ) , or non - carriers ( 50% ) .","sites for colonization include the anterior nares , the throat , the axilla , and the perineum ."
"most of the genome ( the core genome ) is composed of genes present in all strains that encode proteins involved in fundamental functions such as cellular metabolism , growth and replication .",about % of the genome consists of sets of genes that vary between different lineages and is designated the ' core variable genome ' .
indeed most of the strains that colonize humans belong to one of ten dominant lineages .,e16 most disease - causing isolates belong to a small number of lineages or clonal complexes .
concordance between mlst and spa - typing is high so that spa - typing is now used widely for mrsa typing .,"by contrast , spa - typing is based on the highly variable x - region of a single gene ( spa ) that encodes protein a ."
wgs resolves differences between isolates down to the level of individual nucleotides .,a unified typing scheme linked to a freely accessible universal database would be ideal .
"even when used in combination , conventional methods are limited in their potential to distinguish between isolates within a major lineage .","wgs offers a portable , reproducible method to detect the smallest of genetic differences ."
ngs first became available in and a number of different sequencing platforms are currently commercially available .,"these include the illumina platform ( illumina , san diego , ca , usa ) , genome sequencer ( roche applied science , rotkreuz , switzerland ) , solid platform ( life technologies , applied biosystems , carlsbad , ca , usa ) as well as the first bench - top machines such as the miseq ( illumina ) and iontorrent platforms ( life technologies ) which are anticipated to be among the first platforms to be routinely implemented for clinical applications ."
at the time of writing it is important to realize that the limitations of mapping - based and de novo assembly techniques for short read sequences mean that the term ' whole genome sequence ' actually refers to the e90 % of the entire genome that is actually rendered visible by those techniques .,the introduction of new platforms that generate much longer reads will make visible the remaining ' concealed ' sequences to routine analysis .
by comparing sequence data it is possible to infer phylogenetic relationships .,as a bacterial population evolves and diversifies from a common ancestor its constituent members accumulate differences in their genome sequences .
"with knowledge of the molecular clock , it is possible directly to convert a number of differences between two genomes into the length of evolutionary time that has elapsed since they last",estimate the rate at which mutations accumulate during the evolution of a genome .
the implementation of wgs to near real - time infection control practice would require eertise in technical issues of sequencing plus collaboration with specialist teams of bioinformaticians and analysts .,"besides the technical challenge of specimen preparation and sequencing , even greater hurdles to putting wgs into routine practice lie in how to perform bioinformatic analysis and optimize information technology infrastructure for data storage and exchange ."
used wgs to demonstrate that the strains of clostridium difficile associated with disease emerged from multiple lineages .,this contradicted the received wisdom that bacterial pathogens arise from a single lineage as a result of gaining genetic properties through gene transfer or mutation .
when put into practice wgs could revolutionize the principles of reference microbiology and tanomy .,"whole genome sequencing has the potential to improve our understanding of phylogeny , transmission and pathogenesis and to provide information that will enhance surveillance , guide outbreak investigation and improve disease management ."
"in the uk in recent decades , strategies to prevent nosocomial acquisition of s . aureus have been focused on the prevention and control of mrsa infection .",this focus is partly elained by the ease in being able to differentiate mrsa from sensitive strains and the recognition of the burden of disease caused by mrsa .
"genome sequencing of isolates in local laboratories would permit real - time generation of locally and nationally relevant epidemiological data , allowing strains to be tracked , their relative importance evaluated and control efforts to be meaningfully targeted .","furthermore , the higher level of discrimination will permit the detection and monitoring of newly emerging strains ."
genomic comparisons over time and space of isolates will provide clearer insights into the evolutionary history of s . aureus .,"as the wgs knowledge base grows , a much better understanding of staphylococcal population structures will be developed ."
there would then be a need to develop systems to check the reliability of wgs outputs as predictors of phenotypic characteristics such as antibiotic susceptibility .,with the continuing fall in sequencing costs it is conceivable that sequence - based methodologies might replace traditional methods as frontline diagnostic tests .
"despite these challenges , the steady decline in sequencing costs and the increasing ease of use of sequencing machines and their data outputs suggest that wgs will eventually replace a whole suite of current test strategies .",it seems clear that wgs will revolutionize our understanding of s . aureus and our ability to manage it as a pathogen .
"we reviewed available data from mers - cov case reports , and compared this with data on kinetics of shedding and immune response from published literature on other human coronaviruses ( hcovs ) .","however , optimal use of this core public health laboratory capacity requires a fundamental understanding of kinetics of viral shedding and antibody response , of assay validation and of interpretation of test outcomes ."
"one of the first described human coronaviruses , oc43 , shares a common recent ancestral history with bovine coronaviruses , suggesting these viruses may have emerged from animals as well .","in , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) emerged and was the first known major outbreak caused by a coronavirus ."
"however , optimal use of this core laboratory capacity requires embedding of data needs for laboratory scientists within the outbreak investigations , in order to obtain information needed for assay validation and correct interpretation of test outcomes .","laboratory response during the early stages of an outbreak therefore focuses on development of virological / microbiological and immunological methods for patient diagnosis , for contact tracing , and for epidemiological studies into sources , modes of transmission , identification of risk groups , screening of potential animal reservoirs , etc ."
crucial first questions for choice of sampling and subsequent interpretation of laboratory diagnostics are :,"in an early phase of emerging viral disease outbreaks , typically an initial comparison with clinical manifestations of other viruses from the same tanomic group is used to develop a sampling strategy ."
"what is the concentration of virus ( viral load ) in various body compartments , fluids and secreta during the progression of the disease ?",how are infection kinetics and loads influenced by host factors ( e . g .
"comparison of data between studies is difficult because specimen sampling is not standardised , with descriptions varying from naso - pharyngeal swab , naso - pharyngeal secretion , throat swab , nasal swab , oro - nasal swab , all reflecting "" upper respiratory tract "" sampling .",nasopharyngeal aspirates ( npa ) are the most common respiratory specimens described in the literature for molecular diagnosis of non - sars and sars coronaviruses .
"however , compared to sars there is less information about kinetics of shedding and viral loads in stools and respiratory samples .","observations in children hospitalized for other hcov suggests that gastro - intestinal shedding is limited , compared with sars , although all four hcovs species have been detected in patient stools ."
"b rdrpseq - rnested - in cases where no amplification products were obtain a second - round reaction pcr is set up using the same forward primer as in first round , and this reverse primer .","other mers patient ' s specimens such as urine , sera / plasma samples , and blood were very rarely tested , not allowing consistent a nucleotide numbering based on human betacoronvirus c emc / 2012 strain ."
"the urine specimens tested were only from the patient transferred to germany were rt - pcr was positive on days and , but not on day after renal failure .","sera / plasma samples collected from three patients ( late on disease progression ; - 20 days ) were all negative ( patients f , c1 , b ) ."
there are considerably differences among respiratory viruses in the ratio between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections .,"without proper studies , it is unclear if for instance asymptomatic persons can contribute to transmission ."
"antibody levels measured in this study were highest for persons with severe illness , indicating that different test cut - offs may be needed for the use of laboratory tests during public health investigations that aim to identify mild cases as well .",the presence of antibodies against sars - cov in individuals with no or mild symptoms has been described in healthcare workers .
"serological testing confirmed infection in two mers - cov patients ( from abu dhabi and qatar ) , hospitalized in germany .","this argument seems flawed , as the same could be argued for pcr assays that are used universally , with the limitations described above ."
"additionally the who recommends testing for novel coronavirus of persons , including health care workers , in clusters of acute respiratory infection of unknown aetiology , requiring hospitalisation , or where the respiratory infection is uneectedly severe .","according to the who guidance for health professionals , patients should be evaluate for mers - cov infection if they develop pneumonia or pneumonitis and fever with a history of travel to , or residence in , the arabian peninsula in the days before illness onset ; or contact with known confirmed or probable mers cases in the days before illness onset ."
"for confirmation , a second assay with a different set of primers and probes is recommended ( table ) .","in both algorithms a screening pcr targeting a region upstream of the e gene is proposed , sometimes combined with nucleocapsid ( n ) gene based pcr , to enhance sensitivity for specimen screening ."
serological assays for testing antibodies against mers coronavirus were developed by different laboratory eerts and can be used for human diagnostics as well ( table ) .,"however , no official recommendations are currently available regarding serological tests , and validation has been difficult because of limited availability of human convalescent sera ."
the who also emphasises repeat testing as initial results may be negative .,"as described above , it is strongly advised that lower respiratory specimens are collected when possible , in addition to nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens should be collected ."
"additionally , who requests that confirmed and probable cases be reported within h of being classified as such , through the regional contact point for international health regulations at the appropriate who regional office .",each probable or confirmed case of mers should be immediately communicated to the national health authorities .
"acute and convalescent serum samples should be collected from each patient to help define kinetics of seroconversion that will help to confirm or rule out infection in future patients , avoid misdiagnosis ( false negative test results ) due low sensitivity in an early phase of infection when antibody levels are low , and to control for non - specific reactivity .","until full validation of laboratory assays has been done , the combined use of molecular and serological approaches is highly recommended ."
it is documented that the virus can be transmitted to newborn babies from their mothers .,the zika virus is transmitted to humans primarily through aedes mosquitoes and through sexual contact .
the impact of isolation on the number of infected individuals and the accumulated cost is assessed and compared with the constant control case .,"assuming infection prevalence in the population under constant control , optimal control theory is used to devise an optimal hospitalization / isolation control strategy for the model ."
"it belongs to the family of flaviviruses which includes more than fifty viruses , such as dengue , yellow fever , and the west nile virus .","the zika virus spreads among humans primarily through an infected mosquito bite , which has been increasing at an alarming incidence rate worldwide over the past few years ( dick et al . , ) ."
the first isolation was made in april of from the serum of pyrexia rhesus monkey caged .,"the second isolation was made in in the same forest ( dick et al . , ) ."
"the first well - documented case of zika fever was reported in and started with a mild headache with later development of a maculopapular rash , fever , and back pain ( hayes , ) .",the symptoms of zika fever are thus quite similar to those of dengue fever and there is a strong possibility of misdiagnosis in regions where dengue virus is common .
"after the zika outbreak , models for zika transmission have been developed ( agustoa et al . , ; maxiana et al . , ; wiratsudakul et al . , ) and analyzed .","in the past several years , a number of deterministic models for the transmission dynamics of the dengue virus have been studied and analyzed ( esteva and vargas , ferguson et al . , ; garba et al . , garba et al . , , kautner et al . , ; wearing and rohani , ) ."
there is no backward bifurcation and the steady states results are global .,"since the only way to control the disease is to isolate patients who have been infected with the zika virus , we included a new population compartment consisting of hospitalized individuals ."
basic properties and a detailed steady - state analysis of the model are presented in section .,"the rest of this paper is organized as follows , the proposed model is presented in section ."
"the total human and mosquitoes populations at time t , denoted by n h and n v , are constant .",we consider two types of populations in this model one for the humans and for the mosquitoes .
we have assumed that the hospitalized individuals do not contribute to vertical transmission .,"in order to consider vertical transmission in our model , we make the assumption ( see , e . g . , li et al . , ) that a fraction of newborn individuals from parents in the e h ( t ) and i h ( t ) classes will be infected , and thus remain in e h class before becoming infectious ."
"because of this vertical transmission , a fraction of susceptible individuals will enter the eed class .","a fraction of offsprings in the e t v and i t v classes will be infected , and thus remain in e h class before becoming infectious ."
"v in addition , eed vectors develop symptoms and move to the infected vector class i v at a rate of v .","it is assumed that infected vectors do not recover , and die at the natural death rate of v ."
"the only way to control this disease is to reduce the contact rate either by killing the mosquitoes or using the protective measure like mosquito repellents , nets etc .",as mentioned earlier there is no vaccine available for zika fever .
"following the notation of van den driessche and watmough , the matrix f ( for the new infection terms ) and the matrix v ( of the transition terms ) are given , respectively , by progression rate of humans from eed to infected class hospitalization rate of infected individuals v progression rate of vectors from eed to infected class c hv effective contact rate","in order to investigate the local stability of the dfe , the next generation operator method ( van den driessche and watmough , ) will be used ."
"the square root means that the two generations required for an infected vector or host to reproduce itself ( van den driessche and watmough , ) .","note that r c is the basic reproductive number for horizontal transmission ( khan et al . , ) ."
"this means that the omega limit set of x , (x ) , is contained in the disease - free space .","but , on the other hand , it is straightforward to check that every solution with the initial condition in the disease - free space converges to"
we define endemic equilibrium to be those fixed points of the system in which at least one of the infected compartments of the model are non - zero .,"in this section , the existence and stability of endemic equilibrium ( ee ) of the model will be discussed ."
shows the effect of hospitalization rate of infected individuals on the basic reproductive number r .,"from this figure , we can see that effective isolation will help to reduce the basic reproductive number ."
"this , together with uniformly weakly persistent imply ( see smith and thieme , , theorem ) .","in this case there exists an endemic steady state ( smith and thieme , ) ."
"in this case , it is easily seen that both for the host population and for the vector population the corresponding total population sizes are asymptotically constant .",we assumed that in our model the total population is constant .
"in this section , we carry out a parameter base global uncertainty and sensitivity analyses on r .",the variation in the values of the parameters of our model is a source of uncertainty and sensitivity .
"the optimal objective system , which characterizes the optimal controls , consists of differential equations of the original model ( state system ) along with the adjoint differential equations ( the adjoint system ) .",the number of equations in the adjoint system is same as that of in the state system .
our aim is to minimize the associated cost function which is given as :,here is a positive number and is defined as the maximum value attained during optimal control procedure .
moreover a linear function has been chosen for cost incurred by infected individuals and the mosquitoes population .,our objective is to find an optimal control for hospitalization rate * ( t ) such that
pontrayagin ' s maximum principal converts model and objective function into minimizing the hamiltonian with respect to .,now we prove the following theorem to elicit the effect of optimal control of hospitalization .
the adjoint equations are then solved using the fourth - order backward runge - kutta method because of the presence of final conditions .,"since there are initial conditions present for the state equations , we start solving them with a guess for using the fourth - order forward runge - kutta method ."
we observed that optimal control strategy is most effective in terms of eliminating infection as it minimizes our cost and resources at the same time .,"moreover , the control measures themselves may take time to implement , once the outbreak has been realized ."
"studying extracellular vesicle ( ev ) , particularly emes , is holding great promise , yet technically challenging in defining such small and molecularly diverse nanovesicles .","with intrinsic molecular payload and biodegradability , molecular engineering of emes opens new avenues for mediating cellular responses and developing novel nano - delivery systems in precision therapeutics ."
eme - based precision medicine for cancer diagnosis and prognosis gains substantial attention and holds great promise - 2 .,"however , studying emes is extremely challenging , due to enormous technical difficulties in defining and analyzing such small and molecularly diverse nanovesicles ."
"inward invagination occurs at the endosomal membrane , which creates small membrane - bound intraluminal vesicles ( ilvs ) .","at this point , the endosome is referred to as a multivesicular body ( mvbs ) ."
"in contrast in fig . 1 , microvesicles are formed directly through outward budding of the plasma membrane and can range from around nm to m in diameter .","in comparison to emes and microvesicles , apoptotic bodies fragmented from apoptotic cells are currently of little interest for therapeutic applications and will not be discussed in this perspective review ."
the protein content of evs reflects the presence of proteins in the parent cell at the time of formation .,"as a result , both emes and microvesicles contain biomolecules specific to parent cellular function and status , such as , but not limited to , cytosolic proteins ( tubulin , actin , actin - binding proteins ) , signal transduction proteins ( protein kinases , - 3 - 3 , heterotrimeric g proteins ) , nucleic acids , metabolic enzymes ( peroxidases , pyruvate , lipid kinases , enolase ) , tetraspanins , and heat shock proteins ( hsp70 , hsp90 ) ."
"cancer immunotherapy could benefit the most from such engineered molecular targeting mechanisms , as it increases the accuracy of drug delivery and decreases systemic toxic effects of therapy .",evs have a natural tendency to accumulate in solid tumors due to the high penetration and enhanced retention in the dense tissue microenvironment .
eme encapsulated drugs have proved to be valuable in addressing multiple clinical issues such as therapeutic resistance and the toxicity to central nervous system .,several phase ii clinical studies have recently been initiated as well for treating malignant ascites and pleural effusion using tumor cellderived vesicles loaded with chemotherapeutic drugs ( clinicaltrials . gov ) .
we summarize the latest engineering strategies for modifying and reconstructing emes employed in drug delivery and cancer immunotherapy .,"generally , there are two broad strategies for eme engineering : ) manipulation of parent cells either through genetic or metabolic engineering ; ) functionalization of purified emes using surface molecular engineering and membrane permeabilization ."
"al , tumorspecific targeting was achieved by transfecting immature dendritic cells ( dcs ) for eressing lamp2b emal membrane proteins fused with the breast cancer cell - specific irgd peptide .",over % emes secreted from engineered dcs displayed lamp2b on their surface .
", subsequent systemic administration of engineered emes in mice showed the inhibition of beta - site app - cleaving enzyme and protein eression in the brain .","adapted in , electroporation was successfully applied to load sirna into emes by alvarez - erviti and colleagues ."
the future perspectives and pitfalls in precision therapeutics will be discussed as well .,"in this section , we review the advances of microfluidic technology for engineering evs and emes , which is the area we anticipate growing enentially in the next five years ."
"using conventional soft - lithography and polydimethylsiloxane ( pdms ) device molding , this microfluidic approach is facile and scalable , with a high flow throughput of l / min .","the similar delivery ability of engineered eme mimetics was found as the naturally secreted emes , by comparing egenous genes in the recipient cells ."
living cells entered into the flow are subjected to slicing by touching the sharp edge of silicon blade .,the dry etching removes the sixny layer and the silicon oxide layer for eing silicon substrate .
"c , eme mimetics were directly produced by fragmenting cells during centrifugation ( 1 cells at rpm ) , due to the shear force and elongation of cells while passing through hydrophilic , micro - sized pores .",the quantity of eme mimetics produced by this centrifuge micro - device could be - fold higher than that from naturally secreted emes .
"due to the nature of micro - scale , mass transfer is much more efficient and able to achieve thousand - fold enhancements for fluids mixing , specific molecular binding , and transport .",the functional integration also allows multiple processing steps to be automated in one device for high throughput and scale up .
"although it has not been reported so far for transfecting emes via microfluidic electroporation approach , several unmatched capabilities offered by microfluidic electroporation is obvious , including ) precisely controlled electric field and electric pulse in spatial and temporary for high - efficiency electroporation ; ) microscale dimension allows low potential difference which greatly reduces side effects often seen by benchtop approach ; ) the ph variation and joule heating caused by electric fields can be minimized in microscale ; ) the high functional integration , high throughput , and scale up are amenable and straightforward .","for instance , microfluidic platforms have been introduced in cell electroporation for the past two decades , which will have great adaptability for electroporating extracellular vesicles and emes ."
"this high - efficient mass transport , as well as a high surface to volume ratio of microstructures perfectly meet the needs of surface engineering , either for delivering hydrophobic therapeutics to eme membrane or facilitating affinity binding reactions .",", our research group developed an eearch chip with a serpentine microfluidic mixer previously to enhance immunomagnetic bead - based eme isolation and detection ."
"thus , bioengineering of emes is becoming more and more important .",traditional benchtop methods for eme modifications will continue to play a significant role in the future .
the high specificity and high sensitivity offered by microfluidic approach would also contribute to high - resolution manipulation of emes for clinical applications .,"presently , the biggest challenge for microfluidic engineering of emes still lies in the processing volume that is required for meeting large - scale therapeutic demands ."
a polymerase chain reaction - based assay for respiratory viruses was performed on nasal samples .,nasal samples were obtained during asymptomatic surveillance visits and during symptomatic uris .
"healthy children ages - 96 months were recruited in a rolling fashion from primary care pediatric practices in madison , wisconsin and followed for year .",families of eligible children received information about the study by mail approximately weeks before their next scheduled wellchild visit .
"the diagnosis of sinusitis was based on one of the following clinical criteria : persistent symptoms - respiratory symptoms , including nasal discharge or cough or both , that lasted more than days and were not improving ( symptom score at days $50 % of highest score ) ; severe symptoms - a combination of purulent ( thick , colored , and opaque ) nasal discharge plus temperature > 39 c for at least hours ; or worsening symptoms - sudden onset of respiratory symptoms or fever after apparent improvement , usually beyond the sixth day of illness .",samples of nasal mucus were obtained using an established nose blowing technique .
gee also was used to estimate the proportion of visits each calendar month in which each virus was present .,models with a term for visit type were used to compare percentages between surveillance and uri visits .
estimated mean symptom scores were transformed back to the original scale .,symptom scores were transformed to the log ( x + 2 ) before analysis to obtain approximately symmetrically distributed residuals .
the subgroup of children who completed the study was used to calculate the frequency of uris per subject per year .,all subjects are the cohort in whom the characteristics of uris are described .
the frequency of detection of the viruses in uri visits is shown in figure .,"rv was the most commonly detected virus , occurring in of ( 49% ) uris ."
the distribution of viruses in these visits is also shown in figure .,polymerase chain reaction for respiratory viruses was also performed on nasal samples obtained at asymptomatic surveillance visits in study subjects .
"of all the viruses assayed , piv , flu , and rsv were the most likely to be associated with uri rather than asymptomatic surveillance visits .","the types of covs , flu , rsv , and piv detected are shown in table ii ( available at ) ."
there were different subtypes of rv detected in the rv - positive samples obtained from symptomatic patients .,the number of unique rv types per subject ranged between and .
"fever was reported by parental history in % of uri episodes ; the average reported temperature in febrile uris was c . fever was most likely to be present in uris associated with flu ( 53% , or , % ci - 12 , p < . 001 ) and less likely to be present in uris with rv ( 12% , or 3 ci - 0.6 p < . 001 ) .","nasal congestion and nasal discharge were the most common symptoms reported by parents in % of uris , followed by daytime cough ( 75% ) , night time cough ( 64% ) , sore throat ( 26% ) , vomiting ( 9% ) , diarrhea ( 4% ) , and rash ( 3% ) ."
"by the th and th day of illness , % and %, respectively , of subjects had resolution of uri symptoms .",mean symptom scores from uris associated with rv were significantly lower than scores from uris with all other non - rv viruses with a day symptom score of ( ci - 8.7 ) for rv vs a score of ( ci - 9.9 ) for non - rv viruses ( p < . 005 ) .
uris resulted in missed school or day care % of the time ; the mean number of days missed for affected children was ( range - 12 days ) .,"likewise , a parent or caregiver missed work because of the child ' s uri % of the time ; the mean number of days missed was ( range - 12 days ) for affected caregivers ."
"the episodes of sinusitis occurred in children : episode each in children , episodes each in children , and episodes in child .","of episodes of symptomatic uri , ( 8.8% , ci % - 12.6% ) met predefined criteria for sinusitis , which was the most common complication ."
"the unique features of this study include prospective follow - up of preschool / young school age children for year , quarterly nasal sampling when children were well , and inclusion of consecutive respiratory seasons , thereby dampening the effect of year - toyear variation in prevalence of different respiratory viruses .",this age group was specifically chosen to determine the rate of sinusitis complicating uri because the frequency of uri is high and the risk of acute otitis media is considerably lower than during the first years of life .
"the risk of uri was greatest with rv - c and then rv - a , but rv - b was not significantly associated with illness , which is in agreement with previous findings in infants .","in addition , the probability of symptomatic illness was related to rv species ."
studies relying on self - report of uris can underestimate the frequency of illnesses .,"lastly , nasal rather than nasopharyngeal samples were used to identify viruses , which may have overestimated the rate of rv and underestimated the role of piv , hmpv , flu , and rsv ."
"most of them do not have trnas , their translation relies on hosts ' trna pools .","over the course of evolution , viruses needed to optimally eloit cellular processes of their host ."
"bstvs must fit to their diverse hosts and , thus , the extent of matching for codon usage would be lower than that of nstvs , which must fit few , similar hosts .","because bstvs must fit to multiple hosts and their diverse trna pools and their codon usage has a relationship with their host , a tradeoff exists regarding the extent of codon usage ."
"accession numbers and other detailed information of these viruses , such as strain names , isolate hosts and host ranges were also retrieved ( supplementary table ) .",the information of host range was determined from ncbi and the ninth report of the international committee on tanomy of viruses ( viralzone database : ) .
"md values ( mean sd ) were 388 121 , 383 083 , and 427 045 in the three hosts , respectively ( supplementary table ) .","the strains of arboviruses that belonged to bstvs were optimized according to their hosts ' trna pool eression systems ( host : arthropods , mammals , gallus gallus ) ."
the ability to enter the host - cell and efficiently replicate itself is essential for viral infection .,viruses have coevolved many pathways to transcribe their own genetic material in their hosts ( harwig et al .
group is the similarity degree between nstvs and a particular host .,group is the similarity degree between bstvs and gallus gallus .
this study aimed to identify the most common viral strains responsible for respiratory tract infections in asthma / copd patients ( without exacerbations ) in qatar during the winter season .,respiratory viruses in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) or asthma have not been characterised in qatar .
nasal swabs from patients with asthma / copd and respiratory symptoms were evaluated for common viruses .,this study aimed to identify the most common viral strains responsible for respiratory tract infections in asthma / copd patients ( without exacerbations ) in qatar during the winter season .
"have reported that a total of % of copd exacerbations in the uk were associated with the bacterial pathogen haemophilus influenzae , and rhinovirus was identified in % of exacerbations .","however , higher bacterial loads were observed in exacerbations with both rhinovirus and h . influenzae , thus suggesting that interaction between these pathogens may contribute to exacerbation severity ."
identifying viral aetiology associated with respiratory tract infections in asthma and copd is useful for the development of strategies for the prevention and treatment of infections leading to exacerbations in this vulnerable population .,"much of the morbidity , mortality , and excess health - care utilisation associated with asthma and copd are related to exacerbations ."
the objective of this study was to identify viral strains responsible for respiratory tract infection in asthma / copd adult patients who visited the chest clinic in qatar during the winter season from october to march ( corresponding to the annual peak in respiratory infections in qatar ) in order to identify the viral pathogens involved .,"in this study , we sought to determine the burden of respiratory viruses in adult patients with asthma / copd in qatar , using real - time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) ."
all patients had at least five symptoms of respiratory tract infection ( table ) but otherwise were stable and had no exacerbation of copd / asthma at the time of sample collection .,the most common symptoms in all patients were dry cough and wheezing .
"all study participants signed informed consent forms according to the recommendations of the hamad medical corporation research committee , which approved the study .",the study protocol was approved by the research committee of hamad medical corporation .
an aliquot of processed samples was frozen at c for subsequent rna extraction and polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) .,"rna extraction from the frozen samples was performed using a standard extraction kit ( the primers and probe were used at a concentration according to the manufacturer ' s instructions ( ftd respiratory pathogen samples , mikrogen tm ) ."
all patients were aged c18 years ( average age of asthma patients = yr [ ranges ; n = for - 35 yr ; n = for - 55 yr ; n = for [ 55 yr ] ; average age copd patients = yr [ ranges n = for - 35 yr ; n = for - 55 yr ; n = for [ 55 yr ) .,a total of adult patients ( 135 females and males ) were enrolled : patients of arab origin and patients of non - arab origin .
it may also be that other pathogens are involved in respiratory tract infections affecting middle eastern populations .,"for example , metapneumovirus has been shown to affect adults with respiratory tract infections and wheezing in this region ."
"however , the effects of smoking were difficult to evaluate due to the small number of smokers in the population .",we found that the distribution of viral infections did not correlate with the age and ethnic background of the patient .
"finally , this study was limited to the ' ' winter season ' ' in qatar , and it may be that the infection pattern changes throughout the year .","another potential shortcoming is that a control population was not included in the study ; therefore , the frequency of rhinovirus or coronavirus infections in populations hospitalised with non - respiratory conditions or in asymptomatic populations or non - asthmatic or non - copd populations with respiratory tract infections cannot be determined ."
"in addition , the relatively low number of viruses found in our sample population may point towards other pathogens ( viral or bacterial pathogens not investigated here ) that may be implicated in causing urtis in patients in qatar .","the morbidity associated with rhinovirus and coronavirus infections , especially in high - risk populations such as patients with asthma or copd , suggest that these infections should be a target for prevention or treatment strategies ."
"immunization with psoralen - treated virus intraperitoneally in freund ' s complete adjuvant or oronasally failed to protect from live virus challenge , but survivors had elevated virus - specific serum igg antibody titers compared to mock - immunized controls at two weeks post - challenge .",spleen cells from mice that were challenged after recovery from homotypic live virus infection did not exhibit the profound in vitro t cell suppression normally observed during the acute stage of primary infection .
"mouse hepatitis virus ( mhv ) is a highly contagious coronavirus infecting laboratory mice worldwide at high prevalence , usually without clinical signs .","the impact of infection on research involving mice is enormous , with several adverse effects on biological responses of mice having been demonstrated [ 3 - 5 , , - 14 , , , ] ."
the major goal of this study was to determine whether the t cell dysfunction observed after mhv inoculation of a susceptible genotype by a natural route is due directly to active virus infection or indirectly to interaction with mhv antigens .,the goal was addressed by characterizing the responses of mice that were eed to virus inactivated by any of several physical or chemical methods and of mice that were challenged after recovery from live virus immunization .
both virus stocks had titers of intracerebral infant mouse lds0 per ml .,"mhv - jhm and mhv - s ( american type culture collection , rockville , md ) were used in the fonxl of infected infant mouse brain homogenates ."
"all mice were housed in micro - isolator cages ( lab products , maywood , nj ) and were given food and water ad libitum .",manipulations and husbandry were performed in a class ii biological safety cabinet .
concanavalin a ( con a ; sigma chemical co . ) was used at a final concentration of gg / ml .,"rat monoclonal antibodies to mouse il2 , designated $4b 6 [ 2 8 i , and il4 , designated l lbll , were originally obtained from t . mosmann ( $4b 6 ) and j . ohara and w . e . paul ( 11 b ) and were kindly provided by dr . kim bottomly ( section of immunobiology and howard hughes medical institute , yale university ) ."
bpl inactivation was accomplished by adding one volume of the % stock solution to nine volumes of stock virus .,beta - propiolactone ( bpl ) is an alkylating agent that reacts with guanidine residues of rna and dna and is considered moderately effective in maintaining antigenic structure .
"aliquots were removed after ( prior to uv light eure ) , , , , , , and min and stored at c .","ultraviolet irradiation from below was accomplished with a long - wave uv transilluminator ( model tl33 , uvp , inc . , san gabriel , ca ) emitting at a wavelength of nm with an average intensity of ~ tw / cm ."
inactivation of psoralen - treated mhv - jhm was further confirmed by the inability of primers specific for a segment of the m gene to amplify in polymerase chain reaction .,"the concentration of infectious virus in the liver is very high during the acute phase of active infection , and there is a % correlation between liver histopathology and virus recovery from this major target organ ( smith and barthold , unpubl , obs . ) ."
"briefly , spleen cells from individual balb mice eed oronasally to inactivated or live virus four , five or seven days earlier were suspended in ml of rpmi medium ( gibco brl , gaithersburg , md ) containing % fetal bovine serum ( gibco brl ) , 5 mm - mercaptoethanol ( sigma chemical co . ) and mm l - glutamine ( gibco brl ) [ rpmi ] .",cell suspensions were diluted as needed in filtered normal saline containing % trypan blue and % ammonium chloride to determine viable nucleated cell counts .
supernates from con astimulated cultures that induced proliferation of ctll - 2 cells were serially diluted and retested with $4b 6 ( anti - il2 ) and b11 ( anti - il4 ) monoclonal antibodies .,supernates collected from spleen cells cultured with con a or rpmi - 5 for h were assyed on ctll - 2 cells as described earlier .
"two weeks after the booster dose , a drop of blood was collected from the tip of the tail for serology , and the mice were challenged intranasally with iclds0 of live mhv - jhm .",the mice were observed for mortality and eanguinated at days post - challenge .
con a - induced proliferation and il2 production by spleen cells collected four days after challenge were measured as described above .,"to determine the effect of prior vaccination with live virus on in vitro t cell function after subsequent challenge , balb mice were inoculated oronasally with sterile culture medium , mhv - jhm or mhv - s . after four weeks , an interval in which mice fully recover from oronasat mhv infection , small blood samples were collected to verify seroconversion , and all of the mice were challenged oronasally with mhv - jhm ."
il2 production by cultured spleen cells was generally correlated with proliferative capacity ( table ) .,"cells from actively infected mice were still functionally suppressed at this interval , with proliferative values of to % of control ( table ) ."
"il2 production was generally correlated with the magnitude of the proliferative response ( table ) , and serial dilutions yielded the eected dose - response curve ( data not shown ) .",proliferation of cells from the remaining six mice ranged from to % of control proliferation .
"responses of cells from mice given uv - treated mhv - jhm were quite variable in three separate eeriments , despite the fact that confirmation of virus inactivation was obtained for each inoculated mouse .",cells from four of four mice given bplinactivated virus and tested seven days later were hyper - responsive .
"it may also be argued that oronasal eure to killed virus may be less likely to stimulate an immune response than parenteral inoculation , with or without adjuvant .",mice given mhv - jhm inactivated by any of the methods described clearly did not receive enough antigen to induce seroconversion .
"therefore , it has been placed by the eerts in the list of viruses that pose a threat to cause epidemics and pandemics .","the virus has travelled from saudi arabia to europe , where new cases are being reported ."
universal vaccines targeting conserved viral components might provide cross - protection and thus complement and improve conventional vaccines .,"in this study , we generated dna plasmids and recombinant vaccinia viruses eressing the conserved proteins nucleoprotein ( np ) , polymerase basic ( pb1 ) , and matrix ( m1 ) from influenza virus strain a / beijing / 30 / 95 ( h3n2 ) ."
"however , ha - and na - based conventional influenza vaccines sometimes fail to prevent flu epidemics because the ha and / or na in the vaccine strains is a mismatch with that in circulating virus strains .",universal influenza vaccines ( uivs ) that induce effective and long - term cross - protection and address the risk of mismatch may overcome the shortcomings of conventional influenza vaccines .
"for example , np was often used in combination with m1 or m2e to provide protection superior to that conferred by either antigen alone .","in addition , uivs containing influenza virus ha , m1 , and / or np provided effective cross - protection against a lethal challenge of influenza virus ( 38 , ."
"we then investigated the ability of these vaccines to induce immunity and provide cross - protection against pr8 challenge in mice immunized with dna vaccines , rvv vaccines , or dna prime - rvv boost regimens based on a sole antigen or a combination of the three antigens .","in the present study , we generated uivs based on np , m1 , and pb1 in dna plasmids and recombinant vaccinia virus ( rvv ) ."

"cef cells were infected with rvv at an moi of to , and the eression of np , pb1 , and m1 was confirmed h to h later using rabbit polyclonal np - specific antiserum ( obtained by immunizing rabbits with purified np - 167 aa [ aa , amino acids ] in our laboratory ) , goat polyclonal pb1 - specific antibodies ( santa cruz ) , and goat polyclonal m1specific antibodies ( santa cruz ) , respectively .","meanwhile , the eression of the target proteins was confirmed using immunoblotting ."
"the combined immunization group was injected with g of psca - np , g of psca - pb1 , and g of psca - m1 mixed in a total volume of l of pbs .",mice immunized with the empty psca vector were used as the control group ( psca - c or dna - c ) .
"mice were primed with three doses of g of dna plasmids at weeks , , and and then boosted with one dose of pfu of rvv at week .",the third group was immunized with a dna prime - rvv boost ( dna rvv ) .
"spleen mononuclear cells ( smncs ) were obtained after depletion of erythrocytes from spleen cells using ammoniumchloride - potassium ( ack ) lysis buffer ( 0.15 mol / liter nh cl , 1 mol / liter khco , and mol / liter na - edta h o [ ph to ] ) .","in addition , mice were anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital ( 10 mg / ml ) at a dose of mg / kg of body weight and then challenged with l of , , or ld of pr8 by intranasal administration ."
the results for each group are presented as means standard deviations ( sd ) .,the number of peptide - reactive cells was presented as the number of spotforming cells ( sfc ) per smncs and was calculated by subtracting the number of spots in the unstimulated control wells from that in specific peptide - containing wells .
"the eression of np , pb1 , and m1 in mdck cells transiently transfected with psca - np , psca - pb1 , and psca - m1 , respectively , was confirmed using indirect immunofluorescence assays ( fig .",the plasmids were verified using sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion ( data not shown ) .
"to investigate whether the np - , pb1 - , or m1 - based vaccine generated influenza a virus - specific antibodies and cellular immune responses in vivo , mice were vaccinated intramuscularly with the dna plasmids , rvv , or dna prime - rvv boosts ; empty vector psca - c , mock rvv - c , and psca - c rvv - c served as the respective negative controls ( table ) .","humoral and cellular immune responses were induced by immunization with dna , rvv , or dna prime - rvv boost ."
"in addition , rvv - np vaccination induced higher elisa igg titers than did psca - np ( p 01 ) .","importantly , psca - np prime - rvv - np boost immunization induced a higher igg titer than that of the two above - mentioned groups ( p 01 ) ."
m1 - based vaccines did not increase any of the monitored parameters compared with the negative controls at week ( data not shown ) .,"np - pb1 - m1 combination vaccines induced only np - specific cellular immune responses , and dna prime - rvv boost immunization induced the strongest immune response ( p 1 ) ."
"d , left ) , and all those immunized with rvv - m1 succumbed to infection .","the mice immunized with psca - m1 had a % survival rate , which was significantly higher than that of those immunized with rvv - m1 ."
"regarding rvv vaccines , rvv - m1 exhibited poorer protective efficacy than did rvv - pb1 , whereas the highest protective efficacy was induced by rvv - np , which resulted in a % survival rate .","meanwhile , combination immunization with rvv - np , rvv - pb1 , and rvv - m1 induced some protection , as evidenced by an % survival rate ."
"with the dna prime - rvv boost strategy , only psca - np rvv - np immunization resulted in optimal protection and achieved a % survival rate .","these data suggest that dna or rvv vaccines based on a single np , pb1 , or m1 antigen did not protect mice against lethal challenge with ld of pr8 ."
"combination immunization with the three - antigen - based dna or rvv vaccines conferred fair protection against challenge with ld of pr8 , as well as a degree of protection against challenge with ld of pr8 .","finally , dna prime - rvv boost immunization protected mice completely against challenge with ld and ld of pr8 ."
"in addition , a combination of the three antigens induced good protection against challenge with ld of pr8 .","taken together , these data suggest that among the three antigens np , pb1 , and m1 , only np showed optimal protection against challenge with a high dose of pr8 ."
"for example , the universal influenza vaccine n8295 produced by dynavax and mva - np m1 by oxford include np .","consistent with this , np is the preferred candidate antigen in the research and development of uivs ."
"to improve the protective efficacy of uivs , combination vaccines using multiple target antigens have been developed .","in previous studies , the whole genes or epitopes of ha , m1 , and / or np were used for development of combination vaccines ; these induced effective cross - protection ( 32 , , ."
"specifically , % of the mice immunized with np - pb1 - m1 combination vaccines using the dna prime - rvv boost strategy survived challenge with ld of pr8 , which was comparable to the survival rate of mice immunized with np - based vaccines .","therefore , the protective efficacy of the combination vaccines must be improved further , as they did not induce a comprehensive immune response ."
"accordingly , the dna prime - rvv boost immunization strategy is superior to single dna or rvv vaccine immunization .",previous data suggested that the prime - boost strategy not only increased the number of memory c t cells but also enhanced the function of c t cells .
"this suggests that the np - specific humoral and cellular immune responses , pb1 - related cellular response , and m1 - related humoral response might play roles in protection against heterologous challenge .","in the current study , np immunization induced specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice , whereas pb1 immunization induced only a specific cellular response , and m1 immunization induced only a marked humoral immune response ."
"other mouse strains , such as cba and c57 / bl6 , mount stronger responses against pb1 , making it likely that pb1 - or m1 - based universal vaccines might induce better immune responses and protective effects in these mouse strains .","it is worth considering that although commonly used mouse strains generate strong t - cell responses to np , balb / c mice do not generate ctl responses against pb1 or m1 ."
"once the appropriate antigen or antigen combination has been confirmed , the immunization schedule should be optimized for routine use in a future eeriment using a single immunogen with a single vaccination .","our primary aim was to confirm the immunogenicity of the np , m1 , and pb1 antigens ."
previous studies of recombinant vaccinia virus vaccines used single intraperitoneal inoculations in mice .,"in our previous study , vaccinia virus - vectored vaccines induced a stronger immune response with intraperitoneal than with intramuscular administration ( data not shown ) ; however , intramuscular inoculation is preferred for routine use in humans ."
"ether - split influenza virus was used as a target antigen for assessing the antibody responses ; therefore , it is possible that the magnitude of the pb1 - specific antibody response ( particularly compared with that of np and m1 ) was underestimated significantly , because there is comparatively little pb1 present in influenza virions compared with that in np or m1 .","in future eeriments , it would be more appropriate to use recombinant proteins to assess this possibility and optimize the detection methods ."
np was the most effective of the three antigens and conferred protection against heterologous pr8 challenge .,"uivs based on a combination of np , pb1 , and m1 would likely induce strong immune responses ; therefore , they might be an alternative approach for preventing future influenza virus pandemics ."
"more than % of the general population may , depending on definition , be classified as mbl deficient , underlining the redundancy of the immune system .",ongoing research attempt to illuminate at which conditions mbl deficiency may lead to disease .
"a number of different molecules are involved in recognizing the foreign agents through structures displayed on their surface , the socalled pathogen associated molecular patterns or pamps .","the innate immune system is attracting interest , not only because of its action in the immediate defence against infections , but also because of its importance for activating an adequate specific immune response ."
"mbl was discovered as a rabbit protein binding to mannan and termed mannan - binding protein ( mbp ) ( kawasaki et al . , ) .","later the term mannose - binding protein was introduced , unfortunately implying a more selective reactivity than is characteristic for this protein ."
"however , the finding of genetic influence on the mbl level ( reviewed in nuytinck and shapiro , ) opened up for determining the mbl status by genotyping .","initially , investigations of causal relationship between mbl and disease susceptibility relied on quantification of mbl in serum or plasma ( or in some cases , of opsonizing activity ) ."
"the inter - individual levels of mbl vary from approximately ng ( no individual completely deficient in mbl has yet been reported ) to more than g / ml , but the level of mbl in each individual is quite stable throughout life .","at birth , the level is about / 3 of adult level , which is reached in a month , and there is a minor decline in old age ."

"the frequency of the haplotypes differ between ethnic groups with , e . g . , lypb being the common variant haplotype in caucasians ( 12% ) and asians ( 22% ) , but very rare in africans .","in contrast , lyqc is the common variant haplotype in africans ( 24% ) but rarely found in caucasian and asian people ."
"in our eerience ( unpublished ) , they all work satisfactorily , measuring levels comparable to what we determine with our in - house assay based on catching mbl onto a mannan surface followed by detection of bound mbl by mab - 1 anti - mbl antibody ( thiel et al . , ) .","measuring mbl is easy and today there are several commercial suppliers of elisa kits ( sanquin reagents , amsterdam , the netherlands ; hycult biotechnology , leiden , the netherlands ; antibodyshop , copenhagen , denmark ; dobeel corp , south korea ) ."
"thus , the sample , serum or plasma ( high salt also abolishes coagulation ) , is diluted in a buffer containing m nacl and calcium .","following incubation in the mannancoated wells and wash , c4 is added , and deposited c4b is estimated after incubation at c . the results of this assay correlate ( r = 6 ) with the assay for mbl as lectin or antigen ( thiel et al . , ) , except in case of masp - 2 deficiency ( stengaard - pedersen et al . , ) ."
when addressing possible correlation between mbl levels and clinical conditions an issue is how to define mbl deficiency .,the physiologically relevant mbl level leading to clinical manifestations is likely to differ in different diseases .
"judged from clinical trials it appears that at least ng mbl / ml plasma is needed for reconstituting in vitro functional activity ( c4b deposition ) after mbl infusion in mbl deficient individuals ( valdimarsson et al . , ) .","in the examples given below , a number of different levels have been used as cut - off values defining mbl defiency ."
"it turns out to be fairly difficult to compare these studies due to a number of aspects : the studies include patients with a variety of underlying malignancies and thus different chemotherapy regimes have been used ; some studies only examine mbl genotypes ( and may in some cases disregard the strong influence of the promoter allotype , la ) , while others use mbl levels ; the outcome measures differ between the studies ( duration of fever and neutropenia - serious infection ( with some variation in definition ) ); different combinations of antimicrobial agents and g - csf has been used at different centers ; the study period differs ; some are prospective , most are retrospective , which may present difficulties due to variability in journal keeping , e . g . , registration of febrile episodes .",several studies have thus attempted to analyze the correlation between mbl deficiency and infections in such patients .
they included patients and determined mbl levels as well as mbl genotypes .,conducted a prospective observational study focusing on assessment of mbl as a risk factor for infection during chemotherapyinduced neutropenia in adult hematological cancer patients .
"surprisingly , such association was seen for both donor and recipient haplotypes .","they used a relatively long ( 1 year and more for some patients ) follow - up period and found the presence of the haplotype hya ( in cis with wild type on the other gene , i . e . , genotype encoding higher mbl levels ) to be associated with reduced risk of infection , especially in the period after neutrophil recovery ."
they found that carrying deficiency genotypes ( b / b or b / lxa ) was associated with a higher risk of contracting major bacterial infection ( microbiologically confirmed systemic or disseminated infection ) during the days following the auto - pbsct treatment .,"the patients included non - hodgkin ' s lymphoma ( n = ) , acute myeloid leukemia ( n = ) and acute lymphoid leukemia ( n = ) patients ."
"hopefully , further studies will describe the patients particularly at risk when being mbl deficient .",a critical factor may be the differences in the intensity of the conditioning regimes used ( leading to various levels and duration of neutropenia ) as well as the variations in follow - up periods .
"in some cases , sirs occurs in response to infection and "" sepsis "" is then used to describe the symptoms .",more severely a septic shock may develop with multi organ dysfunctions ( mod ) .
"another carefully conducted study investigated the mbl levels and genotypes in a total of adults ( 197 with sepsis ) prospectively admitted to the icu ( garred et al . , b ) .",no difference was seen between genotype frequencies in patients with sirs as compared to healthy controls .
the patients were divided in high or low mbl haplotype groups .,characterized the mbl genotypes of critically ill caucasians with sirs .
patients are thus at increased risk of infection following major surgery .,the immune defense is compromised by the trauma involved in major operations .
"mbl deficiency appears to play an important role in susceptibility of critical ill patients to the development and progression of sepsis and septic shock , and confers a substantially increased risk of fatal outcome .",there is clearly a need for improvement in defining which patient groups and which clinical data are relevant to examine .
"depending on ethnic groups , type of patients and the symptoms studied associations were seen in some but not in other studies .","studies on associations between mbl deficiency and rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) have been discussed in detail before ( graudal , ; barton et al . , ) and we shall thus not go into detail ."
from the several investigations on mbl and systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) the consensus is emerging that low levels of mbl predisposes to development of the disease .,"certainly , the connection is not like for c1q where sle develops in almost all of the rare cases of deficiency ."
restenosis is often occurring after such a procedure ( in typically % of the patients after the first year ) .,"plaque material may be removed from inside of the carotid artery ( e . g . , by endarterectomy ) to avoid cerebral attack ."
"in a study of heart transplant recipients , fiane et al .",recorded transplant - associated coronary artery disease and observed an association with mbl deficiency ( p = 2 ) .
"found that there were more patients with myocardial infarcts among norwegians with low mbl allotypes than in controls ( relative risk , p = 17 ) .","in a study of patients with severe atherosclerosis , madsen et al ."
the data above suggest that a high mbl geno - and phenotype is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetic kidney disease and that assessing mbl status may prove beneficial in identifying patients at risk for micro - and macro - vascular complications .,"in a prospective - years followup study on type diabetic patients , it was found that for patients with type diabetes and mbl - levels below the median of g / ml the risk of developing micro or macroalbuminuria was %, while the patients with mbl - levels above the median had a risk of % of developing microor macro - albuminuria ( hovind et al . , ) ."
studied a cohort of patients with genital hsv - 2 infection ( symptomatic and asymptomatic ) .,"a higher frequency of mbl - deficient patients was seen in the symptomatic group when compared to the asymptomatic group , suggesting that mbl may be involved in the clearance of hsv - 2 infection ."
we have been interested in the possibility of therapy with mbl in clinical situations .,"an early trial with mbl purified from donor plasma indicated absence of adverse effects ( possibly even beneficial effect ) ( valdimarsson et al . , ) when reconstituting mbl deficient individuals , and the safety of such mbl infusion was born out in a phase i study ( valdimarsson et al . , ) ."
both mbls in mice are able to bind to carbohydrate surfaces and activate the complement system .,the mouse has two genes encoding different mbl molecules ( mbl - a and - c ) compared to one in humans .
"the immune defence is abundant , or redundant , and survival of the individual is ensured by manifold defence mechanisms .","a more subtle , regulatory role of mbl is indicated by the prevalence of mbl deficiency in autoimmune disorders , suggesting new avenues of investigation ."
"practically speaking , in a world of growing mortality heterogeneity , the l - rag age could be used for pension and retirement policy .","the paper also discusses the connection between the proposed l - rag age and the related concept of biological age , from the medical and gerontology literature ."

earlier versions used the phrase biological age instead of the more accurate longevity - risk - adjusted global age .,"finally , the author thanks the ime reviewers as well as participants at longevity in washington ( sep / 2019 ) , georgia state university ( dec / 2019 ) and the aea / assa meetings in san diego ( jan / 2020 ) ."
"at the risk of jumping too far ahead , table displays the bestfitting gompertz ( and makeham ) parameters for the countries listed and available in the human mortality database ( hmd ) at the time this analysis was conducted .","might temporarily break - down during pandemics ( such as , and the upper bound (x > ) is subject to some debate in the bio - demographic literature ."
"age adjustments , which are similar to actuarial setbacks , are a refined form of the underwriting process that has been used by life insurance companies for centuries .","what has received less attention in the insurance literature , however , is how to map estimated mortality rates into a consistent longevity - risk - adjusted global age ."
section provides an overview of the statistical and methodological framework proposed in this paper .,"section gets into the details and the role of the compensation law of mortality , introduced by gavrilov and gavrilova ."
"the difference between the two methodologies or viewpoints is not just a matter of computational technique , but is see the work by payne et al .","generally speaking , there are two very different approaches for how to compute or measure an adjusted ( non - chronological ) age ."
"stated quite simply , in the former ( living ) , the benchmark for measuring true age is other people who are alive , and for the latter ( dying ) approach the benchmark is people who are dead .","although researchers themselves do not use these terms , this paper labels the two approaches a ' ' living ' ' ( i . e . , biological ) methodology and a ' ' dying ' ' ( i . e . , mortality - rate ) methodology ."
"these physiological and molecular variables might then be augmented by physical variables ( i . e . , more easily measured , not requiring a laboratory ) such as hand grip strength , visual perception , or even the number of missing teeth .","some researchers go so far as to augment their dataset with social variables , such as number of friends on facebook , or a binary variable measuring whether they like to garden ."
"variables that are not statistically significant are discarded ( e . g . , facebook friends ) and the multivariate regression is estimated again ( and again ) until the process converges on a small set of variables that relate ( i . e . , predict ) the dependent variable , which is chronological age .","the best - fitting regression equation becomes the formula for biological age , while the individual errors in the regression are the gaps between a person ' s chronological age and their biological age ."
"factors ) , determines whether scoring higher in those elements effectively makes one younger or older .",the statistically - significant coefficients in this regression are declared as relevant biomarkers of aging - and the sign of the coefficients ( a . k . a .
the purpose of longevity - risk - adjusted global age is to better represent and elain time until death relative to the global average .,"this process begins by collecting data on mortality rates ( only ) as a function of chronological age , as well as any other characteristics or elements associated with mortality ."
this is precisely where the gm law of mortality is used .,"in particular , this paper derives the risk - adjusted age by inverting the gm eression , taking as input both global and local mortality rates and then solving for the implied age ."
"the manufactured (x , i ) age is also assumed ( i . e . , forced ) to satisfy a gm - like relationship for the hazard rate , inspired by the thick middle line in fig .","the total hazard rate ( thr ) is : moving on , let (x , i ) denote the ( new ) longevity - risk - adjusted global age for someone at the chronological age of x , in country i ."
"on the other side , the natural ( gompertz ) portion plateaus at chronological age x * , which is a fixed global parameter , at a value of * .","it is the point at which the various country - lines hit the y - axis , if the x - axis is extended leftwards to zero ."
"the third term which differentiates one country from another is g [ i ] , which is the corresponding mgr during the gompertzian range of life x < x * .","note that some countries are estimated to have ( very ) high accidental death rates ( e . g . , males in russia , in table a ) and other countries have negligible ( estimated ) accidental death rate ( e . g . , males in israel , in table ) ."
"a deliberate choice is made to use q x , on top of the brace , and not the natural log of the one - year death rate ln [ q x ] , because q x and x are not the same quantity .",which is the standard linear representation of ( log ) total hazard minus accidental death rates for all ages within the gm regime .
"note that by definition : ln [ 1 q x ] > , so one can subtract the accidental death ( makeham ) rate from both sides of the above eression , take logs ( again ) and obtain a linear relationship between the ( transformed value of the ) one - year decrement q x and chronological age x .",the relationship can be written elicitly for each of the groups as :
"using that formulation , the total hazard rate x is eressed as : + ( 1 / b ) e (x m ) / b .","as noted in the introduction , researchers in actuarial finance ( and in particular the annuity literature ) might be more accustomed to the probabilistic formulation of the gompertz - makeham law in terms of the modal value m and dispersion coefficient b of the remaining lifetime random variable ."
back to the computation of longevity - riskadjusted age : the next step is to compute population averages,"we now have a set of diverse gm parameters as well as ( one , global pair ) ( * , x * ) ."
"after dividing both sides of the above equation by * > , the relevant equality can be re - written as :","the objective now is to isolate (x , i ) as a function of the ( estimated ) country - specific and global parameters ."
"this eression is valid as long as the left - hand side is positive which ( it is , and ) will be justified in a moment .","this then leads to the following eression for as a function of x , and the key parameters :"
"this might seem odd at first , but is driven by the compensation law of mortality which underlies eq .","indeed , it is worth emphasizing that when the value of [ i ] > , aging for that group ( i . e . , country ) is faster than average ( g [ i ] > g ) , and yet the longevity - risk - adjusted global age , (x , i ) is lower than chronological age , x ."
"rather , the current framework focuses on measuring risk - adjusted ages relative to some global benchmark at a single point in time , as opposed to forecasting how it evolves over time and whether or not it is stochastic .","on a related note this paper is silent on the issue of forwardlooking stochastic mortality , and how longevity - risk - adjusted global age and the underlying mortality rates evolve over time , as per lee - carter for example ."
"for example , sciencedaily , in an issue dated march , reported on research published in the lancet public health , which showed a - year - gap separating countries with the highest and lowest ages at which people eerience the health problems of a global - year - old .",that procedure is ( technically ) the opposite of the algorithm in this paper .
"compare this - again , with a behavioral framework in mind - to informing said person that their life eectancy is actually years , versus the population average of , and they should therefore wait to draw their pension .","assuming a speciesspecific lifespan of x * = , an average mortality growth rate of % and a mortality plateau * = e , we can say the following : arguably , notifying a - year - old that their ( true ) age is might help them take action , such as delaying retirement ."
"this study investigated antimicrobial resistance traits , clonal relationships and epidemiology of histophilus somni isolated from clinically affected cattle in queensland and new south wales , australia .","isolates ( n = ) were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing against six antimicrobial agents ( ceftiofur , enrofloxacin , florfenicol , tetracycline , tilmicosin and tulathromycin ) using disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration ( mic ) assays ."
an additional aim of this study was to assess associations between epidemiological factors ( e . g .,"state of origin , production type , site of isolation ) , clonal relationships and antimicrobial susceptibility of h . somni cultured from australian cattle ."
"isolates were derived from cattle with clinical signs of respiratory disease ( n = ) , thrombotic meningoencephalitis ( n = ) or infertility ( n = ) and h . somni was considered to be the causal or a contributing pathogen .","isolates were recovered from lung samples ( 37 / 53 , %) , nasal swabs ( 6 / 53 , %) , brain swabs ( 3 / 53 , %) and one each from a pleural swab , preputial swab and heart blood swab ; the remaining four (8 % ) isolates were from unspecified sites ."
"since guidelines for tilmicosin were not available for h . somni , interpretation was based on guidelines for mannheimia haemolytica ( blackall et al . , ) .","disc diffusion susceptibility testing was also performed for tetracycline ( 30 g ) , although clsi guidelines were not available for interpretation of these results ."
"the mics of ceftiofur , enrofloxacin , florfenicol , tetracycline , and tilmicosin were determined according to clsi guidelines for agar dilution ( clinical laboratory standards institute , ) .","the mics of tulathromycin were determined for only isolates using the same guidelines , since there were delays in obtaining tulathromycin antimicrobial powder and isolates could not be revived for testing ."
"within each cluster , isolates with a similarity of > 94% were considered to be a clonal group .",a cluster was defined as a group of isolates that shared % similarity in their eric - pcr patterns .
"mics , percentages of resistance to each antimicrobial agent , and mic50 and mic90 values are shown in table .","one of ( 2% ) isolates was resistant to tetracycline , with an mic of g / ml , while all other isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested ."
"seven isolates had intermediate susceptibility to tilmicosin by disc diffusion , with zone diameters of - 13 mm ( intermediate breakpoints - 13 mm ) ; these isolates had mic values of - 8 g / ml ( susceptible breakpoint g / ml ) .",the one resistant isolate had a zone diameter of mm ( resistant breakpoint mm ) and a corresponding mic of g / ml .
the present study demonstrated that resistance against six antimicrobial agents in h . somni cultured from australian cattle is either absent or extremely low .,"studies on brd pathogens throughout the world , including denmark ( aarestrup et al . , ) , australia ( blackall et al . , ) , north america ( portis et al . , ) , japan ( katsuda et al . , ) and canada ( d ' amours et al . , ) , show that resistance to antimicrobial agents is increasing ."
"this study utilised two widely accepted methods , disc diffusion and mic , for determining antimicrobial susceptibility in h . somni isolates .","the results of the two tests for tilmicosin and tulathromycin were not comparable for all isolates , since a small number of isolates had intermediate susceptibility or resistant zone sizes on disc diffusion which were determined to be susceptible by the mic method ."
"however , a later study from north america identified a decrease in the susceptibility of h . somni to both tilmicosin and tulathromycin over time ( portis et al . , ) .","one year prior to registration of tulathromycin in northern america in , - 6% of brd pathogens exhibited resistance and , by , only % of h . somni remained susceptible ( portis et al . , ) ."
"tetracycline resistance has not previously been reported in australian isolates of h . somni ; however , with the detection of a highly resistant isolate in the present study ( isolated in ) , tetracycline susceptibility in h . somni should be closely monitored .",", who observed a decrease in tetracycline susceptibility from % of isolates in to % in ."
data were limited to histories provided at the time of submission .,"isolates were from diagnostic samples and therefore were submitted at the discretion of veterinary practitioners , and thus may not be representative of h . somni in the wider population of cattle ."
this study demonstrated that most isolates of h . somni from cattle in queensland and new south wales are susceptible to antimicrobial agents that are most frequently used to treat brd .,"mic and disc diffusion data were generally comparable , with the exception of tilmicosin and tulathromycin ."
"given the significant overlap between cardiology and critical care , cardiologists may be among the first physicians asked to step in to fill this shortage .","if and when this occurs , a basic framework for recognition of acute respiratory failure , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) , and initial ventilator management is imperative ."
oxygen therapy was utilized in % of patients and infection required mechanical ventilation in % of those infected .,"the incidence has been even higher in the italian series , with up to % of infected patients in lombardy developing ards ."
""" institution - specific policies should guide the decision for use of noninvasive ventilation versus early endotracheal intubation in this population .","given concern for viral transmission , current recommendations advise "" caution when using highflow nasal oxygen or noninvasive ventilation due to risk of dispersion of aerosolized virus in the healthcare environment with poorly fitting masks ."
this is a polyvinylchloride tube that is placed between the vocal cords and into the trachea .,"in the intensive care unit , most patients undergoing mechanical ventilation will have an endotracheal tube ( ett ) in place ."
"after placement of the ett , auscultation for bilateral breath sounds is imperative .","on chest radiography , the distal end of the endotracheal tube should be cm above the level of the carina to ensure correct placement ."
"no compelling data exist to support the use of one mode over another , suggesting the nonintensivist physician should utilize whichever mode he or she is most familiar .","assist - control is more typically used at the onset of respiratory failure , as it is more likely to relieve the patient from respiratory work ."
pulmonary compliance is defined as the change in volume over inspiration ( tidal volume delivered ) divided by the change in pressure from end - inspiration to end - eiration ( plateau pressuretotal peep ) .,"when using a pressure - control mode of ventilation , a given amount of positive pressure is introduced into the lungs and the delivered tidal volume then depends on the lung compliance ."
it is advisable to reference the widely - published ardsnet protocol for guidance in determining appropriate peep for a given fio .,decisions regarding a lower versus higher peep strategy may be tailored based on underlying cardiac physiology .
plateau pressure is measured after a to - second inspiratory pause maneuver .,"if the plateau pressure is > - cm h o , consider further reducing the delivered tidal volume ."
one of the few bright spots in this pandemic has been the resurgence of interdisciplinary teamworkwe are all in this together .,"as many of us prepare to utilize skillsets long forgotten , it will be important to remember to ask for help when needed ."
those results were confirmed by immunohistochemistry with a polyclonal anti - o78 and a monoclonal anti - f17b antisera .,"three of the five control calves receiving either saline or a cnf , f17a strain ( 2 5 kh09 ) had no clinical signs or lesions ."

de rycke and plassiart ( 1 9 9 0 b ) investigated the effect in young lambs of intravenous injection of a partially purified preparation of cnf1 .,"all the lambs developed severe clinical signs starting h after inoculation , which consisted mainly in neurological signs and mucoid diarrhoea ."
"in addition , many ntec2 strains have been isolated from healthy animals ( pohl et al . , ; blanco et al . , ) showing the need for the development of a controlled model in calves .","since the eeriments of smith with an ovine vir e . coli strain , no eerimental evidence has been reported on the involvement of ntec2 strains or the role of cnf2 in diseases in calves ."
"they were kept one after the other in a clean stall disinfected each time with atlantol ( eco . sa , ghent , belgium ) .",they received ml of colostrum during the first hour of life and were then fed with commercial uht - sterilised full cream milk twice a day .
the totality of the suspension ( 250 ml ) was orally administrated to the calves using a sterile bottle with a teat .,"serial dilutions of the inoculum were plated onto gassner - agar plates ( merck , darmstadt , germany ) with a spiral plater ( don whitley scientific ltd . , shipley , west yorkshire , uk ) and incubated overnight at c to verify the number of bacteria inoculated ."

"tissues were fixed in a phosphate - buffered formaldehyde / glutaraldehyde solution ( 4 / 1 , v / v ) , processed routinely , paraffin - embedded and sections of mm were obtained .",tissue sections were then stained with hematoxylin - eosin ( he ) and examined for presence of bacteria and inflammatory lesions .
"in addition , the proportion of the challenge strains among lactose - fermenting colonies was estimated quantitatively by colony hybridisation of a plate with radioactive probes for cnf2 ( oswald et al . , b ) , f17 ( lintermans et al . , b ) or k99 ( mainil et al . , ) as described below .","the presence of coliforms in extra - intestinal tissues , nasal secretions , oral secretions , urine and heart blood was estimated qualitatively : a tissue sample or a drop was directly plated onto gassner - agar and colombia with % sheep blood - agar plates ( becton - dickinson , meylan , france ) ."
"whatman paper filters ( whatman international ltd . , maidstone , england ) were placed onto colonies after overnight growth on gassner - agar plates as elained before .","after h , the paper filters were peeled off and treated with the following solutions : % sodium dodecyl - sulphate ( sds ) for min ; m naoh / 1.5 m nacl ( ph ) for min and m tris / 1.5 m nacl ( ph ) for min , allowed to dry and hybridised overnight at c with the dna probes for cnf2 , f17 or k99 ( mainil et al . , ) ."
the gel was processed by using the chef mapper apparatus ( biorad ) .,"after h , the supernatant was removed and replaced by ml of edta m . the plugs were then loaded into the wells of a % pulsed - field certified agarose gel ( biorad ) in x tbe buffer ( biorad ) ."
the diarrhoea persisted until euthanasia of the first calf but disappeared after h for the other two ( table ) .,the inoculation at h of age was followed by the appearance of some diarrhoea between and hpi .
"five calves ( c7 , c8 , c9 , c10 and c14 ) showed apathy , anorexia and dehydration , two ( c8 and c14 ) respiratory distress and one ( c7 ) was dying at the time of euthanasia .","eight of the eleven calves inoculated with the ntec2 strains ( 1404 , b20a ) at h of age presented watery diarrhoea , which appeared between and hpi and persisted until euthanasia ( table ) ."
they appeared clinically healthy and behaved normally ( table ) .,"on the other hand , a profuse liquid diarrhoea was observed in the other two control calves ( c4 , c5 ) which persisted until euthanasia ."
strain kh09 was recovered from the faeces from hpi until euthanasia ( table ) .,the numbers of the ntec2 strains present in the faeces as well as their proportion among e . coli were highly variable and were not correlated to the severity of clinical signs ( tables and ) .
"all inoculated calves were negative for the presence of cryptosporidiae , k99 e . coli and salmonellae ; only calf c12 was positive for the presence of rotavirus and coronavirus ( data not shown ) .","on the other hand , the two non - inoculated calves with diarrhoea ( c4 and c5 ) were positive for the presence of k99 e . coli ."
"at necropsy , all calves inoculated with the ntec2 strains had lesions of vascular congestion and thickening of the intestinal mucosa in all parts of the small intestine ( which were more pronounced in the jejunum and ileum ) , and hypertrophy of the associated mln .",petechial haemorrhages were present in the hearts of c7 and c12 and c12 also had lesions of fibrinous arthritis in the hocks .
"the crypts were necrosed in the colon of the calves c6 , c11 , c12 , c4 and c5 .",the caecum and the colon of these calves also showed congestion and infiltration of inflammatory cells ( lymphocytes and neutrophils ) in the mucosa of all calves and in the submucosa and tunica muscularis of calves c4 and c5 .
"the ntec2 challenge strains were also recovered in pure culture from the heart blood , the lungs and / or the liver of the same calves , but not from the kidneys , the spleen or the mln ( table ) .","on the other hand , the ntec2 challenge strains were not recovered from the intestine of calves c1 , c2 , c3 , c5 , c6 and c12 ( table ) , neither from their internal organs ( table ) ."
"in the same way , a k99 e . coli was also recovered in high numbers from the intestine of calves c4 and c5 ( table ) but not from their internal organs ( table ) .",e . coli kh09 was also recovered in high numbers from the various parts of the intestine of calf c3 ( table ) but not from its internal organs ( table ) .
positive hybridisation results were observed in the intestine of calves c7 and c14 .,bacteria were associated with the intestinal content or with the epithelial cells of the intestinal villi ( fig .
"however , no correlation was observed between the severity of the diarrhoea and the degree of excretion of the challenge strain .","in eight calves out of eleven inoculated at h of age ( calves c7 , c8 , c9 , c10 , c11 , c13 , c14 and c27 ) , diarrhoea persisted until the time of euthanasia and was correlated with the excretion of high numbers of the challenge strain in the faeces ( tables - 3 ) and with its presence in the intestinal content at necropsy ( table ) ."
"the invasive character seem to be a specific property of the ntec2 strains , as testified by the absence of strains kh09 and of contaminating k99 e . coli in internal organs of calves c3 to c5 , although not an exclusive one since non - ntec e . coli were also isolated from internal organs of three calves ( c5 , c6 , and c12 ) .","these observations are in general agreement with observations in piglets inoculated with ntec1 strains , showing the predilection for the lung associated in some cases with diarrhoea , respiratory signs and death ( wray et al . , ; fournout et al . , ; clement et al . , results not published ) ."
the lesions were more severe in the small intestine than in the large intestine .,"surprisingly , few bacteria were observed by light microscopy and those that were detected were associated with the intestinal epithelium or with the mucus mainly ."
"the diarrhoea observed and the excretion of the challenge strain did not last long in three additional calves inoculated at h of age with strain b20a ( c5 and c6 ) or ( c12 ) nor in three calves inoculated at h of age with strain ( c1 , c2 and c3 ) .","in addition , the challenge strain was not recovered at necropsy either from the intestinal content or from extra - intestinal sites ."
"the mechanism of passage of the ntec2 strains through the intestinal wall is unknown , but it is tempting to speculate on a role for the cnf2 toxin , since ntec2 are seen in close association with enterocytes and since the effect of the toxin on cultivated epithelial cells is a reorganisation of the f - actin cytoskeleton ( oswald et al . , a ) .","actin cytoskeleton rearrangement is indeed a mean for a non - invasive bacteria to be internalised into epithelial cells ( falzano et al . , ) ."
"moreover , those strains are able to invade the blood stream , most probably after crossing the intestinal wall , and to localise in the internal organs .","according to the results obtained so far , ntec2 strains are able to colonise the intestine and to cause persistent diarrhoea in ' ' colostrum - restricted ' ' conventional newborn calves ."
"however , it must be emphasised that restriction of colostrum , age at the time of inoculation and absence of other invasive e . coli appear to enhance the ability of the ntec2 to colonise the gut and invade the blood stream .","ntec2 may thus , represent opportunistic pathogens waiting for favourable circumstances ( like newborn ) , a consideration which in no way diminishes their virulence potential once the circumstances are present ."
"however , further investigations are needed , particularly focusing on the relationship between pi and specific enteropathogen infections in calves .","in this study , the pi level influenced the occurrence of enteric diseases and mortality in calves under one month of age , confirming the importance of a proper colostrum provision to calf health and , consequently , to the reduction of antimicrobial use in dairy farming ."
"calves that survive to diarrhea usually show lower growth rates and are more susceptible to other diseases ( especially bovine respiratory disease comple with the possibility of long - term negative consequences on performances in the first lactation ( curtis et al . , ; donovan et al . , a ; van der fels - klerx et al . , ) .","in this period , calves suffer mainly from enteric diseases caused by infectious pathogens like escherichia coli , rotavirus , coronavirus , and cryptosporidium parvum ( maunsell and donovan , ; mcguirk , ) ."
"additionally , the veterinarian collected fecal samples into a ml tube from the rectum of those calves that both showed signs of clinical diarrhea ( i . e . , profuse liquid feces ) and had not been treated yet at the time of the farm visit .","the health of the enrolled calves was monitored at each farm visit from birth to days of age , and data on disease and mortality occurrence ( i . e . , type of disease , cause of mortality , age at disease onset or mortality occurrence , and antibiotic treatments on sick calves ) were recorded ."
"elisa when evaluated against other three diagnostic techniques ( another eisa test , an immunofluorescence assay , and an immunochromatographic assay ) ( geurden et al . , ) .","the sensitivity and specificity of the tests reported in literature were % and % for rotavirus elisa and % and % for coronavirus elisa when compared with lateral flow immunochromatography ( izzo et al . , ) , % and % for e . coli k99 elisa when tested against pcr ( izzo et al . , ) , and % and % for cryptosporidium spp ."
"particularly , an exact logistic regression was performed for mortality , due to the low number of occurrence .","the effect of ftpi , considered as predictive factor , on disease and mortality occurrence , antibiotic treatments for sick calves , and specific enteropathogen infections was investigated by proc logistic ( sas institute inc . , cary , nc ) , including the farm in the model ."
even if no specific indicators of calf diarrhea severity were measured in this study ( e . g .,"dehydration , body temperature , fecal scoring ) , the tendency of having a lower ig concentration observed in sick calves that needed antibiotic treatments ( 25.6% of the overall sick calves ) compared to those that were not treated ( lsm sem : vs g / l ; p = . 127 ) reasonably suggested a greater severity of the disease in calves with lower pi levels ."
"moreover , the onset of diarrhea was delayed by about days in calves with an adequate pi transfer compared to those with ftpi ( mean standard error : vs days ; p < . 01 ) .","; wilcon test of equality over strata : = 7 ; p < . 01 ) , with a higher hazard of becoming sick over the time for calves with ftpi than for those with an adequate pi transfer ( hazard ratio = ; % ci = 2-3.98 ) ."
"particularly , out of the fecal samples that were collected from the calves with scours , ( 46.4% ) were positive only to cryptosporidium spp . , five ( 17.9% ) were positive only to rotavirus , four ( 14.3% ) were positive to more than one infectious pathogen ( two to rotavirus and cryptosporidium spp . , one to rotavirus and coronavirus , and one to e . coli , rotavirus and cryptosporidium spp .",") , and six ( 21.4% ) were negative to all the tested enteropathogens ."
"in this study , an adequate pi transfer was protective also against infections by specific enteropathogens like rotavirus and cryptosporidium spp .","however , due to the small dataset referred to the specific enteropathogen infections available in this study , further in - depth investigations are needed to confirm the latter results ."
"there are six mammalian arf proteins that can be divided into three classes based on sequence homology : class i ( arf1 , arf2 and arf3 ) , class ii ( arf4 and arf5 ) and class iii ( arf6 ) ( fig .","arfs have several important functions , including the recruitment of coat proteins that promote sorting of cargo into vesicles , the recruitment and activation of enzymes , such as the phosphatidylinositol ( ptdins ) kinases , that alter membrane lipid composition , and interaction with cytoskeletal factors ( table ) ."
"some arl proteins , including arl1 , arl2 and arf - related protein ( arfrp1 ) , are ancient and have homologues in plants , yeast and metazoans , whereas others , such as arl11 , arose later in evolution and are present only in vertebrates .","in addition , there are over arf - like ( arl ) proteins , which seem to have broader roles than arfs ."
"the arf guanine nucleotid e exchange factors ( gefs ) contain a conserved sec7 domain that catalyses gdp release from , and gtp binding to , their substrate arfs .",the study of arf protein function was aided greatly by the early discovery of the regulators of arf gtp binding and gtp hydrolysis .
"new roles of arf and arl proteins are emerging , including novel functions at the golgi complex and in cilia formation .","their function is under tight spatial control , which is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( gefs ) and gtpase - activating proteins ( gaps ) that catalyse gtp exchange and hydrolysis , respectively ."
"proteins that promote the release of gdp from guanin e - nucleotide - binding ( g ) proteins , which allows gtp to bind .",these proteins often stabilize the nucleotide - free form and then are released upon gtp binding .
we see evidence of arf proteins acting in pairs or in series in the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) - golgi system and at the plasma membrane .,"in this review , we emphasize how arf proteins function as a network in which the arf regulators participate ."
"how gefs and gaps can act as scaffolds , both as effectors and in initiating signalling responses , and describe how they participate in development and disease .","the reader is referred to two excellent prior reviews : one deals comprehensively with arf1 and arf6 function and the other more broadly with arf , arl , gef and gap proteins ."
"unlike for rab and rho g proteins , no gdp dissociation inhibitor ( gdi ) proteins have been identified for arfs or arls .","in sar1 , the n - terminal amphipathic helix binds directly to membrane s and induces membrane curvature ."
"c | arf family g proteins undergo a cycle of gtp binding and hydrolysis , mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( gefs ) and gtpase - activating proteins ( gaps ) , respectively .","the gtp - bound form is thought to carry out g protein functions through interaction with ' classical effectors ' , including vesicle coat proteins and enzymes that can modify membrane lipid composition ; however , increased attention has focused on networks of effectors that are targeted by proteins that interact with gefs and gaps themselves and unique effectors that associate specifically with the gdp - bound form of arf proteins ."
"arf3 , but not arf1 , becomes cytosolic at o c , the temperature at which exit from the tgn is blocked .","thus , arf3 might have an additional crucial role during exit from the golgi ."
"this ciliary targeting complex includes , in addition to arf4 , rab11 , fip3 ( a shared arf and rab11 effector ) and asap1 ( arf gap containing sh3 , ankyrin repeat and ph domains ) .","exactly how this complex facilitates the packaging of rhodopsin into post - golgi carriers has yet to be determined but , interestingly , rhodopsin itself initiates complex formation by recruiting arf4 ."
"nevertheless , only the gbf and big subfamilies of arf guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( gefs ) seem to be present in plants , and these function in both endocytic and golgi trafficking pathways .","a . thaliana gnom ( also known as emb30 ) is a homologue of mammalian gbf1 but acts at endosomes and the plasma membrane during the polar transport of the plant hormone auxin during development , ."
a . thaliana arf gaps include four members of a family of mammalian acap homologues that are known as vascular network ( van3 ) - like after the first member to be characterized .,"van3 ( also known as scarface and agd3 ) regulates formation of plant vascular networks , ."
"another arf family membe r , arfrp1 , is highly eressed in adipocytes , and mice that lack arfrp1 in adipose tissue show severe defects in lipid storage and enhanced lipolysis .","finally , in some cell types arf1 at the plasma membrane affects endocytosis of proteins anchored to the membrane by a glyco syl ptdins ( gpi ) linkage ."
"a great deal of work on arf6 function has been summarized in a pre vious review , so here we focus on more recent advances .","in mammals , arf6 is not required for early embryonic development , but arf6 - knockout mice die at and arf4 localize to the early cis - golgi and arf3 specifically localizes to the trans - golgi network ( tgn ) ."
"at the plasma membrane , arf6 changes the membrane lipid composition through activation of ptdins4p5k and pld , resulting in the generation of ptdinsp and phosphatidic acid .","these lipids are important for sorting proteins within the membrane , for the formation of clathrin - coated pits during endocytosis , and for the recruitment and activation of rho family g proteins , such as rac , to alter actin poly merization ."
a complex of proteins that facilitates membrane traffic into the cilium .,mutant forms of several bbs components have been identified as causative agents for various ciliopathies .
"hence , depending on the signalling complex assembled , either formation or dis assembly of adherens junctions can be achieved through activation of arf6 .",there is also some evidence that the arf6 gef efa6 affects tight - junction assembly .
"bbsome subunits have ' coat - like ' attributes and simila r structural folds to those found in copi and adaptor protein complexes , suggesting that the bbsome can sort specific cargo for transport ( fig .","transport of membrane proteins into the cilium is driven by a complex of proteins , called the bbsome ."

"a great deal of progress has been made in identifying arf gefs , and an uneectedly broad range of roles has been revealed for these regulators , including both the coordination of membrane trafficking with lipid homeostasis and signalling at the plasma membrane ( table ) .","because gefs ensure the precise temporal and spatial activation of arfs , their own localization mechanisms are crucial for understanding their cellular roles ."
"a ) , where it controls transport of membrane proteins through the secretory pathway .",the activity of phosphodiesterase a is important for recruitment of big1 and big2 to the trans - golgi .
"in enteroviral systems , gbf1 and ptdins4kiii are recruited coordinately to membranes by the viral a protein to promote formation of functional viral replication complexes near er exit sites ( fig .","gbf1 is required for the replication of numerous viruses , including enteroviruses , hepatitis c virus and corona viruses ."
"yel1 is an efa6 - like gef for the arf6 orthologue arf3 in yeast , and localizes to the plasma membrane of the emerging bud .","similarly to its mammalian orthologues , the ph domain of yel1 is required for membrane targeting but , interestingly , multiple regions of the protein are important for precise spatial localization of this gef ."
"brag2 , an arf6 gef , also has a ph domain that is critical for membrane targeting and in breast cancer cells is specifically recruited to the egf receptor upon egf stimulation , through direct interaction of its ph domain with the egf receptor .",this interaction requires phosphorylation on specific tyr residues and thus the recruitment of brag2 couples receptor activation to arf6 activation .
"indeed , such a loop has been demonstrated in vitro for arf1 ( ref .","the activation of cytohesins by a gtp - bound arf family member raises the question of whether they can engage in a positive feedback loop , whereby the substrate itself can stimulate further exchange ."
cells eressing constitutively active arf6q67l have increased levels of arf1 gtp .,"arf1 affects several processes at the plasma membrane , including recruitment of proteins to focal adhesions and during phagocytosis ."
"interestingly , assembly of this scaffolding complex promotes rac activation and cell migration , indicating that these scaffolds assemble a signalling complex that determines a specific downstream output upon arf activation .","other scaffolding proteins interact with the coiled - coil domain of cytohesin ; these proteins include golgi reassembly - stacking protein ( grasp ) and ipcef ( interactor protein for cytohesin exchange factor s ) , which mediate the interaction of dock180 with cytohesin ."
"eeriments in isolated hippocampal neurons indicate that arf6 , efa6 and the cytohesins might affect neurite and dendritic spine development , .","levels of arf6 and the efa6 and cytohesin family gefs markedly increase in the mammalian brain after birth , suggesting important roles in postnatal nervous system development ."
"before recruitment , the sec7 catalytic gef domain , the pleckstrin homology ( ph ) domain and the carboxy - terminal - helix of cytohesin are in an autoinhibited conformation ( left ) , with the c - terminal - helix ( charged residues within this are shown as ' + ' ) and linker situated between the catalytic sec7 domain and the ph domain , which blocks the arf - binding site .","upon binding of the ph domain to the gtp - bound gef at the membrane , the catalytic site is released from autoinhibition ( right ) ."
disease alleles include an early frameshift mutation that deletes most of the big2 protein .,defect in vesicular trafficking that alters the adhesive properties of these neurons .
"egf receptors ( egfrs ) undergo ligand - induced dimerization and subsequent transphosphorylation , mediated by conformational changes in their cytoplasmic portion .",cytohesins bind directly to these cytoplasmic domains and promote conformational changes that increase phosphorylation .
"arfgap1 , the first arf gap to be cloned , is golgilocalized and , together with arfgap2 and arfgap3 , mediates most arf - bound gtp hydrolysis at the golgi .","the complex , multidomain structure of the other arf gap families has stimulated much research ."
"asap1 resides in focal adhesions but , in response to src activation , it facilitates formation of podosomes , which are discrete actin - based structures that are formed at the cell substratum to degrade matrix .","the asap proteins are the prototypical multidomain gaps that interact with many signalling molecules , including src and focal adhesion kinase ( table ) ."
"among the proteins interacting with git1 are the cdc42 and rac gef pix , focal adhesion kinase and paxillin .","git1 , similarly to asap1 , is sometimes observed in focal adhesions and its influence on the activation of cdc42 and rac suggests that arf inactivation and rac activation are coordinated ( fig ."
future studies on how arf family proteins function will therefore require in vitro reconstitution on model membranes .,"there appears to be a particularly important link between arf1 function and ptdins4p , a lipid that has a central role in the function of the golgi , which parallels the coordination of membrane trafficking and ptdins p signalling by arf6 at the plasma membrane ."
"the role of arf6 in networks linking membrane trafficking to the actin cytoskeleton also involves interaction of arf6 with gefs and gaps of the rac and rho small g proteins , actin cytoskeleton regulators .",another emerging concept is that some arf family members remain membrane - bound in their gdp - bound form so that they can interact with signalling complexes and promote alternative signalling pathways .
"hence , increased understanding of arls and their regulators should inform both fundamental questions in cell biology and disease mechanisms .","several arl proteins affect ciliogenesis and , in some cases , ciliopathies ; other arls function in neurons and have been associated with neurodegenerative disorders ."
"finally , the use of model organisms to complement studies in mammalian cells has already provided valuable insights into the physiological roles of arf family proteins .","this approach holds great promise for uncovering the unknown functions of most arls , as well as defining the full range of activities of all arf and arl proteins ."
"to further map antigenic sites , neutralization escape mutants of bcv were selected with a group a mab which has both in vitro and in vivo virus - neutralizing ability .",the escape mutants were demonstrated to be neutralization resistant to the selecting group a mab and remained sensitive to neutralization by a group b mab .
"bcv has also been associated with bovine respiratory disease , which is observed with the most severity in feedlot cattle .","an enteropathogenic virus , bcv causes severe diarrhea in neonatal calves and winter dysentery in adult cattle ."
"the s protein has several important functions including binding of the virus to susceptible cells , mediation of membrane fusion ( both viruscell and cell - cell fusion ) , and induction of neutralizing antibody responses in the host species .","for bcv , the s protein is cleaved at amino acid positions and to form two subunits : s1 represents the n - terminal half of the s protein and s2 represents the c - terminal half of the protein ."
"thus , antigenic site a of the bcv s protein appears to have an important function in the host species .","while both group a and group b mabs neutralize bcv in vitro ( in cell culture ) , only group a mabs demonstrate in vivo virus - neutralizing protective responses in bovine intestinal - loop studies ."
"since this is in general agreement with the proposed location of the k - molecularweight trypsin fragment , amino acids residues to ( domain i ) and to ( domain ii ) are thought to contain the critical amino acids of these epitopes .",deletion mapping studies have identified that both group a and group b conformational epitopes consist of two domains located within amino acid residues to and to .
the quebec strain of bcv was propagated in mardin - darby bovine kidney ( mdbk ) cells .,"mdbk cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with % fetal bovine serum ( cansera , reale , ontario , canada ) ."
"the pcr was performed in a thermocycler ( tyler instrument , edmonton , alberta , canada ) for cycles with the following parameters : c for s for denaturation , c for s for annealing , and c for min for extension , followed by a - min elongation at c after the final cycle .","for pcr , l of the first - strand cdna reaction mixture was added to the pcr mixture containing a final concentration of 5 g of the upstream and downstream primers , mm tris - hcl ( ph ) , mm mgcl , mm kcl , each deoxynucleoside triphosphate at a concentration of mm , and u of vent dna polymerase ( new england biolabs , beverly , mass ) ."

"in contrast , the titer of wild - type bcv was reduced by greater than , 000 - fold after incubation with mab hb10 - 4 .",all of these viable viruses were of the mab - resistant ( mar ) phenotype and after incubation with a : 100 dilution of mab hb10 - 4 had titers which were within - fold of the titers obtained without mab .
"all four viruses remained resistant to mab hb10 - 4 , and all were efficiently neutralized with bb7 - 14 ( a : 200 dilution of the ascitic fluid completely neutralized pfu of each mutant ) .",this indicated that the mutation that affected antigenic site a did not affect the integrity of antigenic site b .
"to minimize misincorporation rates which might occur during the pcr cloning step , a dna polymerase containing a proofreading activity was used throughout the pcr eeriments .","to identify the change in sequence responsible for the loss of immune reactivity with mab hb10 - 4 , a portion of the s1 gene of the mar mutants was cloned and sequenced ."
"thus , the alanine - to - valine change may have caused a local or a more extensive disruption in the s1 structure , causing it to be no longer recognized by mab hb10 - 4 .","changes of alanine to the small amino acids glycine , serine , threonine , and proline occur more frequently ."
"similarly , mhv has deletions of amino acids within the same region .","in contrast , mhv and the rat coronavirus sialodacryoadenitis virus have only minor deletions of and amino acids , respectively , in this region ."
"for mhv jhm and mhv , two highly neurotropic viruses which produce acute fatal encephalitis in mice , large deletions and single or multiple point mutations are observed in this region for viral mutants with reduced neurovirulence .","the hypervariable region appears to be biologically significant in mhv , and studies have indicated that it acts as a pathogenic determinant ."
"in contrast , for the enteropathic transmissible enteritis coronavirus ( tgev ) of swine , the cellular receptor binding region occurs in the location on the s protein that corresponds to the hypervariable region of mhv and enteric tropism determinants occur in the n - terminal region .","respiratory porcine coronaviruses , which are nonenteropathic variants of tgev , demonstrate large amino acid deletions in the n - terminal region of the s protein ."
"although s1 gene sequences appear to be highly conserved among strains and isolates of bcv and sequence deletions or insertions have not been observed , a polymorphic region in the gene is apparent .","lowlevel cell culture - passaged clinical isolates recovered from diarrheic calves show sequence differences which cluster in the region representing amino acid positions to , which corresponds to the mhv hypervariable region ."
our analysis of the region for respiratory and enteric bcvs reveals that only three amino acid changes occur consistently between the two groups ; two of these are conservative substitutions at amino acid positions and ( serine and threonine are interchanged ) .,"the third change , a nonconservative change between groups , occurs very close to critical residue identified in this study at amino acid position , where an aspartic acid or asparagine residue occurs in enteric bcv isolates and a glycine occurs in respiratory bcv isolates ."
"sequence differences between respiratory and enteric bcv isolates suggest that tropism determinants may occur in the polymorphic region , perhaps involving residue , or in the n - terminal region of the s protein .","the polymorphic region from amino acids to may be involved in receptor binding , as in tgev , or may be a pathological determinant like mhv ."
"the human lung is eed daily to over , 000 liters of inspired , ambient air and the continuous aspiration of small amounts of nasopharyngeal secretions during sleep ( kikuchi et al . , ) .","depending on the quality of air in the environment or the resident flora in the nasopharynx , the respiratory tree faces the enormous task of oxygenating blood across a moist , thin alveolar - capillary wall ( approximately pm ) and yet resisting infection ."
"the lung , as is true of other epithelial surfaces that interface with the environment , has developed several strategies to avoid infection .","as an important component ofthese strategies , the host must be able to downregulate both nonspecific and immune - mediated inflammation ."
"thus , the desire to enhance protective pulmonary immune responses by vaccination and to prevent or control unwanted responses underlie the need to study basic immune mechanisms in the lung .","furthermore , understanding critical immunoregulatory mechanisms may lead to strategies for preventing and controlling lung transplant rejection and immune - mediated lung damage in bone marrow transplant patients ."
"the goal of this chapter is to describe the cells and structures of the lung that participate in pulmonary immunity and to summarize studies that help elain how the lung responds to challenges with foreign antigens , with particular emphasis on animal models that have been developed to elore these issues .","features of the immune apparatus that are unique to the lung will be highlighted , and important questions currently under investigation will be indicated ."
many investigations have considered the lung in the broader context of mucosal immunity .,"this conceptual framework is useful , but the respiratory tract has several distinctive features that require that initiation and eression of lung immunity be considered separately from immune responses at other mucosal sites ."
"for internal organs , the concept of a common mucosal system was developed based on evidence that immune lymphocytes generated at one surface migrated to both homologous and distant mucosal sites ( mcdermott and bienenstock , ; mcghee et al . , ) .","we will return to this concept shortly , but in addition to this concept , the lung must be understood immunologically from the point of view that both an upper and lower respiratory tract system exist ( kaltreider , ; kazmierowski et al . , ) , and each system exhibits distinctive as well as common immune mechanisms ."
"a pseudo stratified to single layered columnar epithelium covers vascularized connective tissue , the lamina propria , which , depending on the level of the airway , also contains variable numbers of mucous glands , smooth muscle , and , in the larger airways , is bounded by cartilage .","by contrast , in the lower respiratory tract ( which by definition includes the alveolar ducts and alveoli ) , the epithelium is markedly attenuated and frequently separated from the pulmonary capillary endothelium by only a fused basement membrane ."
other important features of the upper versus lower tract involve the relative importance of iga as the protective antibody .,"thus , igasecreting b cells occur in the mucosa of the upper tract , and iga is the major immunoglobulin in secretions of the upper respiratory tract ; although iga is present in the lower tract , igg and igm predominate in bronchoalveolar lavage ( bal ) fluids ( kaltreider , ) ."
"the development of immunity in the lung , as elsewhere , requires that relevant cells display appropriate surface molecules for contact and secrete appropriate factors .","some ligand - receptor interactions are specific while others are not , and it is the particular pattern of surface molecules and secreted factors eressed by interacting immune cells that determines the type of immune response that develops during central processing ."
"the cells that are the major initiators and regulators of immunity in the lung include macrophages , dendritic cells ( dcs ) , and lymphocytes , each eressing surface molecules and secretory products that depend on perturbations in the environments .","however , other cells in the milieu , e . g . , epithelial cells , fibroblasts , mast cells , and various recruited blood leukocytes , also play important regulatory roles which will only be briefly examined in subsequent sections ."
"indeed , the bulk of evidence indicates lung macrophages are unlikely apcs in the initiation ofprimary immune responses .","these cells reside within the airways at all levels of the respiratory tract , in the lamina propria , the interstitium , the alveolar regions and pleura , and within pleural spaces ; in ruminant species , lung macrophages are found within the pulmonary capillaries ( lehnert , ; brain , ) ."
"pulmonary macrophages are both phenotypically and functionally diverse , even within a single compartment .","because of ready access to bronchoalveolar macrophages using bal , the diversity of these cells has been most frequently studied ."
"most studies eloit the differences in density ( murphy and herscowitz , ; shellito and kaltreider , ; oghiso , ) , predominantly a function of cell size .","another fractionation technique depends on differences in the cells ' capacity to be readily lavaged , a function of their adherence to epithelium and / or their residence in the bronchial lumen versus in alveoli ."
"important membrane molecules that determine the function of macrophages include complement , fc , mannose , and scavenger receptors , as well as class i and i1 mhc , adhesion , and other signaling molecules .",important differences in many of these exist depending on the location of lung macrophages .
"variable contamination of cells with lung dcs ( pollard and lipscomb , ) and the presence of recently activated t cells in responder populations may well elain reports that am can function as effective apc ( rich et al . , ) .","most current evidence indicates that dcs are the most efficient apc in stimulating naive t cells , especially cd4 t cells , although class i1 mhc - positive cells of many cell types are capable of stimulating recently primed t cells ( steinman , ; croft , ) ."
"resident murine macrophages , particularly at high numbers relative to numbers of stimulator lung dc , suppress a mixed lymphocyte reaction ( mlr ) by secreting tgfp ( lipscomb et al . , b ) .","furthermore , nitric oxide ( no ) made by murine am may inhibit the development of potent apc cell function of lung dc ."
"however , suppressive activity of murine macrophages can be inhibited by eure to gm - csf and to a lesser extent by other selected cytokines ( bilyk and holt , ) .",the major role of ams seems to be to phagocytose and remove potentially dangerous particulates and soluble antigens from the alveoli and to inhibit local lung immune responses .
"since then , the role of dcs in immune responses initiated at the epithelial surface is being clarified .","little doubt exists that dcs play a pivotal role in initiating immune responses in the skin ( reviewed by steinman , ) ."
b7 is a receptor family of at least two molecules in the immunoglobulin supergene family .,"b7 - 1 , ( c 0 ) , and b7 - 2 ( c 6 ) are both eressed constituitively on dcs in contrast to macrophages and b cells that must be activated to eress these molecules ( vandenberghe et al . , ) ."
"dcs form an interdigitating network in the airway epithelium of all species in whom they have been investigated ( sertl et al . , ; holt , ) similar to the network described for skin langerhans cells .","intraepithelial dcs are particularly dense in the trachea and gradually diminish in concentration as the airways branch , but are increased at sites of chronic inflammation ."
"using these techniques , the function of dc - enriched lung cells has been assessed .","effective procedures for isolating fairly pure dc populations require eloiting the phagocytic and autofluorescent properties of lung macrophages ( nicod et al . , , 1 9 8 9 a pollard and lipscomb , ; havenith et al . , a ) ."
"an example of this latter variation relates to cdla ( okt6 ) , eressed by human langerhans cells in the skin , which has been variously described as being present on from less than % ( sertl et al . , ; nicod et al . , ) to % ( van haarst et al . , ) of lung dcs in man .","this antigen may be important in stimulating y6 t cells , a potentially important interaction for host defenses in the lung in view of observations that y6 t cells may recognize heat - shock proteins of mycobacterium tuberculosis ( mtb ) ( born et al . , , kaufmann and kabelitz , ) ."
"the latter two markers are also uniformly eressed on murine thymus and skin dcs , but are absent from the majority of splenic dcs , indicating the likelihood of a closer relationship of lung dcs to tissue dcs rather than to dcs that primarily home from bone marrow to lymphoid tissue .","additional evidence that lung dcs are distinct from the majority of splenic dcs is that lung dcs fail to eress the splenic dc marker recognized by the monoclonal antibody d1 ( pollard and lipscomb , ) ."
"in both rat and mouse , another heterogeneous marker is fcrii , positive on about half of lung dcs ( pollard and lipscomb , ; xia et al . , ) .","interestingly , langerhans cells freshly isolated from the skin eress fcrii which is downregulated as the cells mature in culture ."
"however , in the rat , the fcr - population was a more potent stimulator of naive t cells in an mlr and in responses to lectins , but fcrand fcr + were equally capable of presenting soluble and particulate antigens to antigen - sensitized t cells ( kradin et al . , ) .","no difference was found in mice in the capacity of the fcr + or fcr - subsets to stimulate an mlr ( pollard and lipscomb , ) ."
"ia + dcs were first observed in the nasal turbinates and intensity of ia staining increased in time , first in the trachea and later in lung parenchyma , compatible with environmental eure effecting the change .","using another marker for dc , ox 6 2 ( which also detects y6 t cells ) , these same authors found cd3 - negative , x62 - positive dcs at all levels of the lung in fetal rat lung and speculated that environmental influences upregulated ia eression and subsequent function of these cells ."
"in this latter study , ams pulsed with antigen were also capable of initiating an immune response , but in contrast to dcs heat - killed ams were also able to immunize suggesting that ams stimulated responses by having the antigen reprocessed by the host ' s own apcs .","additionally , elanted lung dcs had gained the ability to stimulate primed t cells following the intratracheal delivery of the relevant antigens ."
"as with lung macrophages and dcs , lung lymphocytes are a dynamic population with the capacity to enter and leave the lung depending on influences in the milieu .","compartments ( holt and schon - hegrad , ; stein - streilein , ; been described either by evaluating markers in situ or by obtaining cells from bal or collagenase digestion of lung tissue ."
"however , balt is not constitutive in all species and not regularly seen in hamsters , mice , and humans .","in these latter species , the majority of lung lymphocytes are present in the interstitiurn , diffusely scattered in the mucosa , alveolar septa , or pleura ."
relatively high numbers of cytolytically active nk cells also exist in the interstitium of mice .,"thus , nk cells in human alveoli fail to eress cytolytic activity and are largely negative for cd16 , although cd16 - eressng nk cells with cytolytic activity exist in the interstitium ."
"flow cytometric analysis of t cell and b cell populations of lung lymphocytes indicates that the relative proportion of b cells is either increased or the same , and the cd4 / c ratios are either decreased or similar compared to peripheral blood abraham et al . , ; marathias et az . , ; huffnagle et al . , ) .","the variance likely depends on the strain of animal , whether they are kept specifically pathogen - free , and the rigor by which small monocytes are excluded ( much of the data are derived from examining wright - giemsa - stained cytospin preparations ) ( lipscomb et al . , ; stein - streilein et al . , ; holt and schon - hegrad , ; nicod et al . , a , b ) ."
"in an examination of epithelium of the upper respiratory tract ( in the nose and covering the tonsil and adenoids ) , both b cells and t cells were found .","in humans , no b cells were found in airway epithelium , and c outnumbered cd4 t cells ( fournier et al . , ) ."
"in studies examining cells isolated from human lung parenchyma , y6 t cells made up less than % of t cells and were cd3 + , cd4 - , and c - ( abraham et al . , ; marathias et al . , ) .","in a study of mice , on the other hand , - 20% of resident lung lymphocytes were cd3 + and ap tcr - , and were presumably y6 t cells ."
research on emigration of cells into the lung has centered on the accumulation of neutrophils within pulmomary vasculature and their immigration into the air spaces of the lung because these cells are likely to play a critical role in the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome .,"nevertheless , with increased information about the role of adhesion molecules in regulating the traffic of lymphocytes ( springer , ) , investigators are beginning to unravel what regulates steady - state movement of cells into the lung as well as possible preemptive signals that occur with inflammation ."
other important markers for naive versus memory t cells are the hyaluronic acid receptor ( cd44 ) and l - selectin .,"naive t cells eress low levels of cd44 and high levels of l - selectin , memory t cells eress high levels of cd44 and low levels of l - selectin ( reviewed in sprent , ) ."
this apc - t cell interaction results in clonal eansion and subsequently provides challenged tissues with a population of cells able to specifically react and protect the host .,"thus , naive t cells have receptors that allow them to migrate to secondary lymphoid organs ( butcher et al . , ; jutila ) ."
"furthermore , lymphocytes infiltrates the overlying bronchial epithelium which demonstrated alterations in morphology compared to adjacent epithelial cells .","they were originally described in the bronchial mucosa of all species examined , e . g . , rabbits , guinea pigs , rats , mice , dogs , pigs , chickens , and man ( bienenstock et al . , a ) ."
"in balus , igm - and igg - bearing cells are present in significant numbers together with iga - positive cells which contrasts with peyers patches in which iga cells predominate ( sminia et al . , ) .","the dome over these areas and underneath the epithelium is a mixture of b and t cells ( sminia et al . , ) ."
"this finding corresponds to the increase in b cells in peyers patches relative to the numbers of b cells in balus ( crawford and miller , ) .","taken together , these studies indicate that the specificity of hev in balus is different from that in peyers patches and more closely resembles the specificity of the hev in mesenteric lymph nodes ( van der brugge - gamelkoorn and kraal , ) ."
"in some members of these species , balt may be completely absent ( pabst , ) .","balt is prominent in certain species including chicken , rabbit , and rat , but is clearly much less prominent in other species , including man ."
"models to examine immune responses to various respiratory antigens were developed in many animal strains , including mice , rats , hamsters , guinea pigs , ferrets , dogs , monkeys , horses , and cattle ; antigens were delivered via aerosol , intranasal , intratracheal , or intrabronchial instillation .","the end point for immunity in eerimental animals was generally measured by assessing the development of hypersensitivity disease clinically and morphologically , measuring serum and / or bronchoalveolar antibody , or characterizing some aspect of cellmediated immunity ( cmi ) such as migration inhibition , delayed - type hypersensitivity ( dth ) via skin test , or lymphoproliferation ( richerson , ; newhouse et al . , ; kaltreider , ; kazmierowski et al . , ; ganguly and waldman , ) ."
"interpretation of early studies did not benefit from the current perspective that the type of immune response that develops , i . e . , cmi versus antibody ( including the predominant isotype of the antibody ) , is regulated by cytokines secreted by t cells and other cells present at sites of antigen deposition ( mosmann and coffman , ) .",more recent studies have eanded the important concepts derived from earlier studies by focusing on the regulatory mechanisms in the development of lung immunity .
models that specifically examine the lung ' s response to infectious agents and alloantigens or lead to hypersensitivity disease are covered later .,"then , while t and b cell immunity are clearly interdependent , studies that have focused on measuring specific t cell responses versus immunoglobulin synthesis in response to noninfectious lung antigens are summarized ."
"most antigen deposited in the lung is cleared by phagocytosis by ams and neutrophils that transport foreign material up the mucociliary escalator and out of the lung , although some antigen is transported to lalns where an immune response is produced .","at least some of this latter antigen is carried free in lymphatic fluid and apparently occurs in circumstances of limited inflammation ( lauweryns and baert , - 1977 ) ."
it is possible that inflammation may also alter the relative proportion of antigen reaching lalns in cells as opposed to antigen free in lymphatic fluid .,"the observation that elevated immune responses are produced in lalns if antigen is deposited in the lungs of animals that have inhaled inflammagens further supports the importance of pulmonary inflammation in the translocation of antigen from the lung to the lalns ( bice et al . , , 198713 ) ."
whether antigen or lung dc initiates a different type of t helper subset response than antigen arriving in phagocytes or free in lymph has not been determined .,"nevertheless , if lung inflammation enhances the transport of antigens from the lung to the lalns , it is possible that inhalation of materials that induce pulmonary inflammation might lead to increased recognition of airborne antigens ."
what redirects the immune t cells back into the lungs ?,does iv or subcutaneous inoculation of similar antigens generate similar degrees of cmi in the lung ?
"inoculation of antigens into the lung can result in both local and systemic cmi ( kaltreider , ) .","as discussed previously , both soluble and particulate antigens can induce immunity , but soluble antigens induce a less easily detectable cmi response than a similar antigen delivered in particulate form as shown by eeriments in which either soluble or aggregated human serum albumin were used as the immunogen ( burrell and hill , ; hill and burrell , ) ."
"however , subcutaneous or iv injection of these antigens failed to result in measurable specific t cell accumulation in the lungs , although systemic cmi could be measured in lymphocytes from nodes draining the subcutaneous inoculation site or from spleen ( waldman and henney , ; nash and holle , ; lipscomb et al . , ) .","in three separate studies , guinea pigs injected via the lung with human y - globulin ( hgg ) , dnp - hgg , or heatkilled influenza virus accumulated specific t cells among lymphocytes recovered from the lungs as measured by migration inhibition factor release or by antigen - induced lymphoproliferation assays ."
"using a live , attenuated rubella vaccine or another live strain of rubella virus , the kinetics of a local cmi response was studied following the inoculation of guinea pigs either subcutaneously or by an intranasal inoculation ( morag et al . , ) .","in these studies , migration inhibition factor activity was the parameter for measuring cmi responses and was initially detected in the lungs weeks after immunization , peaked at weeks , but was no longer detectable by weeks ."
"as previously discussed , although markedly inflamed lungs nonspecifically recruit both t cells and b cells , memory t cells generated in lalns may also have homing molecules that specifically direct their return to the lung ) .","these cells enter the circulation and , under the control of adhesion molecules and locally generated chemotactic and other adhesion molecule - stimulating cytokines , are recruited into inflamed lungs ( berman et al . , ) ."
matrix and lung parenchymal cell adhesion molecules eressed under the control of local environmental perturbations facilitate the emigration of immune cells ; and antigen eressed on the appropriate mhc in the lung leads to preferential retention and further eansion in the lung .,"specificity of recruitment for b cells has not been shown ( see below ) , but in the presence of retained antigen and specific t helper cell recruitment , specific b cells could divide and differentiate ."
"antigen - specific antibody produced in lalns after a primary lung immunization is released into blood ( bice et az . , a ; shopp and bice , ) .","in addition , large numbers of antigen - specific igg , iga , and igm afcs produced in lalns also enter the blood after lung immunization of sevral species , e . g . , dogs , cynomolgus monkeys , chim - panzees , humans ( bice et al . , aj982b ; kaltreider et al . , ; mason et al . , ; weissman et al . , ) ."
"second , afcs enter sites of inflammation produced by instillation of antigen into the lung ( bice et al . , a ; hillam et al . , ) .","however , the recruitment of afcs into inflammatory sites in the lung is not antigen specific because they also enter lung lobes inflamed by instillation of particles or other inflammatory agents ."
"most antigen - specific igm , igg , and iga antibody in the lung after a primary eure to antigen is produced locally by these cells ( hill et al . , ) .","plasma cells are found in the alveoli and interstitial lung tissues of immunized lung lobes suggestig that afcs that enter the lung mature to plasma cells ( bice et al . , a ) ."
"however , the use of adjuvants and large doses of antigen appears to increase the number of afcs in the lung of guinea pigs and mice ( shopp and bice , ; curtis and kaltreider , ) .","it is possible that the strain of species being evaluated may also be important , although no data are available that compare pulmonary b cell responses in different strains of laboratory animals ."
"although primary immune responses are not produced in the lung independently of secondary lymphoid tissues , data suggest that memory responses may be detected in the lung to antigen challenges that are independent of lalns ( mason et al . , ; ada , , ; bice et al . , ) .",the most logical elanation for the production of afcs and antibody in the lung after an antigen challenge is that immune memory cells are recruited into and / or develop in the lung after a primary immunization .
lavage fluid from immunized and challenged lung lobes contained significantly more specified igg several years after the last eure to antigen than was present in lavage fluid from control lung lobes .,"thus , once an intense , localized antibody response was established in the lung , immune mechanisms supported continued localized antibody production for several years after the last eure to antigen , but only at the site of antigen eure ."
"however , the evaluation of antibody production in lung and various extrapulmonary tissues showed that most long - term antibody production occurred in interstitial tissue in the immunized lung lobe .","although afcs were identified in lavage fluid from eed lung lobes several years after antigen challenge , it was possible that cells in interstitial lung tissue , as well as in lalns or distant lymphoid tissues , were all important in long - term antibody production ."
"in addition , the absence of antibody production in lalns or in other distant lymphoid tissue suggests that antibody produced in lung tissue eed to antigen could possibly enter the bloodstream and provide immune protection for uneed lung lobes and extrapulmonary tissues .","therefore , immune cells retained in lung tissue previously eed to antigens may be an important source of antibody to protect the lung ."
"alternatively , b lymphocytes recruited into or produced in the lung in response to the initial antigen challenge might live for several years and continuously secrete antibody .","first , antigen retained in the lung , possibly on follicular dendritic cells , could stimulate antibody production by antigen - specific memory b lymphocytes that migrate through the lung ."
"a major impetus for current research in infectious diseases is to learn more about natural host defenses in infections and how the immune system amplifies these defenses ( mason and nelson , ) .","by better understanding these strategies , the hope is to optimize vaccination of immunocompetent hosts and perhaps even hosts who are immunosuppressed , yet retain some capacity to respond immunologically ."
the use of animal models has considerably enhanced our understanding of lung infections and the role of immunity in controlling them .,"in most pneumonias caused by extracellular bacteria , recruited phagocytes and opsonins , especially antibody and complement , are required to effectively control infections , even when antibiotics are used ."
"in this section , examples of animal models of infectious disease that address how pulmonary immunity develops to various etiologic agents are discussed , and the type ( s ) of immunity that afford protection are indicated .","while investigators have used eerimental models to study nearly all of the infectious agents that produce respiratory infections , space dictates that only a few representative studies be included here ."
several groups demonstrated that animals systemically decomplemented with cobra venom factor had an impaired ability to recruit neutrophils and to clear the organisms from the bronchoalveolar space .,"studies have examined the mechanisms responsible for neutrophil recruitment during the early stages of s . pneumoniae pulmonary infection bruyn et al . , ) ."
"pneumoniae - specific iga could "" arm "" lung lymphocytes which subsequently demonstrated antibacterial action against s .","the role of secretory iga in the prevention of pneumococcal disease is unclear , although one mouse model demonstrated that s ."
the clearance of the organisms appeared to occur in two phases .,"during the initial hr postinoculation , the organisms increased in numbers three - to fivefold , while during the next hr the organisms were rapidly cleared ( toews et al . , ) ."
that systemic igc could provide protection in the lower respiratory tract of animals was also demonstrated by eeriments showing enhanced clearance of h . influenza from the lungs of mice that had received immune sera .,"taken together , these results indicated that in the presence of elevated titers of serum igg , protective antibodies could enter the airways of infected lungs to provide protection against pulmonary pathogens ."
"in contrast to the organisms discussed previously , previous immunization with s . aureus does not appear to enhance clearance or provide protective antibody in pulmonary infections ( jakab , ) .",recent studies suggest that the pulmonary clearance of this organism may be dependent on locally produced opsonins that enhance phagocytosis by am .
"animal models of chronic lung infections with several other important pathogenic organisms have been studied , including pneumocystis carinii ( walzer , ; shel - lit0 et al . , ; harmsen and stankiewicz , ; boylan and current , ) , histoplasma capsdatum ( baughman et al . , ; defaveri and graybill , ; fojtasek et al . , ; allendoerfer et al . , ) , blastomyces dermitiditis ( morozumi et al . , ; moser et al . , ; frey et al . , ; williams et al . , ) , paracoccidiodes braziliensis ( brummer et al . , ; defaveri et al . , ) , coccidiodes immitis ( cox et al . , ) , chlamydia trachomatis and psittaci , rhodococcus equi ( kanaly et al . , ) , and mycobacterium auiumintracellulare ( takashima and collins , ) .","although infection with legionella pneumophila can cause an acute pneumonia in susceptible hosts , it is a facultative intracellular bacterium ; cmi is thought to be necessary for resolution of the infection ."
"after finding an important role for cmi in controlling an aerogenous listeria infection in mice , mackanew extended his studies to propose that cell - mediated hypersensitivity might be an important cause of lung disease ( mackaness , ) .","however , he and his collaborators observed that , in contrast to protection afforded by active immunization , adoptive transfer of listeria immune splenocytes seemed to afford only minor protection against an aerosolized infection ( truitt and mackaness , ) ."
these initial studies were extended by comparing aerosol versus intranasal delivery of mtb and it was found that both routes produced similar pathology .,"mice eed to a mist of virulent mtb developed discreet lesions that were progressively fatal over a - 21 week period ( schwabacher and wilson , ) ."
"several studies have shown that both human and / or mouse am are stimulated to produce chemotactic factors and cytokines in response to mtb or components of the mtb cell wall ( barnes et al . , ; chatterjee et al . , ) .",these released products may represent an early native defense system against mtb .
the decrease in growth coincided with the onset of tuberculin skin test sensitivity and the development of detectable bacillemia .,"in a guinea pig model , it was demonstrated that in animals given a low dose of mtb , the organisms replicated in a log phase until days or , after which enential growth ceased ."
"in comparison to the pulmonary inoculation studies , models using intraperitoneal or iv routes of inoculation have produced different results .","in an intraperitoneal model , an mtb - reactive cd4 t cell clone provided both a dth response and protection as measured by the growth of mtb in the peritoneum ( pedrazzini and louis , ) ."
"other studies suggested that many y6 t cells responded to the heat - shock protein of mtb ( born et al . , ; kaufmann and kabelitz , ) .","other studies suggested they may play a role in granuloma formation ( modlin et al . , ) ."
"other studies in mice examined the granulomatous response to ivinjected bcg in animals that had received neutralizing antibody to tnfa ( kindler et al . , ) .","these and other studies ( amiri et al . , ) indicate that tnfa also plays a critical role in protection against m tb , particularly in the development and maintenance of granulomas ."
the route of immunization with viable organisms can be either iv or by aerosol .,"in general , studies suggest that to enhance the immune response against virulent mtb , viable organisms must be used ( larson and wicht , ) ."
"in summary , the development of protective immunity to a pulmonary infection with mtb requires the coordinated activity of multiple cell types , particularly macrophages and t cells .",the continued study ofthe mtb pulmonary infection should aid in understanding the mechanisms for developing effective cmi in the lung and suggest strategies to enhance pulmonary defenses .
"of importance was that in these studies , passive transfer of serum failed to protect mice .","furthermore , these investigators demonstrated that transfer of t cell - enriched splenocytes from mice immunized by an intranasal infection was capable of protecting mice against an iv challenge ( lim et al . , b ) ."
"we and others developed an intratracheal inoculation infection model with cne to study pulmonary immune mechanisms in mice ( hill and harmsen , ; huffnagle et al . , a ; huffnagle and lipscomb , ) .","in our model , the organism is inoculated in small amounts directly into the trachea and yeasts in the lungs are quantitated by homogenizing the organ and measuring colony - forming units ( cfu ) ."
"over an initial days , the organisms grow rapidly followed by a gradual decrease in cfu in appropriate mouse strains , a process referred to as "" lung clearance "" ( huffnagle and lipscomb , ) .","an important aspect of this model , as is true of many other lung infection models , is that both the strain ofmicroorganism and the strain of mouse determine whether the infection will be cleared from the lung and at what rate ( huffnagle et al . , a ) ."
it was also demonstrated that c cells played a critical role in the development of dth to cne in cneinfected mice and could adoptively transfer dth .,this is an important observation because it proves c t cells can recognize antigens of extracellular organisms in the context of class i mhc .
"the heightened resistance in c . b - 17 mice correlated with eression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) gene in the lungs , was accompanied by secretion of no by lung cells during the early clearance phase , and was completely abrogated by both anti - ifny treatment and feeding animals an inhibitor of no production ( lovchik et al . , ) .","thus , in c . b - 17 mice , clearance in the lung was related to the capacity of the animals to make ifny and no ."
"the answer to this question is still uncertain , but rat am activated by ifny were able to inhibit the growth of cne ( mody et al . , ) .","furthermore , prolonged incubation with gm - csf also activated am for cne growth inhibition ."
"the organism fixes complement by the alternate pathway resulting in c3bi binding to the yeast capsule and allowing phagocytosis by cr3 - positive neutrophils and macrophages ( kozel and pfrommer ; kozel et al . , ) .","human neutrophils and macrophages not only inhibited growth , but killed , cne in cultures that include fresh complement ( miller and mitchell , ) ."
"recently a t cellindependent , partially protective host defense mechanism was found in lung clearance in scid mice and balb / c mice depleted of cd4 andc tcells .","we demonstrated that murine nk cells had a minor effect against the organism following iv inoculation , but failed to play a role in early lung clearance if the organism was inoculated via the trachea ."
this appearance was similar to that seen in the lungs of humans with cryptococcomas who are known to be able to resolve their infections without antibiotic therapy .,"histologic examination of murine lungs during the clearance phase demonstrated that yeasts were surrounded by macrophages with an activated appearance ( hill , ; huffnagle and lipscomb , ) ."
"a closer examination of what effector mechanisms are at work in the lungs of animals that clear a cne infection , particularly in resistant mouse strains that may not utilize no from activated macrophages , may help elucidate host defense mechanisms in man .",continued studies using a murine cne lung infection model should help elucidate the mechanisms that lead to the development of a thl - like response in lalns early during infection and subsequent recruitment of lymphocytes and macrophages into the lung .
"a large number of viruses infect the respiratory tract , including rhinoviruses , coronaviruses , adenoviruses , influenza , and parainfluenza viruses , respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) , measles , mumps , and rubella viruses .",good models in mice exist for both rsv and influenza a infections and are discussed to highlight eerimental models that have provided insight into immune defenses against viral respiratory tract infections .
"the mechanism is unknown , but various theories include immune complex disease , a cd4 t cellmediated dth reaction , or a ctl - mediated pneumonitis ( graham et al . , ) .","subsequent infection after such immunization sometimes resulted in unusually severe infections and even death ( kapikian et al . , ; kim et al . , ) ."
"at least two groups attempted to determine whether various viral subunits might initiate protective immunity , yet cause minimal pathology .","mice vaccinated either parenterally or by intranasal inoculation , followed by nasal rsv challenge , lead to the eression of cytokine mrna in the lungs ( graham et al . , ) ."
eeriments were designed to determine which t cell types caused pathology and whether specific rsv subunits evoked specific pathology - producing immune t cells .,"cell lines were developed from immune lymphocytes of mice immunized against the f protein , the major surface glycoprotein ( g ) , and a - kda matrix protein eressed by recombinant vaccinia virus ( alwan et al . , ) ."
"while immunization against influenza has been successful , it is possible that new immunization protocols might be developed that would be broadly protective .","influenza viruses exhibit antigenic drift and shift that requires individuals be immunized yearly for protection against the prevalent virus strain ( zinkernagel , ; salk and salk , ) ."
"these t cell clones were preferentially retained in lungs of influenza - infected mice , independent of any viral antigenic specificity , and migrated from the pulmonary vessels into the bronchiolar lumens .","further studies indicated that both class i and i1 mhc - restricted t cell clones could promote recovery from a lethal pulmonary infection ( mcdermott et al . , ) ."
"the majority of cells in lavages produced il - 2 , il - 4 , and ifny with relatively little tnf and il - 10 .","depletion of cd4 and c cells caused a significant reduction in il - 2 - and il - 4 - producing cells , but ifny - producing cells remained and were likely cd4 - , c ap , or y6 t cells ; both populations were present during the infection ."
a suggested role for these cells was that they recognized heat shock proteins on inflammatory macrophages and decreased their numbers .,"however , close examination of the data failed to show an inverse relationship of the numbers ofy6 t cells and lung macrophages ."
"among the panel ' s recommended priorities was the development of vaccines for respiratory infections of children , and to improve the current vaccines for pertussis and measles .","an additional priority was to develop vaccines for reemerging infectious diseases , including influenza because of its inherent problems of antigenic drift and shift ."
"thus , an enormous scientific effort is being directed at designing vaccines to protect the host from respiratory pathogens .","and yet the report also highlighted the gaps in our knowledge about normal host defenses at mucosal surfaces , what immune defenses we should attempt to enhance with vaccinations , and the best methods for immunization ."
); the immune response must be quickly available in the respiratory tract and at the site within the respiratory tract where the microorganism is likely to seek entrance and / or produce disease ; and immune memory should be long term .,specific goals for vaccines for respiratory infections are the immune response generated must be protective ( a corollary is that the immune response to a microbial challenge should not cause lung pathology .
the study of the type of protective immune responses that develop during natural infections in man or induced infections in eerimental animals has provided important clues to what responses should be enhanced by immunization .,this has been a productive approach for viral infections and those caused by intracellular pathogens .
"the isotype of the predominating antibody in preventing infection may also be extremely important , e . g . , upper tract infections may be more dependent on iga responses , while in the alveolar spaces , igg may be more effective .","another example of this principle is that although cmi controls cne infections in mice , in special circumstances , antibodies to cne can be protective ( mukheqjee et al . , ) ."
"the vaccine could even consist of a fusion protein of the antigen and the cytokine ( tao and levy , ) .","an innovative strategy for generating cmi responses against nonviable antigens is to inoculate a regulatory cytokine at the time of antigen delivery ( afonso et al . , ) ."
"if infection is initiated in the lower respiratory tract , it may be sufficient that protective cells and antibody are available in circulation if recruitment can occur immediately following challenge .","however , if significant inflammation is required before recruitment of immune cells occurs , some clinical manifestations of infection must necessarily develop , before the protective response neutralizes the infection ."
"based on the data derived from immunization with subunit vaccines or killed microorganisms , it seems unlikely that sufficient t cell memory could be induced for long - term cmi protection against respiratory tract infections .","however , in the presence of continuous antigen , such as would occur with low levels of replicating attenuated viruses or retained intracellular microorganisms in ia - positive apc , memory t cells should persist ."
these models have been particularly useful in distinguishing direct lung toxicity from injuries that result from immune mechanisms .,"animal models of human lung disease have been used to test hypotheses under well controlled conditions and to dissect mechanisms of injury , inflammation , and repair ."
"early work concentrated on dissecting isolated aspects of the immune response , i . e . , the role of antibody , antibody plus complement , or t cells , emphasizing in vivo analogs of in vitro events .","to prove that a lung injury is immune mediated requires previous eure to an appropriate agent , evidence of a specific immune response , and evidence that the injury involves recognized immunologic mechanisms ."
"in contrast , animals immunized with aba - n - acetyltyrosine in cfa exhibited dth without demonstrable serum antibody .","later , ova aerosol challenge in sensitized animals produced scattered focal areas of alveolitis with thickening and increased cellularity of alveolar septa and alveolar filling with mononuclear cells ."
"acute eure lead to transient foci of acute pulmonary inflammation ( richerson et al . , ) , whereas chronic eure caused decreasing inflammation ( richerson et al . , ) .","t cells were prominent in both the acute and the chronic lesions ( upadrashta et al . , ) ."
"however , desensitization is clearly not present in the above models of lung disease , because lymphocyte proliferation and antibody responses were not depressed .","the decrease in pulmonary inflammation during continued challenge has been attributed to desensitization , defined as suppression of preexisting dth by administration of homologous antigen ."
marked differences were shown in responses to instilled igg versus iga immune complexes .,"lung injury was measured using morphology , leakage of labeled intravascular protein and red blood cells into the lung , and quantitation of the neutrophil enzyme , myeloperoxidase , in the lung ( johnson and ward , ) ."
"there was upregulation by elam - 1 on pulmonary venules and capillary endothelium , perhaps mediated through a rat analog to il - 8 ( mulligan et al . , ( mulligan et al . , , 1 9 9 3 a , and upregulation of icam - 1 eression modulated through tnfa ( mulligan et al . , a ) .","eression of vla - 4 and cd18 ( mulligan et d . , b , c ) , functioning cr1 receptors ( mulligan et al . , a ) , and cdlla ( but not cdllb ) , and icam - 1 eression , were also involved ( mulligan et al . , ~ ) ."
iga immune complex lung injury was apparently mediated through nitric oxide or its derivatives .,"iga - mediated injury was similar to igg immune complex injury in that it was vla - 4 , cd18 , and icam - 1 dependent , but was dissimilar in that it is more dependent on c d l l b than c d l l a eression ( mulligan et az . , d ) ."
"although all have some resemblance to human asthma , there are substantial differences , especially in regard to the physiologic response to airway challenge and in methods to induce immune hyperreactivity .",typical protocols use intraperitoneal administration of antigen with aluminum hydroxide and / or bordetella adjuvants .
these animals also demonstrate increased bronchial reactivity to histamine or acetylcholine administered iv .,"using this method of sensitization , guinea pigs exhibit strain differences in blood eosoniphilia and bronchial hyperreactivity ( winthereik et al . , ) ."
"tracheal muscle from these animals exhibited impairment of the usual increase in cyclic amp in response to isoproterenol ( emala et al . , ) , and coincident with the measurement of collateral airway resistance , high resolution ct scanning detected airway narrowing ( herold et al . , ; corddry et al . , ) .","spontaneous and induced histamine release from bal mast cells was increased compared to control animals ( hirshman et al . , ) ."

"using picryl chloride epicutaneous sensitization , mice challenged with intranasal hapten exhibited peribronchiolar cellular infiltration and increased pulmonary resistance in vivo ( garssen et al . , ) .",hypersensitivity to carbacol was present in tracheas from such animals and could be transferred with t cells from sensitized animals .
"eosinophil infiltration into the tracheas of sensitized mice after aerosol antigen challenge is dependent on cd4 cells and il - 5 ( nakajima et al . , ) and can be blocked by inoculations of ifny ( iwamoto et al . , ) .","antibody to il - 5 can ablate the eosinophilic airway response to ova eure in sensitized guinea pigs and can even block the ovainduced increased sensitivity to substance p ( chand et al . , ; mauser et al . , ) ."
"induction of tolerance by injection of hapten - coupled splenocytes before sensitization depressed both the skin and the pulmonary responses following tracheal challenge ( kimura et al . , ) .","the inflammatory and fibrotic responses to intratracheal hapten challenge were transferred with immune lymphocytes , but not with immune serum ."

"mcp - 1 is produced by fibroblasts ( rolfe et al . , ) and tgfp is produced by pulmonary artery endothelial cells ( phan et al . , or lung fibroblasts ( breen et al . , ) .","although many of the cytokine studies concentrated on the role of am , recent reports indicate that pulmonary endothelial cells constitutively produced il - 6 which is increased by eure to bleomycin ( karmiol et al . , ) ."
"different strains of mice responded differently to intratracheal bleomycin ( schrier et al . , a ) .","pulmonary fibrosis did not occur in athymic nude mice ( schrier et al . , ) and depletion of both cd4 and c t cells prevented fibrosis ( jordana et al . , ) ."
"cyclosporin a administration blocked pulmonary fibrosis , but not alveolitis , and bal il - la and tnfa , but not il - 6 ( denis et ul . , a ) , which suggested a role for t cells in producing fibrosis .","it was associated with increased bal il - la , il - 6 , and tnfa ( denis et al . , ) ."

"cells for adoptive transfer were obtained from spleen , peripheral lymph nodes , lalns , and peritoneal exudate from immunized animals .",schuyler and colleagues have developed an adoptive transfer murine model of eerimental hp using m . faeni .
"successful transfer was also dependent on the presence of cd4 t cells in the recipient ( schuyler et al . , b ) , suggesting the necessity of an important interaction between host and recipient cd4 t cells .","the transferred cells were a mixture of naive and memory cd4 t cells , as defined by cd44 , cd45rb , and l - selectin eression ( schuyler et al . , a ( schuyler et al . , , 1992 ."
"the histoincompatible allografted lung is recognized as "" foreign "" by the recipient and , therefore , is subject to rejection ( randhawa and yousem , ) .","in gvhd , donor immunocompetent allogenic cells recognize the recipient as foreign ( farrara and deeg , ) ."
"in grade or "" severe acute rejection "" mononuclear cell infiltrates extend into air spaces and involve vessels and bronchioles .","in grade acute lung cancer allograft rejection , also known as moderate acute rejection , infiltrates progress and become more apparent around pulmonary veins , arterioles , and peribron - ( gvhd ) in the lung : a pathologic comparison chiolar areas ( yousem et al . , ) ."
the histologic changes of acute gvhd were analogous to grade or severe acute rejection in a lung allograft .,"in these studies the histologic lesions included alveolitis , lymphocytic bronchitis , and vasculitis ."
"the histology of bo shows granulation tissue plugs within the lumens of the small airways , epithelial cell damage , mononuclear cell infiltrates , and , at times , complete obstruction of the airways ( epler , ; randhawa and yousem , ) .","bronchiolitis obliterans observed in chronic lung allograft rejection and gvhd involve the membranous and respiratory bronchioles , and possibly involve more proximal airways ( randhawa and yousem , ) ."
"both canine and rat models have been utilized to study lung transplantation and the immunopathogenesis of rejection ( benfield , ; prop et al . , a , b ) .","however , the availability of more immunological reagents has allowed the rat model developed by marck , prop , and wildevuur to be more extensively studied ( marck et al . , ) ."
"in a murine model utilizing hetertopically transplanted airways , the characteristic lesions of bo developed in the allograft after days ( hertz et al . , ) .","the airway lesions were associated with upregulated class i1 mhc eression on the epithelium in the large airways , aggregates of dcs in the submucosa , and ulcerated epithelium ( uyama et al . , ) ."
"human lung allograft recipients usually require life - long therapy to prevent rejection ( trulock , ) .","a significant difference between the rat models and that of clinical transplantation is that only one or two doses of the immunosuppressant drug , cyclosporin , results in indefinite acceptance of the donor rat lung ( uyama et al . , ) ."
"the presence f many immunocompetent cells present in the donor lung that can stimulate a rejection response may be the elanation ( prop et al . , a , b ; trulock , ) .","notably , despite the large numbers of t lymphocytes present in the lung and thus carried into the recipient , the clinical syndrome of systemic gvhd has not been reported in human lung allografted individuals ."
"acute lung allograft rejection is believed to be initiated by donor lung apc , i . e . , dcs and perhaps macrophages , interacting with recipient lymphocytes ( winter et al . , ) .","although there is no direct evidence that these accessory cells mediate allograft rejection , several studies suggest their role in the rejection responses ."
"in contrast , th2 lymphocyte activity , i . e . , production of il - 4 and il - 10 , which downregulates t h l activity , has been strongly associated with prevention of allograft rejection ( gorczynski and wojcik , ) .","the clinical importance of t h l lymphocytes in allograft rejection is exemplified by the fact that the primary immunosuppressive agent used in recipients of human lung allografts is cyclosporin , which preferentially inhibits il - 2 and ifny production from lymphocytes ( cockfield et al . , ) ."
"furthermore , ifny production , induced by human lung macrophages , selectively stimulated igg2 production from allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( wilkes and weissler , ) .","in recipients of lung allografts undergoing rejection , wilkes demonstrated that local production of igg2 was selectively upregulated and , thus , served as a marker for the rejection response ( wilkes et al . , b ) ."
"significantly , anti - tnfa antibodies reduced the vasculitis and hemorrhagic lesions in rejecting lung allografts ( saito et al . , ) .",evidence that tnfa was involved in rejection was demonstrated by demeester who reported that tnfa mrna and protein were upregulated in lung tissue during acute rejection of rat lung allografts .
"in contrast , no animal models of chronic gvhd have reported an association with this type of pulmonary disease .","as previously stated , the clinical manifestations of chronic gvhd in the lung are associated with the development of bo ( farrara and deeg , ; randhawa and yousem , ; yousem et al . , ) ."
reported ( 1 9 9 4 a ) that allogeneic bal cells instilled into murine lungs resulted in the predominant local production of igg2a .,"additionally , only igg2a was shown to be deposited in the perivascular and peribronchiolar extracellular connective tissues , the same anatomic locations involved in lung allograft rejection and gvhd of the lung ."
"subsequent testing of historical samples collected during the week of april , identified the index herd in ohio .",the virus spread rapidly across large geographic regions ; cases of infection were identified in states during the first weeks of the outbreak .
"implementation of "" all in - all out "" sites , which are sites in which pigs are grown and all pigs in a group are removed before arrival of the next group , limits the spread of disease introduced by transport vehicles .",pigs are commonly transported to harvest facilities in vehicles that have not been cleaned and disinfected between loads .
"sample collection consisted of rubbing a phosphate - buffered saline - moistened pad ( swiffer , procter & gamble , cincinnati , oh , usa ) over an cm area of the trailer floor , cm from the rear door .","for each trailer , the following information was collected : transport company and trailer identification , time of unloading , dock used , whether the truck driver stepped on the dock , and whether facility personnel entered the trailer ."
"the forward primer sequence was - cgcaaagact - gaacccactaacct - 3 , the reverse primer sequence was - ttgcctctgttgttacttggagat - 3 , and the probe sequence was - tgttgccattaccac - gactcctgc - 3 .","sequences were labeled by using the fam / zen / 3 iowa black detector ( integrated dna technologies , coralville , ia , usa ) ."
"this result suggests that the pigs transported to the harvest facility on the trailers may not have been shedding pedv , but instead , the trailers had been contaminated by previous loads of pigs , so viral quantities in the trailer were low or at the limit of detection .","environmental samples from these trailers tended to have higher cycle threshold values than those from the trailers that were positive before and after unloading : versus , respectively ."
"this was measured by multiplying the prevalence of contamination at arrival by the inverse of the cycle threshold value from trailers contaminated at arrival ( r = 2 , p = 1 ) .",facilities in which more pedv was identified in truck trailers on arrival had a higher overall incidence of contamination .
"this study suggests that collection points , such as harvest facilities and livestock auction markets , can be an efficient source of contamination of transport vehicles that return to pig farms and likely played a role in rapidly disseminating pedv across vast geographic regions shortly after pedv was first identified in the united states .",harvest facilities serve as a source of contact between many swine farms with different health statuses .
"current data suggest that novel agents , such as pedv , may be present in a country but remain undetected for an extended period .","the results of this study suggest that proactive disease control measures should include improved sanitation , hygiene , and segregation practices at collection points to limit the spread of the agent early in the outbreak ."
"persons living with autoimmune diseases and dialysis were estimated to be 7% and 4% , respectively .",we distributed dialysis treatment prevalence by age and autoimmune diseases by rheumatoid arthritis age - specific incidence .
"because of milder symptoms , we accounted for isolation and halved r0 from the third and fourth day for ordinary and modified smallpox , respectively .","for ordinary smallpox , we assumed an r0 of 6 , estimated from a detailed study of an outbreak in nigeria in a unvaccinated community , and for modified smallpox , we assumed an r0 of ( 2 / 3 of the r0 estimated for the ordinary type ) ."
he then illustrated the reaction of gvn with the assembly of a global zika task force that was established within three months after the association between zikv infection and microcephaly was recognized .,"this task force gathered eerts on flaviviruses , arboviruses , and viral congenital diseases from gvn centers from countries ."
"besides communication of the latest information on zikv and the distribution of eert reviews ( weaver et al . , ) the task force , which was supported by a private donation , established the gvn zikv serum bank .",this serum bank collected and characterized more the sera from donors who had been eed in different countries all across south and latin america .
weaver also reported on zikv vaccine strains that were attenuated through deletions in the utr .,"as a dna - launched zikv live - attenuated vaccine , having a - nucleotide deletion , this mutant virus gave rise to high antibody titers after a single immunization and was highly protective in a zikv mouse model , as well as , in a rhesus macaque infection model ( zou et al . , ) ."

"during an arbovirus outbreak in humans , clinical signs might only be detected when the peak of an outbreak has already been passed .","however , virus circulation in vectors and the animal reservoir will precede human infections ( reusken et al . , ) ."
"however , countries need to adapt their surveillance scheme to their epidemiological situation , surveillance objectives and capacities .",surveillance in vectors and in vertebrate hosts enables detection of arbovirus circulation before clinical onset in humans .
htlv - 1 is the causal agent of adult t - cell leukemia ( atl ) and htlv - 1 - associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis ( ham / tsp ) in adults .,"it has close relatives in several nonhuman primates and is an important human pathogen with a global distribution of infection foci and an estimated million people are infected ( sonoda et al . , ) ."
"while the cellular receptor for htlv - 1 is ubiquitous ( manel et al . , ) the provirus is mainly detected in cd4 + effector / memory t cells in vivo .","however , it was not clear if htlv - 1 preferentially infects these cells or if infected precursor cells differentiate into these cells ."
"while tax has an important role in the upregulation of anti - apoptotic genes and the maintenance of cell populations it is only eressed transiently , most likely because the tax protein is highly immunogenic and a major target for ctl .","in leukemic cells tax is eressed only in a minor fraction of the cells and only for a short period of time ( mahgoub et al . , ) ."
the recent ebola outbreak in west africa and the ongoing outbreak in the democratic republic of congo illustrate how demographical and political changes can affect spreading of diseases .,"she presented several examples to underline how changes in environmental conditions and in human behavior can create conditions that result in an increase of pathogen transmission , spill - over to new hosts , broad dissemination of infection , and changes in viral properties ."
"the utility of such approaches will very much depend on a switch from the detection of single pathogens to an "" open view "" surveillance with multiplex assays , broad antibody profiling , metagenomics approaches , and an efficient way of data sharing .","matching these surveillance data with data on demographic development , global travel and trade , and climate change might allow to predict potential international spread of pathogens ."
"an eerimental approach to clear latent hiv and thus cure hiv infection has been dubbed "" shock and kill . """,lras are used to activate latent hiv allowing the reactivated cells to be targeted and killed by art and / or the immune system .
"the four bases of the genetic code create codons , of which are translated into amino acids and are stop codons .",synonymous codons differ principally at the third base or wobble position .
"thus , basic research is needed to understand the viral protein conformations and their role in viral replication .","while the genome of ebola virus encodes just seven proteins , the deleterious effects on the human body are immense causing severe pathology and fatalities ."
structure - directed mutagenesis studies identified conserved critical residues in the np - vp35 interface which could be targeted by broadly effective antivirals .,"with regard to the matrix protein vp40 , another multi - structural protein , it rearranges into three alternative structures , each with its corresponding function at different stages of the life cycle ."
it was found that rsv and hsv - 1 accumulate rich protein corona layers that are unique for each biological fluid and corona pre - coating differentially affects viral infectivity and immune cell activation .,"in addition , like nanoparticles , viruses should be able to function as nano - surface catalysts that enable accelerated extracellular amyloid protein aggregation ."
"results from ezzat et al . , showed that unlike the viral genome coded surface proteins , the viral protein corona is an acquired structural layer that is dependent on the viral microenvironment resulting in different viral identities based on the target tissue and the target organism .","the authors also showed that hsv - 1 , which has been implicated in alzheimer ' s disease , catalyzes the nucleation and accumulation of the a peptide both in vitro and in vivo ."
ken olson from colorado state university reviewed the rnai and arbovirus interactions .,"such infections in aedes aegypti allows transmission of yellow fever , dengue , zika , and chikungunya viruses throughout the mosquito ' s lifetime ."
integrated viral - derived ( vdna ) can also be detected in the mosquito genome as endogenous viral elements ( eves ) that are often associated with pirna clusters in the mosquito genome .,eves are transcribed to produce pirnas that associate preferentially with piwi4 .
"to help answer this question , the virologic differences and the underlying molecular mechanisms between the representative historical african mr766 zikv strain and the epidemic brazilian br15 zikv strain were examined .",glioma snb - 19 cell line and - d neurospheres were used to evaluate both primary and chimeric viruses .
"chimeric virus analyses suggested that the zikv e protein correlates with the viral attachment , and the c - prm region contributes to the permissiveness and zikv - induced cytopathic effects .","furthermore , the prm protein and its cleaved pr product , but not the mature m protein , induces apoptotic cell death in the snb - 19 cells ."
dr . akkina presented both in vitro and in vivo studies conducted on human cells .,in vivo studies involved humanized mice ( hu - mice ) that harbor a transplanted human immune system .

isolated nasal mucosa and tracheal elants were maintained in vitro and infected with mers - cov / qatar .,dr . rodon described the isolation of respiratory tissues to assess the early local immune events elicited upon infection .
"the identification of a novel pestivirus in harbor porpoises suggests that the host spectrum of pestiviruses extends to members of the order cetacea ( whales , dolphins , and porpoises ) , which are considered to have evolved from artiodactyls ( even - toed ungulates ) ( jo et al . , ) .","based on the new sequence information rt - pcr screening of samples from more than stranded harbor porpoises , collected from the north sea indicated that about % of these animals were positive for the novel pestivirus ."
a bottleneck for the production of live attenuated virus vaccines has been the lack of permanent cell lines able to sustain productive virus infection .,"in the studies presented , porcine alveolar macrophages ( pam ) were used to propagate the viruses ."
"moreover , the percentage of seniors that showed t - cell mediated responses was significantly reduced and also lower in intensity compared to young adults ( arnold et al . , ) .",the low seroconversion rate even in the im group showed a progressive decline with increasing age of the cohort and was associated with significantly lower igg2 and igg1 isotypes suggesting a marked shift in th1 responses .
"this irb provided rapid review of multiple protocols during the epidemic , typically with h or less from submission to approval .",the university of nebraska medical center ( unmc ) institutional review board ( irb ) response during the - 2015 ebola epidemic provided an example of research ethics review under a rapid response model .

"he finally emphasized a key point of the one health concept , which is communication among eerts , politicians , stakeholders and society ( reperant et al . , ) .","moreover , all these aspects should be accompanied by investment in therapeutics discovery and preventive intervention strategies ."
"consequently , confronting emerging epidemics at the source and from the onset is paramount to control global infectious disease prevention and mitigation scenarios .","moreover , we are still in a reactive framework ( acting once the disease is present ) and should rather move towards a preventive and preparedness strategy , that ideally prevents interspecies transmission of pathogens to occur , and if not successful provide the tools for early detection and intervention strategies ."
he then described the robotized lab - in - a - box automated platformed in a bsl3 + environment for high - throughput screening now installed at the rega institute .,"dr . neyts pointed out that for many other viruses that cause life - threatening infections and many of which are considered emerging and / or neglected pathogens , there are no drugs available ."
"dr . neyts presented the current state of rega institute ' s development of potent antivirals against flaviviruses ( such as dengue ) , alphaviruses ( such as chikungunya ) and enteroviruses as well as against noroviruses , the hepatitis e and the rabies virus .","several excellent molecular targets for the selective inhibition of viral replication ( and that have remained largely unelored ) have been identified , such as the non - structural protein ns4b of flaviviruses , the capping machinery of alphaviruses and the c helicase of enteroviruses ."
"as for entero / rhinoviruses , besides the target for capsid binders like pocapavir ( thibout et al . , ) , the researchers at the rega institute have found a novel druggable pocket formed by the viral proteins vp1 and vp2 in the virus capsid and have now identified analogs targeting this pocket with broad spectrum activity ( abdelnabi et al . , ) .","also described was a novel class of tryptophan dendrimers targeting the capsid five - fold vertex were found to inhibit ev - a71 replication at low nanomolar to high picomolar concentrations in vitro ( sun et al . , ) ."
"once a hit with antiviral properties has been identified , its optimization to become a lead is a multiparameter process , that can also be determined by the mechanism of action of the compound .","as an example , it is indicated that phenotypic screening is still one of the main strategies do identify novel classes of antiviral agents while for other therapeutic areas target - based or fragment - based screening has often become more relevant ( murcko , j . , ; brown and bostrom , ) ."
the evolution of viruses involves two major steps : ( i ) intra - host ( shortterm ) and ( ii ) inter - host ( long - term ) evolution .,"esteban domingo , centro de bilog a molecular severo ochoa ( csic - uam ) , spain , discussed the development of antiviral resistance ."
how events in step ( i ) influence events in step ( ii ) is an open question .,"selection of mutants resistant to antiviral agents , one of the major problems in antiviral therapy , occurs at step ( i ) and its consequences are felt in steps ( i ) and ( ii ) ."
"resistant mutants can acquire epidemiological relevance , therefore affecting step ( ii ) of virus evolution .","epidemiological dominance of resistant mutants may render ineffective the relevant antiviral agents , a problem with similarities to antibiotic resistance in bacteria ."

"basic research was represented by the work of dr . heinz ellerbrok ( robert koch institut , berlin , germany ) who developed new three - dimensional cell culture infection models based on a biological extracellular matrix ( decellularized equine pericardium ) with primary human keratinocytes ( koban et al . , ) .","using these models for studying antiviral susceptibility in cowpox virus infection , ellerbrok and colleagues showed that the inhibitory potency of host - directed epidermal growth factor receptor - blocking molecules such as gefitinib and cetuximab was considerably higher in three - dimensional cell culture models than in conventional two - dimensional models , suggesting that the classical monolayer cell cultures could underestimate the potential inhibitory effect of an undetermined number of antiviral drugs ."
"these observations together with the fact that nevirapine , doravirine and efavirenz alter the efficiency of the ppt / u3 cleavage and impair the initiation of ( + ) - strand dna synthesis , suggest that this step of reverse transcription could become a specific target for antiretroviral intervention .","using different hiv - 1 and hiv - 2 rt variants , this study showed that major determinants defining the correct cleavage site at the ppt / u3 junction of the hiv genome reside at the connection subdomain between positions - 351 ."

"in fact , it is typical of the many everyday interactions that each of us undertakes with little effort or reflection .",but there is a real sense in which my response does reveal something significant .
i use this lack of knowledge to conclude that the train does not stop in newry .,the premise of this argument lays bare my lack of knowledge or ignorance .
"if the drug did cause harm , the trial and subsequent review would reveal that to be the case .","also , the results of the trial have been reviewed by a panel of eerts in the area ."
"with ignorance as the source of so much human suffering , it will seem strange to the reader that i should now propose that ignorance be positively embraced under certain circumstances .",those circumstances are represented by the ' train ' argument in sect .
"the only reason they have any leverage at all in the above argument is because there is a complete , extensively searched knowledge base that does not contain knowledge of x or y ( where x and y could be propositions in a knowledge base ) .",but let us be under no illusion about either of these conditions .
"this statement leaves me with doubt , therefore , i don ' t know ( 50 - year - old , university educated , white british woman ) the statement "" there is no evidence that the asthma drug is unsafe "" leaves some doubt that it is generally safe to all groups ( 59 - year - old , university educated , white british woman )","the text states "" there is no evidence that scrapie was transmissible to humans "" ."
"this was variously eressed , with some participants reporting a lack of confidence , while others said they were not sure about what to conclude :",the absence of evidence left some participants with a sense of uncertainty that something was or was not the case .

"in our example above , we tend to doubt that all information that relates to the train journey between belfast and dublin ( domain d ) can be contained in knowledge base k , represented here by the timetable , when we discover that the timetable is old or that the copy i am consulting has missing pages .",this simple example of how the closed world assumption can fail to hold in a particular case powerfully illustrates that there are certain conditions on the use of ignorance in argument .
"moreover , time is not the only condition that may affect whether the closed world assumption holds in a particular case .",we are beginning to see some of the complex judgements that arguers must make as they attempt to evaluate the rational merits of different arguments .

"in other words , the available evidence was very extensively examined by brown and his colleagues .","moreover , these investigators were eertly qualified to make an assessment of the evidence ."
one context in which ' no evidence ' statements are used extensively in medicine and health is in the conclusions of systematic reviews .,"when we consider what these reviews involve , it is not difficult to see why this is the case ."
such studies are typically randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) like those referred to by pennington et al .,in the conclusion of a systematic review of the use of speech and language therapy ( slt ) to treat children with dysarthria ( a motor speech disorder ) that is acquired before three years of age : this review found no evidence from randomised trials of the effectiveness of speech and language therapy interventions to improve the speech of children with early acquired dysarthria .
there is no evidence that slt is effective in the treatment of children with early acquired dysarthria .,"therefore , slt is not effective in the treatment of children with early acquired dysarthria ."
a systematic review of other types of studies can also give rise to ' no evidence ' statements .,"however , to the extent that these statements are based on reviews of studies other than rcts , they may provide weaker warrant in an argument from ignorance ."
"but this rational warrant is altogether weaker than the rational warrant in our first example , on account of the fact that it is based on a systematic review of observational studies and not rcts :",this conclusion can certainly provide some rational warrant for the claim that screening does not achieve a lowering of prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhoea in msm .
there is an absence of evidence that screening for chlamydia and gonorrhoea lowers the prevalence of these infections in msm .,screening for chlamydia and gonorrhoea does not lower the prevalence of these infections in msm .
what do you think journals should do with systematic reviews that report no evidence ?,"however , some eerts disagree , arguing that inconclusive systematic reviews simply reinforce the message that there is clinical uncertainty ."
you feel reasonably convinced on the basis of the press statement that water fluoridation does not cause ill health effects in humans .,so you try to make the best assessment possible of the findings of the report based on the press release from phe .
"however , you have sufficient trust in the eertise of this body to conclude that the authors of the report will have conducted the fullest review possible of all the available evidence on the health effects of fluoridation .",the press release from phe states that this is the first report on the health of people living in fluoridated areas since phe came into existence in april .
"rather , the conclusion of the argument from ignorance - fluoridation does not cause harm to humans - is also supported by two other findings that are independent of the argument from ignorance .","first , the argument does not stand alone as the sole means of rational persuasion of readers ."
the underlined temporal markers in these statements indicate that the emergence of new evidence may necessitate a revision of the knowledge base upon which these ' no evidence ' claims are based .,"in some cases , these markers may have the effect of dissuading a reader from drawing an inference based on ignorance altogether ."
"recognizing that this announcement would cause widespread concern among the thousands of british women who had also received pip implants , the chief medical officer , professor dame sally davies , released a press statement to the public and wrote a letter to general practitioners , medical directors in the national health service ( nhs ) , and cancer and plastic surgeons .","the issue on this occasion concerns the safety of poly implant proth se ( pip ) breast implants following an announcement on december that the french government was recommending women to have these implants removed as a precautionary , but non - urgent measure ."
there is no evidence that pip implants have a disproportionate rate of implant rupture .,pip implants do not have a disproportionate rate of implant rupture .
pip implants are not linked with an increase in incidence of cancer .,there is no evidence that pip implants are linked with an increase in incidence of cancer .
this issue could only be addressed by the investigation led by sir bruce keogh as part of the work of his eert group .,no amount of genotoxicity and chemical toxicity testing could address this concern .
"as a result of the urgency to provide public reassurance about the safety of pip implants , the chief medical officer made fallacious use of the argument from ignorance .",her repeated use of ' no evidence ' statements suggested that a closed knowledge base was already available to investigators when this was in fact not the case .
these statements were a hasty reaction to the precautionary measures taken by the french government .,"alongside the overuse of ' no evidence ' statements , another feature of this scenario that should have alerted us to a potentially fallacious use of the argument from ignorance was the timing of the chief medical officer ' s statements ."
features to observe there must be good reasons to suppose that the closed world assumption holds in a particular case .,information that can help an arguer close a knowledge base should be provided .
"when these markers are noticeably absent , it should raise suspicion of a fallacious argument from ignorance .",markers such as at the present time and from the available evidence suggest that any claim based on a ' no evidence ' statement is subject to revision should new evidence emerge .
it has been argued throughout the chapter that there is nothing inherently fallacious about the argument from ignorance .,"rather , the argument is more or less rationally warranted under certain conditions ."
deliberation is also a time - intensive process as agents interrogate all aspects of a problem or issue .,"through its termination of deliberation , the ignorance heuristic is achieving important economies in terms of time and resources for cognitive agents ."
"from this premise , it is concluded that p is false ( alternatively , not - p is false ) .","the standard view of the argument from ignorance is that it is a fallacy , a type of weak , invalid , or bad reasoning ."
"other linguistic markers include eressions like currently , at this stage and to date .",they can help an arguer decide if the closed world assumption and extensive search criterion are fulfilled in a particular case .
walton examines everyday conversations in which the argument is used as a respectable form of reasoning and also situations in which it is fallacious .,there is discussion of prominent cases such as the salem witchcraft trials and mccarthy hearings .
"temporal markers such as so far , currently and at the present stage can be used to indicate that a closed knowledge base may have to be revised if contrary evidence emerges at a later date .",they are accordingly important markers of the defeasibility of claims that are based on an absence of evidence or knowledge .
""" the recent avian flu outbreak among birds and poultry is a cause for concern .","the permanent secretary for health , welfare and food , mrs carrie yau , convened an interdepartmental meeting this afternoon to review hong kong ' s readiness to fight avian influenza amid fears that migratory birds might spread the virus with the approach of winter ."

"part ( b ) : in this extract , so far is not used to indicate the defeasibility of a claim based on an absence of evidence .","that role is performed by the eression to date , which indicates that the following claim may have to be revised at a later point in time : the h5n1 virus is not capable of efficient human - to - human transmission ."
the second instance is used to indicate the defeasibility of the following claim : a . albopictus has not become established .,the first instance is used to indicate the defeasibility of the following claim : a . albopictus does not exist .
this suggests that the outbreak is over and there is unlikely to be any need to revise the knowledge base at a later point in time .,( e ) the extract says that no individuals eerienced illness onset after december .
type iv pili are unique in their ability to be retracted by the organism .,"retraction is responsible for a form of surface motility called twitching motility , allowing the organism to pull itself across a surface as a consequence of sequential rounds of extension , anchoring , and then retraction of pilus fibers ."
"the main steps in type iv pilus biogenesis are as follows : the major pilus subunit ( pila1 in k . kingae ) is translated as a pre - protein , which undergoes cleavage of the signal sequence by a dedicated inner membrane peptidase called pild .","after processing , the mature subunit can be incorporated into the growing type iv pilus fiber by the pilus assembly complex , which contains the cytoplasmic protein pilm , the periplasmic proteins piln , pilo , and pilp , the inner membrane spanning protein pilg , and the oligomeric outer membrane secretin pilq ."
"elimination of either pilc1 or pilc2 results in a decrease in k . kingae adherence to cultured human epithelial cells , and elimination of both pilc1 and pilc2 results in a non - piliated phenotype .","while there is not yet any direct evidence showing that the k . kingae pilc1 and / or pilc2 proteins mediate direct interaction with host cells , recent studies demonstrating that a k . kingae mutant that is able to eress pilus fibers lacking pilc1 and pilc2 is non - adherent suggest that these proteins are the adhesive components of the fiber ( porsch and st . geme , unpublished data ) ."
the n - terminal signal sequence directs the protein through the sec secretion system into the periplasm .,"trimeric autotransporters are members of the type v secretion family and contain an n - terminal signal sequence , an internal passenger domain , and a c - terminal b - barrel outer membrane anchoring domain ."
"the n - terminal signal sequence consists of amino acids - 54 , and the c - terminal membrane domain consists of amino acids - 1783 .","amino acids - 1694 constitute the internal passenger domain , which is constructed in a modular manner and contains multiple yada - like head domains , trp domains , kg domains , neck domains , and a single isneck2 domain , as diagrammed in fig ."
"according to this model , it should be possible to isolate genotypically identical bacteria from the oropharynx and the site of invasive disease ( i . e . , blood , joint fluid , and bone ) in patients with invasive k . kingae disease .",the pathogenic model of invasive k . kingae disease postulates that the source of invading bacteria is the colonizing population in the upper respiratory tract .
"the k . kingae rtx toxin is a member of the repeats - in - toxin family and has been shown to be cytotoxic to a wide range of cell types in vitro , including respiratory epithelial cells , synovial cells , macrophage - like cells , and red blood cells .",the k . kingae rtx toxin was discovered following the observation that introduction of k . kingae onto a cell monolayer resulted in cell rounding and lysis .
"it is a pore forming toxin and forms 4 nm radius pores in the host cell membrane that display voltage - dependent gating , with a channel conductance similar to general diffusion .",comparison of a wild type and an isogenic rtx mutant strain in an infant rat model of invasive k . kingae disease revealed decreased virulence by the rtx mutant .
"once k . kingae breaches the respiratory epithelial layer and enters the bloodstream , the organism must be able to evade host immune mechanisms in order to persist and disseminate to sites of invasive disease .","while there are only a few studies addressing potential k . kingae immune evasion strategies , current evidence suggests that eression of a polysaccharide capsule and antigenic variation of selected surface - displayed proteins play a role in survival of the bacterium during invasive disease ."
"polysaccharide capsules are considered classical virulence factors and have been shown to play many roles in host - pathogen interactions , including masking of antigenic surface epitopes , prevention of complement factor deposition , prevention of phagocytosis , and host mimicry .","n . meningitidis , h . influenzae , and streptococcus pneumoniae ) eress a polysaccharide capsule , a layer of surface - associated polysaccharide chains that surround and ' encapsulate ' the bacterium ."
"examination of a large collection of israeli healthy carrier and invasive disease isolates revealed a total of four k . kingae capsule types , including the galnac - kdocontaining capsule ( designated type a ) , an n - acetylglucosamine - kdo - containing capsule with a [ ! 6 ) - a - glcpnac ( in the israeli collection of isolates , approximately % of invasive disease isolates eressed either the type a or type b capsule .","in contrast , only % of carrier isolates eressed the type a or type b capsule , suggesting that the type a and type b capsule structures may provide a selective advantage for the organism in the bloodstream and contribute to the development of k . kingae invasive disease ( starr , porsch , and st . geme , submitted ) ."
"while not demonstrated eerimentally , it is likely that the polysaccharide capsule is also able to mask other surface antigens , many of which are smaller than knh .","adherence by this mutant can be restored by eliminating capsule eression , uncovering knh , and allowing knh access to host cell receptors ."
analysis of a collection of k . kingae systemic isolates showed that strains recovered from the blood of patients with uncomplicated bacteremia were generally piliated but typically eressed relatively few pili .,"k . kingae can cause uncomplicated bacteremia or can disseminate from the bloodstream to joints , bones , or the endocardium ."
"serum igg and iga levels in children years of age and older progressively increase while the incidence of disease progressively decreases , suggesting that k . kingae carriage or eure in the first years of life may be an immunizing event .","however , k . kingae outer membrane protein epitopes have been shown to be polymorphic among diverse strains , raising the possibility of strain specific immune responses that may not prevent recolonization by an antigenically distinct strain ."
"the group with highest surviving median values was e1 , amounting two times the survival median in comparison with the control groups ( p = 07 ) .","group e2 received this medication as group e1 throughout the trial , but starting day before the challenge with wssv ."
"it has been suggested that world weather changes have contributed to the dissemination of this disease ( sonnenholzner et al . , ) .","this disease seems to have spread world - wide , except perhaps to australia ."
"it has been claimed that this drug preparation stimulates production of gamma interferon in human beings ( sugawara , ) .","glycyrrhizic acid possesses antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo interfering with both dna and rna replications , hence interfering with replication of a wide range of viruses , including herpes , influenza a and b , hepatitis b , coronavirus , and sars ( badam , ; chen , ; durand et al . , ; lee et al . , ; lin , ; pompei et al . , ) ."
thus each replicate was carried out with shrimps and the groups were distributed as follows :,shrimps had a mean weight of g at the beginning of the trial and were randomly distributed in four groups with four replicates each .
once groups were formed five shrimps from each group were randomly selected and their hemolymph obtained and measured to set basal values of total hemocyte counts by direct counting with the neubauer chamber .,"then , additional samples from five shrimps per group were obtained for hemocyte count on days , and ."
"temperature was kept at - 25 c with a thermostat ( led w dyma , ph was approximately - 7.8 ( aqualytic , germany ) , and continuous aeration was provided at 9-6.56 ml / min .",shrimps were maintained in l tanks with continuous flow of brackish water at an approximate rate of l / h .
"to achieve this , ml of the commercial preparation was diluted in l of demineralized water .","glycyrrhizinic acid was incorporated to pelleted shrimp - feed as liquid viusid ( catalysis spain , distributed by dermaceutical m xico , s . a . de c . v . mexico city ) ."
"all dead shrimps were fixed with davidson ' s solution ( 330 ml ethylic alcohol plus ml formalin , ml glacial acetic acid and ml distilled water ) .","three milliliters of this solution was injected into the shrimps in five spots : lateral and anterior of hepatopancreas , posterior and anterior to the abdomen , and in the ventral sinus of the shrimp ."
"the analysis of the data was carried out through the cumulative kaplan - meier functions of probability with log - rank analysis ( goel et al . , ) .",results are presented as means and medians for the survivals in each group and the kaplan - meier graph of the probability of cumulative survivals .
"and table ) , amounting two times the survival median in comparison with the cuch and cuuch groups ( p = 07 ) .",the group with highest surviving median values was e1 ( see fig .
"as the trial progressed values in all groups except the cuuch group , showed a steady decay in the mean number of total hemocytes .","however , no statistically significant difference among them was detected ( see table ) ."
the resistance mechanism of shrimps to wssv and other viruses is incompletely understood .,"various studies on how shrimp survives to viral infections state that the individual immune processes play a key role , such as infiltration , phagocytosis and encapsulation of viruses within a given tissue ( durand et al . , ; momoyama et al . , ) ."
"thus , our observations are not conclusive ; important variations in the number of hemocytes in various studies have been reported ( kim et al . , ; sonnenholzner et al . , ) , and also variation in hemocyte apoptosis has been described in shrimps with resistance to wssv virus ( granja et al . , ) .","hence , further research is needed to clarify the role of hemocytes in wssv surviving shrimps ."
this will greatly facilitate its use since drug residues should not be a concern .,"also , glycyrrhizic acid plus mineral and vitamin components in the commercial preparation added as in - feed treatment to shrimps in this study has been regarded as a nutraceutical preparation by secretaria de salud ( ministry of health ) in mexico ."
"clinical signs and lesions may be mild , as in porcine neonatal colitis ( songer and anderson , ; songer , ) , but range to elevated leukocyte count , abdominal pain , profuse watery diarrhea , anorexia , lethargy , and death in humans .","collective pathology is comprised of pseudomembrane formation , inflammation , necrosis , and an intercryptal exudate of neutrophils and fibrin ( ' ' volcano lesions ' ' ) ( keel and songer , ) ."

cells were inoculated with fractions diluted in imdm and then incubated at c for h in an atmosphere of % co .,"the cytotoxin titer was the reciprocal of the highest dilution producing % cytopathic effect , and its specificity was confirmed in parallel assays in which toxins were neutralized with goat polyclonal antitoxic antibodies prepared commercially ( antibodies , inc . , davis , ca , u . s . a . ) ."
"one calf received only tcda , another received only tcdb , and the remaining calf received tcda and tcdb .","after injection , incisions were closed and the animals maintained under anesthesia for - 6 h , at which time they were euthanized by pentobarbital overdose ."
"fifty - eight ( 22.9% ) stool samples from diarrheic calves contained toxins , ( 25.3% ) yielded isolates of c . difficile ( table ) and ( 37.2% ) were positive by either method ( table ) .","chi - square analysis revealed a significant ( p < 5 ) effect of bacteriologic culture results on toxin detection results ; culture positive samples were more likely to be toxin positive ( 26 of , %) and culture negative samples were more commonly toxin negative ( table ) ."
"this nearly twofold higher rate of infection in diarrheic calves was not surprising , but the substantial rate of toxin positivity in nondiarrheic calves was unanticipated .","toxin positives were no more common among diarrheic calves than among nondiarrheic animals , but the former were more likely to be culture positive ( table ) ."

positive clinical outcomes seem unlikely for agents with an mic higher than recommended doses .,"high mics reported for cephalosporins ( dzink and bartlett , ; chow et al . , ; post and songer , ) mirror our results for ceftiofur ( mic mg / ml ) ."
"lesions in loops inoculated with tcdb were somewhat more severe , and included multifocal , ulcerative enteritis in the duodenum and the jejunum , marked villous necrosis in the ileum , and neutrophil infiltration into the small intestinal mucosa .","mucus , fibrin , neutrophils , and sloughed epithelial cells accumulated in the lumen of a loop in mid - spiral colon ( table ) ."
"gross examination revealed no fluid accumulation in control loops , but tcda and tcdb caused fluid accumulation in loops in the jejunum , the ileum , and the colon ; tcda and tcdb inoculated together produced similar effects in the ileum and the colon only .",detection of toxins in the colon in field cases and fluid accumulation in response to tcda and tcdb intoxication in colonic loops suggests that the diarrheagenic mechanism is toxin - based .

"to elucidate the potential causes of the increase in cd4 + c + i - iel with age , we analyzed the specificity of the cd4 + c + i - iel and influence of intestinal micro flora on the increase in this subset in aged rats .",the purified cd4 + c + i - iel proliferated in response to dnak [ escherichia coli ( e . coli ) hsp70 ] in the presence of mitomycin - c ( mmc ) - treated syngeneic spleen cells .
"furthermore , environmental antigens including intestinal microflora and food antigens are also responsible for the skewed eansion of the t cell repertoire in the periphery , especially in the gut - associated tissues ( galt ) .","known to develop along extrathymic pathways , resulting in the generation of an additional t cell repertoire outside the thymus ."

"our results with aged germfree rats , fed a cl - 2 diet or home - made diets suggest that stimulation with intestinal microflora , rather than antigens present in a cl - 2 diet , is important for the eansion of the cd4 + c + i - iel .","the second possibility is that the different diets may cause differences in the composition of the microflora , which may affect the selection of cd4 + c + i - iel ."
it is assumed that the c + i - jel may differentiate to cd4 + c + i - iel at the local site of intestine under the influence of stimulation with intestinal microflora .,"on the other hand , there is evidence that activation and culturing of human cd4 + t cell clones in il - 4 resulted in the acquisition of c due to its de novo synthesis ."
the cytolytic activity of i - iel is known to be regulated by externally derived stimuli via a specific functional interaction between i - iel and gut - associated antigens .,"therefore , cd4 + c + i - lel may contain cells responding to the bacterial antigens in a mhc class i - restricted c - dependent manner ."

"therefore , the dynamics of oocyst shedding can be influenced in part by limiting eure among calves and delaying the onset of fecal oocyst shedding .","the pattern of fecal shedding over time for all calves shedding oocysts was curvilinear ; the number of oocysts increased with time , reached a peak , and declined ."
"currently , the relationship between the magnitude of oral eure and fecal oocyst shedding is not well described in calves .","in this study , we eerimentally challenged neonatal dairy calves with c . parvum oocysts and reported the probability of fecal oocyst shedding , as well as the pattern of fecal shedding over time and the factors affecting this pattern ."
forty three calves were purchased at birth from a local dairy farm and enrolled in the study as they were born .,control calves ( n = 7 ) were enrolled concurrently with test calves ( n = ) .
control calves also served as sentinels for cross contamination from test calves and to help maintain quality assurance in data collection and husbandry practices .,"to prevent cross contamination , calves were fed and bedded in the same order ( youngest to oldest ) each day , each calf stall had dedicated equipment and supplies , and all study personnel used single - use personal protective equipment when entering each calf stall ."

higher magnitudes of eure exhibited more variability in the range of fecal oocyst shedding ( table ) .,figure shows the distributions of the total amount of oocysts counted per gram of feces among the different dose magnitudes .
"probability of onset of fecal shedding post - challenge in calves dosed with ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , or ( d ) c . parvum oocysts of days to the onset of fecal shedding ( p =0 . 005 ) .","however , there was an inverse relationship between the log - total amount of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight and the number onset of shedding ( days post - challenge ) fig ."
"reports an overall mean time to onset of fecal shedding across all dose magnitudes of days , which is similar to our reported median time .","in our study , however , the mean time to onset of fecal shedding was slightly greater than in moore ' s study , with the two lowest dose groups having a mean of days , and the two highest dose groups having a mean of days ."
"while it was not evaluated in this study , it is possible that the autoinfective stage of the parasite life cycle may cause a delay in the onset of fecal shedding at lower infectious doses .","infected calves , in turn , void readily infective resistant oocysts into the surrounding environment ."
"future studies will be focused on the impact of delayed fecal shedding and reduced dose magnitudes on fecal oocyst shedding , as well as on delineating the dose - response relationship and determining the id for fecal shedding in dairy calves .","instead , an integrated approach to the prevention of cryptosporidiosis in calves should be undertaken in order to address parasite , calf , and environmental factors through the provision of clean and dry housing and an appropriate plane of nutrition ."
calves exhibit the same pattern of fecal shedding over time regardless of dose magnitude ; .,"across the four magnitudes of eure ( 1 , , , or ) , there is a difference in the onset and cessation of fecal oocyst shedding and in the log - total number of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight but no difference in the duration of fecal oocyst shedding ; ."
"we evaluated the occurrence and clinical outcomes of hrv species infections in two distinct populations , immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients .",- 7 hrv species and their associated clinical outcomes in different patient groups are not well defined .

"for each outbreak , we defi ned the initial source or sources of the fi rst public communication as the individual , organization , or website that fi rst publicly communicated information regarding the disease threat ( locally or internationally , orally or in writing ) .","the study database consisted of unique human infectious disease outbreak events collected from disease outbreak news , published online by the world health organization during - 2009 ."
the effect of the initial reporting source on the timeliness of outbreak communication was quantifi ed by using negative binomial regression after adjusting for geographic region and whether the outbreak occurred before or after sars .,"these variables were included in the model on the basis of a priori assumptions that public health infrastructure can vary by geographic and political region and that new pandemic preparedness strategies , including use of informal information to initiate public health responses , were developed in response to the sars epidemic ."
"of all initial outbreak reports identifi ed , were excluded from analysis for of the following reasons ( figure ( 85% ) of the excluded reports were missing information on the estimated outbreak start date ; ( 15% ) were not found in the promed - mail archives ; and ( 1% ) outbreak estimated start date occurred after the date of public communication of the outbreak .","of the ( 66% ) outbreaks included in analysis , ( 61% ) were fi rst publicly communicated by governmental sources , and ( 39% ) were fi rst communicated by nongovernmental sources ."
the effect of missing data was assessed in sensitivity analyses for all outbreaks for which we had an estimated outbreak start date ( 17 of ) .,"additionally , multivariate modeling showed no signifi cant difference after covariates were adjusted for ( incidence rate ratio [ irr ] 5 , % ci 7-1.18 ) ( table ) ."
"examination of temporal trends over the study period ( figure ) showed that nongovernmental sources generally communicated outbreak signals to the public faster after , although the trend did not reach statistical signifi cance ( irr = 6 , % ci 1-1.01 ) .","governmental sources , in contrast , made signifi cant improvements in lessening the time in which they publicly communicated initial outbreak signals ( irr = 4 , % ci 1-0.97 ) ."
the lack of statistically signifi cant differences in initial communication timeliness by source is probably attributable to a lack of statistical power rather than a lack of effect .,"though the differences varied , nongovernmental sources tended to report outbreaks faster than governmental sources when we compared outbreaks before and after sars , or by who - defi ned region ."
"our results also show that these sources made statistically signifi cant improvements in reporting early warnings of outbreak threats more rapidly to the public , which might result in part from a shift toward automated , electronic methods that improve the timeliness of communication .","it is possible that enhancements in nongovernmental outbreak reporting systems also contributed to improvements in governmental outbreak reporting timeliness over the study period , but we were unable to test this assumption with the current data ."

an r software package makes the methods and data presented here freely available .,our work highlights the limitations and challenges associated with estimating absolute and relative cfrs in practice .
a relative cfr is defined as the cfr of one group divided by that of a reference group .,"the case fatality ratio ( cfr ) , a measure of the virulence of an infectious disease , is the fraction of cases that die after contracting the disease ."
in the pandemic of influenza a ( h1n1 ) we have a prime example .,"once the severity of the disease has been established , the relative cfr takes on primary importance as it becomes the guiding principle for targeting interventions to those populations that are most at risk of severe outcomes ."
"in many settings , nonfatal cases will go undetected either because of mild symptoms or insufficient public health surveillance infrastructure .","because an accurate and precise estimate of the relative cfr depends on complete observation of the number of cases and deaths in an outbreak , reliable data can often be difficult to find or collect ."
"due to variation in the host and the disease , the cfr may vary across a population .","for example , one group of individuals may be more or less likely to succumb to a disease than others because of previous eure or an underlying condition ."
we define a typology of reporting rates for fatal and nonfatal cases that can be used to classify surveillance systems .,we use this typology to determine conditions under which the relative cfr is identifiable .
"( for now , we assume that the onset time of all deaths is known and that survival time is always shorter than the reporting interval , i . e . , deaths are reported in the same interval in which they fall sick .",we relax this assumption in our discussion of varying survival times in section ) .
we assume the following reporting rates for time t and group j : tj is the probability a recovered case is reported and tj is the probability a dead case is reported .,"the cfr , p tj , is the probability of death , conditional on being a case ."
if a recovered case is reported then by that we mean it is counted as a case and is included in the denominator but not the numerator of the cfr .,"on the other hand , if a dead case is reported , by that we mean it is counted as both a case and a death and accordingly is included in both the numerator and the denominator of the cfr ."
we return to our central question : what conditions or assumptions allow us to estimate an absolute or relative cfr ?,"we assume that tj and tj vary independently across groups and times and that p tj = p j , i . e . , the group - specific cfr stays constant over time ."
"an increase in this observed relative cfr over time could be due to any number of factors : an increase in death reporting in group a , an increase in case reporting in group b , a decrease in case reporting in group a , a decrease in death reporting in group b , an actual change in the relative cfr , or some combination of all these factors .","without some assumptions on how the case reporting rates vary over group and time , the relative cfr itself is unidentifiable ."
"in a general model , we make no assumptions about how the reporting rates vary by t and j .","in this scenario , both the absolute and relative cfrs are unidentifiable ."
we define the na ve estimator for group j as .,the na ve estimator for the absolute cfr is based on the observed case counts .
"under certain conditions , a slightly modified version of this model can lead to estimates of the relative cfr .","second , the multinomial probabilities are nonlinear functions of the parameters of interest ."
"in the context of an outbreak , where surveillance and public awareness of a disease change over time , a major weakness of the na ve estimator is that it does not adjust for time - varying rates of case reporting .","in this section , we develop a model which , under certain conditions , provides accurate estimates of the relative cfr ."
"however , the sum in the denominator of the probability of death will make this conditional binomial model hard to fit in practice because the likelihood contains nonlinear functions of the parameters .","at each ( t , j ) pair , we say that d tj follows a binomial distribution of size n tj and success probability ."
"constant proportion of reporting rates - in this class of models , we assume that tj = k tj .","under these assumptions about reporting rates , the model in equation reduces to"
"complete fatality reporting - in this model , we assume that tj = t and tj = .","this model is a subset of the covariate - independent model , but it represents an interesting special case ."
these methods can be extended to account for incomplete observation of deaths due to the variable survival times from the time of infection .,"real - time application of this method is dependent on death occurring in response to an acute infection , as with a disease such as influenza , where most deaths would be eected to occur within a fixed number , l , weeks of infection ."
"to test the performance of our proposed estimators in a wide range of circumstances , we conducted several simulation studies .","in the central scenario , a population eeriences an epidemic made up of staggered outbreaks in two distinct subgroups of the population ."
"second , we compared the performance of the na ve , reporting - rate - adjusted and lag - adjusted estimators when reporting rates changed over time and when the time of onset for deaths was unobserved but the survival distribution was assumed to be known .","third , we tested the sensitivity of our model to the assumption that the p j are small ."
we considered scenarios where the reporting rates t and t follow a step function with a changepoint halfway through the outbreak .,"for a fixed set of reporting rates , t and t , we simulated and analyzed outbreak datasets ."
"the results , given in table , show that while the reporting - rate - adjusted estimator consistently performed well , with minimal bias across all models , the na ve estimator ' s performance was more erratic .","in some cases , notably the constant proportion models , the na ve estimator was close to unbiased ."
"the na ve , reporting - rate - adjusted and lag - adjusted estimators were calculated for each dataset .",the lag - adjusted estimator was computed three times assuming different discrete survival distributions .
"however , in these cases the lag - adjusted estimator was less biased on average and had a lower mse than the reporting - rate - adjusted estimator .","when the true survival distribution was long but we assumed a short distribution , we underestimated the true relative cfr ."
"the relative cfr between the groups was held fixed at , and the larger of the two cfrs was allowed to vary from to .",we used the same data - generating process as in the previous simulations to generate simulated datasets with case and death counts for two subgroups of the population .
influenza was made a reportable disease in september of and there are virtually no records of cases or deaths prior to this time .,"the annual report of the state board of health of maryland for the year ending december st , provides counts of influenza cases and deaths for the final months of ( maryland state board of health , ) ."
"data on these county - level characteristics were obtained from the state board of health annual report , u . s . census data , and an article on hospitals in the united states ( anonymous . , ; maryland state board of health , ; department of commerce , usa , ) .","because the time period of reporting ( 1 month ) is generally thought to be greater than most survival times for influenza , we did not additionally adjust for prolonged survival after symptom onset ."
"we sorted the eight counties by percentage of the population that was not native - born white ( range : - 36.6% ) , a proxy for socioeconomic status .","it has been shown that socioeconomic status of geographical regions was associated with mortality from influenza in ( murray et al . , ) ."
we find that the counties with a higher proportion of white population have on average lower cfrs than counties with higher proportions of minorities .,"in figure b , the percent nonwhite population for each county is plotted against the adjusted estimate of the relative cfr with a linear regression line drawn through the data ."
"second , differential case or death reporting in the counties may violate the assumption of covariate independence and lead to biased estimates of the relative cfr .","for example , if the case reporting rate was higher in counties with higher white population , this may increase the denominator for estimating the cfr when compared with the other counties , leading to a reduction in the estimate of the relative cfr ."
"however , outbreak settings often generate data that are incomplete , where both recovered and fatal cases go unreported .","in these situations , it is important to understand the assumptions necessary to identify an absolute or relative cfr , and to what extent those assumptions are realistic ."
"first , a table ( see table ) elucidates the structure of the observed and unobserved data .","second , our typology of reporting rates provides a simple classification scheme for disease surveillance systems ."
"for example , a framework could define reporting rates without conditioning on the outcome status .","although our model for a surveillance system reporting framework is general and applicable to a wide range of settings , other setups may be worthy of consideration ."
"this may not be case with an emerging pathogen , as disease treatment and management may improve as clinical and epidemiological understanding of the disease evolves ( yip et al . , ) .",we also assume that the cfr does not change over time .
this could be achieved by inclusion of more covariates directly in the glm framework or by fitting a multilevel model .,"either way , the ability to test whether there is evidence that the cfr is different between two locations ( while controlling for a second covariate ) could be a helpful addition to this model ."
"because disease outbreaks are often only partially observed , estimating absolute and relative cfrs remains a challenging problem for epidemiologists and public health officials .",the methods developed in this article contribute a new set of tools for obtaining accurate estimates of the relative cfr in some scenarios .
panel b plots the estimated relative cfrs against the percent of the county ' s population whose race is not native - born white .,the linear regression line is drawn through the points to illustrate an observed association between these two variables .

"so , dsrna can be designed to repress target gene eression through the activation of the rnai pathway in the cell .",", rnai is a phenomenon whereby - 23 basepair doublestranded ( ds ) rnas can mediate degradation of rna in a sequencespecific manner ."
"to date , rnai approaches have been widely used in studies of human diseases including cancers , neurogenerative and viral infectious diseases .",recent work has also shown that selected sirnas can effectively inhibit sars - cov replication in cultured cells .
"they first tested two solutions for delivery of the reporter plasmid and the sirna duplexes into mouse lungs and subsequently used d5w , a glucose solution , for delivery of sirna duplexes to rhesus macaque lungs .",the authors selected two distinct sirnas ( named sics2 and ) that were shown to be effective in cultured cells and confirmed the effectiveness in mouse lungs using a very sensitive luciferase reporter vector ( pci - scluc ) .
observed that the sirnas they designed could suppress sars - like symptoms .,they found that all the monkeys in the treatment groups showed less severe symptoms than the control groups .
"furthermore , their data showed three of the four animals in each of the three sirna - treated groups free of sars - cov rna in the oropharyngeal swab specimens , although one of the four monkeys in each group had no change of the sars - cov rna copy numbers .",these results indicated that the sirna treatments either inhibited sars - cov replication or blocked the spread of the virus within the lungs .
"although this approach is obviously not a cure for sars since the treated animals also developed sars symptoms , it can be used as a complementary strategy to reduce the severity of the disease and to low the viral load in patients .","therefore , this study has important implications on strategies for combating emerging infectious diseases such as sars ."
"first , it remains to be shown what percentage of the airway epithelial cells of the treated animals take - up the sirnas and whether sirna delivery efficiency can be further enhanced .","however , while this work provided a plausible rationale to add sirnas to the arsenal for combating sars , this approach should be further elored ."
"thereafter , the mice were sacrificed and weighed , and the testis was examined for pathological changes .",methods sixty male kunming mice received the following treatments by gavage : normal saline solution ( control ) ; arsenic trioxide ( ato ; mg / kg ) ; gspe ( 400 mg / kg ) ; ato + gspe ( 100 mg / kg ) ; ato + gspe ( 200 mg / kg ) and ato + gspe ( 400 mg / kg ) .

some reactive oxidative species c act as cellular messengers in redox signaling .,oxidative stress reflects an imbalance between the systemic manifestation of reactive oxygen species and a biological system ' s ability to readily detoxify reactive intermediates and repair the resulting damage .
"when nrf2 is not ubiquitinated , it accumulates in the cytoplasm and translocates into the nucleus .","in the nucleus , nrf2 forms a heterodimer with a small maf protein and binds to the antioxidant response element ( are ) in the upstream promoter region of many antioxidative genes , and thus initiates their transcription ."
the findings in this study can provide empirical evidence for the mechanism of gspe .,this study was designed to detect the combined effect of gavage gspe and arsenic on male mice to elucidate the role of nrf2 signaling in the combined effect .
"the mice received a standard laboratory diet composed of % ground corn meal , % ground beans , % bran , % corn oil , % casein , % mineral mixture , and % vitamin mixture , and supplied with water ad libitum throughout the eerimental period .",the animals were kept in well - ventilated cages in a temperature - controlled room at - 25 c under specific pathogen - free conditions on a - h light / dark cycle .

"testes and accessory sex organs were weighed to the nearest milligram on a shimadzu electronic balance ( model bl - 2 2 0 h , tokyo , japan ) .",the index weight of the organs was calculated by the following formula : index weightrgan weight / body weight .
the percentage of abnormal sperm was scored in to separate fields using % trypan blue by the method of okamura .,"sperm viability ( live / dead ratio ) and sperm density were calculated by the method of nahas and eressed as percentage viability and sperm / ml , respectively ."
sections of - m thickness were cut using a rotary microtome .,"the sections were processed and passed through a graded alcohol series , stained with hematoxylin and eosin , cleared in xylene , and examined microscopically according to previously described methods ."
"tissue homogenates were prepared by soaking testis tissues in a lysis buffer containing mmol / l tris ( ph ) , mmol / l nacl , % triton x - 100 , and the protein inhibitors sodium pyrophosphate , - glycerophosphate , edta , na vo , and leupeptin ( beyotime biotechnology , shanghai , china ) , and then homogenized with a tissuelyser ( qiagen , valencia , ca , usa ) .","the protein concentration in the homogenate was measured with a bradford protein assay kit ( beyotime biotechnology , shanghai , china ) ."
"briefly , the samples were treated with thiobarbituric acid ( tba ) , which produces a red compound with an absorption maximum at nm in the presence of mda .","the concentration of mda was calculated by comparing the absorbance to that produced by the control standard , 1,3 , 3 tetraethoxypropane ."
the t - aoc of the samples was determined by comparison with the control standard .,"this kit utilized antioxidants in the samples to reduce fe + to fe + , which was chelated with porphyrin to produce a purple complex that was quantified by measuring the absorbance at nm ."
"the data were analyzed using spss software for windows version ( spss inc . , chicago , il , usa ) , and a result of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant .","anova was used to detect the differences among the low - , medium - , and high - dose gspe groups , followed by bonferroni ' s multiple comparison test to determine whether the differences were significant ."
the body weight of the ato group decreased gradually over the course of treatment ( figure ) .,"the body weight , testes weight , and testes somatic index of mice treated with ato were significantly decreased in comparison with the control group ( p < 0.05 ) ."
a significant interaction was found between the effects of ato and gspe on sperm count ( p < 0.001 ) and sperm abnormalities ( p < 0.001 ) .,"there were no significant differences between the gspe group and the control group for sperm count or sperm abnormalities , whereas the ato group had a significantly lower sperm count ( p < 0.05 ) and a higher rate of sperm abnormalities ( p < 0.05 ) than the control group ."
"a significant interaction was found between the effects of ato and gspe on mda level , - ohdg level , and gsh activity ( all p < 0.001 ) .","as the dose of gspe was increased , mda and - ohdg levels increased significantly ( p < 0.05 ) , and gsh activity decreased significantly ."
morphological changes in the testis in the treatment groups are shown in figure .,"as eected , ato administration caused a reduction in germ cell number , necrosis of sperm , congestion of interstitial blood vessels , and degeneration and necrosis of germ cells lining the seminiferous tubules ( figure c ) ."
"the groups treated with ato + gspe ( 100 mg / kg , mg / kg , or mg / kg ) showed elevated eression of genes related to the nrf2 signaling pathway in comparison with the other groups ( p < 0.05 ; figure ) .","interestingly , treatment with gspe also significantly increased the eression levels of ho , gst , and nqo1 in comparison with the control group ( p < 0.05 ) ."
"our study suggested that eure to arsenic reduced the quality of sperm in mice , and substantial pathological changes were clearly observed in the testis after weeks of eure to ato .","arsenic disrupts meiosis and post - meiotic stages of spermatogenesis , and acute arsenic eure causes rapid and extensive disruption of spermatogenesis in mice ."
"in comparisons among the groups , we found that , in the ato + gspe groups , these parameters fell to levels between those observed in the ato and control groups .","using a general linear model , our study found significant interactions between gspe and ato treatment effects on body weight and testis weight , sperm count , mda level , - ohdg level , and gsh activity ."
"furthermore , gspe significantly decreased mda and - ohdg levels , and increased gsh activity .","based on these measured parameters and coordinated mrna eression of nrf2 signaling pathway components after gpse eure , our findings in mice suggest that gspe activates nrf2 signaling , which alleviates oxidative stress damage in the testis , and thus counteracts arsenic - induced reproductive toxicity ."
"sequences of these intrinsically disordered proteins ( idps ) and idp regions ( idprs ) are characterized by a number of specific features , such as low overall hydrophobicity and high net charge which makes these proteins predictable .","idps / idprs possess large hydrodynamic volumes , low contents of ordered secondary structure , and are characterized by high structural heterogeneity ."
"these many crystal structures reinforced a static view of functional protein , where a rigid active site of an enzyme can be viewed as a sturdy lock that provides an exact fit to only one key , a specific and unique substrate .","despite numerous limitations , this lock - and - key model was an extremely fruitful concept that was responsible for the creation of modern protein science ."
"in fact , an incomplete list of terms coined in the literature to describe these proteins includes floppy , pliable , rheomorphic , flexible , mobile , partially folded , natively denatured , natively unfolded , , natively disordered , intrinsically unstructured , , intrinsically denatured , intrinsically unfolded , intrinsically disordered , vulnerable , chameleon , malleable , d , protein clouds , dancing proteins , proteins waiting for partners , and several other names often representing different combinations of "" natively / naturally / inherently / intrinsically "" with "" unfolded / unstructured / disordered / denatured "" among several others .","although the phenomenon of biological functionality without stable structure was repeatedly observed , for a long time it was unnoticed by a wide audience because the authors frequently invented new terms to describe their protein of interest ."
"the goals of this review are : ( i ) to outline some recent advances in the field of idps / idprs ; ( ii ) to illustrate the usefulness of intrinsic disorder for protein function ; ( iii ) to show that intrinsic disorder can affect different levels of protein structural organization ; ( iv ) to indicate intimate involvement of intrinsic disorder in pathogenesis of various maladies ; ( v ) to emphasize the exceptional structural heterogeneity of idps / idprs and to show that idps are definitely much more structurally complex than random coillike polypeptides ; ( vi ) to accentuate that although this structural heterogeneity is very important for protein functionality , it represents a crucial hurdle for structural characterization of idps ; ( vii ) to stress that new eerimental and computational approaches and new theories and models are crucially needed for future progression of this field and protein science in general .","these and other points highlight the current state of the field , where further advances in understanding of the "" biology "" of idps still waits for "" physics , "" with "" physics "" now being new theories , instrumentation , and analytical approaches ."
"based on the analysis of amino acid scales , a novel amino acid scale , top - idp ( trp , phe , tyr , ile met , leu , val , asn , cys , thr , ala , gly , arg , asp , his , gln , lys , ser , glu , and pro ) , was built to provide ranking for the tendencies of the amino acid residue to promote order or disorder .","and more than composition - based attributes ( e . g . , all possible combinations having one to four amino acids in the group ) it has been concluded that ordered and disordered proteins and regions can be discriminated using many of these attributes ."
"in other words , this sharp jump in the disorder content in proteomes associated with the transition from prokaryotic to eukaryotic cells suggests that the increase in the morphological complexity of the cell paralleled the increased usage of intrinsic disorder .","the variability of disorder content in unicellular eukaryotes and rather weak correlation between disorder status and organism complexity ( measured as the number of different cell types ) is likely related to the wide variability of their habitats , with especially high levels of disorder being found in parasitic host - changing protozoa , the environment of which changes dramatically during their life - span ."
"for decades , the actual size of "" foldable "" sequence space continues to be unsolved mystery despite a large body of theoretical , biochemical , and computational work that aims to unravel the relationship between a protein ' s primary sequence and its resulting d structure .","in other words , a sequence space of a foldable protein ( or "" foldable "" sequence space ) is noticeably smaller than the entire sequence space available for a random polypeptide chain ."
"since the unique d - structure of an ordered single - domain protein is defined by the interplay between all ( or almost all ) of its residues , one could eect that the structure - coding potential is homogeneously distributed within its amino acid sequence .","also , the existence of a noticeable sequencestructure heterogeneity of idps should be emphasized ."
"as a result , different parts of a molecule are ordered ( or disordered ) to a different degree .","in fact , a typical idp / idpr contains a multitude of elements coding for potentially foldable , partially foldable , differently foldable , or not foldable at all protein segments ."
", , , , based on these observations , the protein functionality was ascribed to at least three major protein conformational states , ordered , molten globular , and coil - like , , indicating that functional idps can be less or more compact and possess smaller or larger amount of flexible secondary / tertiary structure .",", , , , , roughly at the same time , it was emphasized that the extended idps ( known as natively unfolded proteins ) do not represent a uniform entity but contain two broad structural classes , native coils and native pre - molten globules ."
"it is important to remember that even the most ordered proteins do not resemble "" solid rocks "" and have some degree of flexibility .","notably , in this representation , there is no boundary between ordered proteins and idps , and , the structure - disorder space of a protein is considered as a continuum ."
"ordered proteins are taken as rigid rocks , whereas idps are considered as completely structure - less entities , kind of cooked noodles .","bottom half : a continuous emission spectrum representing the fact that functional proteins can extend from fully ordered to completely structure - less proteins , with everything in between ."
"of flexible and charged polymers , whereas the behavior of an ordered protein is rather uneected ( i . e . , due to the existence of the native ensemble that for well - folded , ordered proteins can be approximated as a harmonic well around a unique , welldefined equilibrium structure ) .","therefore , one definitely should keep in mind that the "" unusual "" biophysics of extended idps / idprs has its roots in the usual polymer physics of highly charged and flexible polypeptides ."
"furthermore , if such idps / idprs possess polyampholytic nature , their globular state could be additionally stabilized by electrostatic interactions between the oppositely charged sidechains .",these idps / idprs form collapsed structures since the driving force responsible for the collapse is not overcome by the intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the charged side - chains and by their favorable free energies of solvation .
"in general , the conformational behavior of idps is characterized by the low cooperativity ( or the complete lack thereof ) of the denaturant - induced unfolding , lack of the measurable excess heat absorption peak ( s ) characteristic for the melting of ordered proteins , "" turned out "" response to heat and changes in ph , and the ability to gain structure in the presence of various binding partners .",the analysis of the temperature effects on structural properties of several extended idps revealed that native coils and native pre - molten globules partially fold as the temperature is increased .
", on the other hand , the exterior regions of tm proteins are much more apolar than the exteriors of water - soluble proteins .","for example , similar to typical water soluble proteins , the tm regions of membrane proteins are often highly structured , containing a - helices or b - structure , which are especially likely to occur due to the low dielectric constant values within the membrane bilayers ."
another illustrative example of the specific disorderrelated and environment - dependent sequence features is given by archaeal proteins .,", based on the levels of predicted disordered residues , archaeal proteins can be grouped into three classes , with ranges of the disordered residue content of - 21% , % - 32% , and % - 38% ( see fig ."
", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , some of these advantages are :",", , , , , the conformational plasticity of idps / idprs provides them with a wide spectrum of exceptional functional advantages over the functional modes of ordered proteins and domains ."
"functionally , idps / idprs were grouped in at least six broad classes based on the mode of action .",", , , , , , , , , functions of many idps / idprs rely on interactions with specific binding partners , and many idps / idprs tend to undergo disorder - to - order transitions as a result of binding to their specific targets ."
"among intriguing protein functions relying on intrinsic disorder are moonlighting activities , actions of hub proteins , , , , and scaffolding functions .",", since all these functions illustrate the notions that the intrinsic disorder concept represents a universal skeleton key ( or lock - pick ) that helps unlocking seemingly unresolvable mysteries of protein science and therefore can be considered as a new ariadne ' s thread that helps navigate the unusual twists of the sophisticated relationships between protein sequence , structure , and function , they are considered in some detail below ."
unique catalytic function of a protein is believed to be dictated by its unique d structure .,this axiom constitutes a cornerstone of the lock - and - key paradigm and it seemed to be able to sustain the furious attack on protein structure - function relationship initiated by the discovery of idps and hybrid proteins with ordered domains and idprs .
"in a sharp contrast to this common wisdom supported by a wide array of specific examples , several enzymes were shown to be much more dynamic than the catalytic machines are eected to be , clearly possessing , in their precatalytic states , many characteristic properties of molten globules and retaining unusually high flexibility in structurally defined enzyme - ligand complexes .","from this viewpoint , the presence of intrinsic disorder is eected to be poorly compatible with enzymatic catalysis , which requires a well - organized environment in the active site of the enzyme in order to facilitate the formation of the transition state of the chemical reaction to be catalyzed ."
"of these three enzymatic molten globules ureg is the only natural molten globular enzyme known to date , since both circularly permuted dhfr and monomeric mjcm were obtained as a result of some genetic manipulations .","although the number of known native molten globules with enzymatic activity is small , their existence provides an interesting hint on early protein evolution ."
"some of these complexes are relatively static , resemble complexes of ordered proteins , and , therefore are suitable for the structure determination by x - ray crystallography .","due to their lack of rigid structure , combined with the high level of intrinsic dynamics and almost unrestricted flexibility at various structure levels in the non - bound state , as well as due to the unique capability to adjust to structure of the binding partner , idps are characterized by a very diverse range of binding modes , creating a multitude of unusual complexes , many of which are not attainable by ordered proteins ."
an additional factor which can help holding a dynamic complex together could be a weak longrange attraction between protein molecules .,"in other words , in this staccato - type interaction mode , an disordered protein rapidly changes multiple binding sites while probing binding site ( s ) of its partner ."
"however , functions of some ordered proteins require local or even global unfolding of a unique protein structure .",the most common outcome of these function - related structural changes is the overall increase in the amount of ordered structure .
"for example , functions ascribed to a - synuclein , a protein involved in several neurodegenerative disorders , include binding fatty acids and metal ions ; regulation of certain enzymes , transporters , and neurotransmitter vesicles ; and regulation of neuronal survival ( reviewed in ref .","in fact , many of the proteins associated with the conformational disorders are also involved in recognition , regulation , and cell signaling ."
"it has been emphasized that such molecular processes as unfolded protein response , protein transport , synaptic transmission , and transcription are implicated in the pathology of polyq diseases .","importantly , more than transcription - related factors have been reported to interact with pathological polyq proteins ."
"since many proteins associated with various human diseases are either completely disordered or contain long disordered regions , , and since some of these disease - related idps / idprs are involved in recognition , regulation , and signaling , these proteins / regions clearly represent novel potential drug targets .","due to failure to recognize the important role of disorder in protein function , current and evolving methods of drug discovery suffer from an overly rigid view of protein function ."
targeting disorder - based interactions should enable the development of more effective drug discovery techniques .,"there are at least two potential approaches for the inhibition of the disorder - based interactions , where small molecule either bind to the binding site of the ordered partner to outcompete the idps / idprs or interacts directly with the idp / idpr ."
", this successful nutlin story marks the potential beginning of a new era , the signaling - modulation era , in targeting drugs to protein - protein interactions .","when one of the nutlins was given orally to mice , a % inhibition of tumor growth compared to the control was induced ."
several small molecules were found to inhibit the c - myc - max dimer formation .,"since the deregulation of c - myc is related to many types of cancer , the disruption of the c - myc - max dimeric complex is one of the approaches for c - myc inhibition ."
", , this suggests that disorder , with its ability to be implemented in various signaling , recognition , and regulation pathways and networks , is important for the maintenance of life in eukaryotic and especially muticellular eukaryotic organisms .",", , , also , the finding that alternatively spliced regions of mrna code for idprs much more often than for structured regions suggests that there is a linkage between alternative splicing and signaling by idprs that constitutes a plausible mechanism that could underlie and support cell differentiation , which ultimately gave rise to the multicellular eukaryotic organisms ."
"furthermore , some additional support of the validity of this hypothesis can be found in the standard genetic code ( that consists of triplets of nucleotides , codons ) , which is redundant ( 64 codons encodes for amino acids ) .","these findings go in parallel with the biosynthetic theory of the genetic code evolution suggesting that the genetic code evolved from a simpler form that encoded fewer amino acids , probably paralleled by the invention of biosynthetic pathways for new and chemically more complex amino acids ."
"there are only two noticeable exceptions from these rule , valine and leucine , which are early but order - promoting residues .","this conclusion follows from the abundance of the matching colors ( light red - red , light blue - blue , and light pinkpink ) ."
since the variability of physicochemical properties of amino acids greatly exceeds that of figure .,", such rna chaperone activities of early proteins conferred to their carriers a significant selective advantage in the rna world , where rna , which is especially prone to misfolding , , was used for both information storage and catalysis ."
"( b ) ] , where highly disordered primordial proteins with primarily rna - chaperone activities were gradually substituted by the well - folded , highly ordered enzymes that evolved to catalyze the production of all the complex "" goodies "" crucial for the independent existence of the first cellular organisms .","in other words , the global evolution of intrinsic disorder is characterized by a wavy pattern [ see fig ."
"in fact , it looks like everything is possible , and intrinsically disordered sequences may evolve faster , slower or similar to ordered sequences .",there is no simple answer to the question on the comparative evolutionary rates of ordered and idps and regions in modern organisms .
"modern protein science is at the turning point , but biology still waits for physics .","new models elaining various functions of idps , their evolution , and involvement in diseases are in great demand , together with the general theory unifying current knowledge on protein structure and function , and with novel eerimental and computational tools for focused studies of idps / idprs ."
a national control program against bovine respiratory syncytial virus ( brsv ) and bovine coronavirus ( bcv ) was launched in norway in .,a key strategy in the program is to test for presence of antibodies and protect testnegative herds from infection .
"input variables were test sensitivity , the probability of introduction through animal purchase and local transmission .","postpfree was calculated for herds that were negative in / 2014 , and updated periodically with new probabilities every three months ."
"the probability of freedom was generally high for test - negative herds immediately after testing , reflecting the high sensitivity of the tests .","it did however , decrease with time since testing , and was greatly affected by purchase of livestock ."
"brsv causes respiratory disease , mostly in young animals , but can affect cattle of all ages ( valarcher and taylor , ) .","clinical signs vary from none to severe ( valarcher and taylor , ) ."
"in early , bulk tank milk ( btm ) was collected from the majority of norwegian dairy herds and analyzed for brsv and bcv antibodies .","the program is conducted as a joint initiative amongst producer organizations , and participation is voluntary ."
"a negative herd status based on btm lasts for one year after testing , regardless of the degree of contact with other herds .","in a previous norwegian study , it was shown that spread of brsv between herds was rapid i . e ."
a flowchart was made to describe the different subsets of herds used for the different analyses ( fig .,"we had no information on herds without movements or btm samples ; hence , the total cattle population in the study region was not known ."
"this test detects brsv and bcv antibodies simultaneously using a panel of two recombinant proteins and two synthetic peptides for brsv ( brsv - a - d ) along with one recombinant protein ( bcv - a ) for bcv , as antigens .","from , all samples were analyzed with the new mvd - enferplex bcv / brsv multiplex , hereafter referred to as the multiplex ."
"furthermore , all input variables in the probability model relates to antibodies , hence , the calculated probabilities relate to presences of antibodies , and not necessarily infection or presence of virus .","all the tests detect antibodies , not the antigen itself , consequently we will in the present study use "" positive "" when referring to animals , herds or regions as having brsv and / or bcv antibodies ."
"information about herd size was retrieved from the norwegian dairy herd recording system ( ndhrs ) which in included % of norwegian dairy herds ( espetvedt et al . , ) .","in the current study , animal movements refer to movements where there is a change of owner , for which reporting is mandatory ."
"records where the source county or the source herd was missing , and could not be retrieved from other variables , were also omitted ( n = ) .","records of movements where the same animal was moved back and forth between the same two herds , or to two different recipient herds , on the same day , were omitted ( n = ) ."
"a - 50 probability of infection / freedom ) for all herds , and n was the number of animals purchased from the source herd .","where p ( d + ) a was the within - herd prevalence in the source herd , set to ( i . e ."
"as an estimate of p ( d + ) h the herd prevalence in the county of the source herd , based on the national btm screening was used .",where p ( d + ) h is the probability that the source herd is antibody positive at the herd level .
"this factor was estimated using the proportion of herds that were negative at the first sampling and positive at the last sampling , in the group that did not purchase animals , hereafter designated closed herds .","this was done separately for the two viruses and for the two counties as we knew that the prevalence , and likely the infectious pressure , was higher in the northern county ( toftaker et al . , ) ."
no prior information on herd prevalence in the region available and an equal probability of being positive and negative .,"for the first time period , the prior probability of infection ( priorpinf ) was set to , resembling testing a herd with unknown status , i . e ."
"to assess the usefulness of the developed method , the postpfree calculations for the final three month period was compared to the results from btm testing in , using a wilcon rank sum test .",bar charts were made showing the proportion of test positive herds in each quartile of postpfree .
"the national control program started in march , resulting in btm samples from herds in the study area .","on this final screening , herds ( 44.0% ) were antibody positive for brsv and herds ( 77.3% ) were antibody positive for bcv ."
"when retested in , ( 20% ) of the initially negative herds had changed status in the southern county , and ( 35% ) in the northern county .","of the closed herds ( n = ) , herds were initially test - negative for brsv in each county ."
"when retested in , ( 27% ) and seven ( 11% ) herds went from negative to positive in the northern - and southern county , respectively .","the resulting local transmission rate , pintrolocal , per three month time period for each virus is presented in table ."
"for brsv , reducing the value of pintrolocal by % gave a mean increase in postpfree of % ( sd %) , and increasing the value of pintrolocal gave a mean decrease in postpfree of % ( sd %) .","for bcv , reducing the value of pintrolocal by % gave a mean increase in postpfree of % ( sd %) , and increasing the value of pintrolocal by % gave a mean decrease in postpfree of % ( sd %) ."
in a practical sense this means that a recommended retesting at this value would capture an estimated % of the positive herds i . e .,"when assessing postpinf as a diagnostic test , the se decreased with increasing cut - off , and when 5 was used as cut - off , the se for detecting herds that were btm positive in was 6 ( 95% ci : .82 ) ."
"for bcv the se decreased with increasing cut - off as for brsv , however when using a cut - off value of 5 for postpinf the se for detecting btm positive herds in was only 5 ( 95% ci 2-0.68 ) .",at a cut - off value of the se was 3 ( 95% ci 1-0.92 ) .
"the advantage of our approach is that it offers a quantification of this decrease in confidence , through the regularly updated postpfree resulting in herd specific slopes over time based on purchase of livestock , location of the herd and herd size ( fig .","it is intuitive that the confidence of freedom from infection will decrease with time since sampling , as long as there is a risk of introduction ."
"indirect transfer via fomites is likely the most important factor , however , direct animal contact is possible e . g .","on shared pastures , or if animals are temporarily moved ( without change in ownership ) ."
differences in the importance of local transmission should therefore be investigated for different regions if the presented framework is to be applied at a national scale .,it seems likely that local differences in prevalence and geographically dependent risk factors such as herd density might cause important differences in pintrolocal .
"because we used btm testing as the "" gold standard "" the herd would be classified as a "" true positive "" in the validation .",as norwegian herds are small the purchase of a single antibody positive lactating cow will likely suffice to produce a positive btm test .
the model is therefore robust regarding choice of prior in this case .,"however , the high se of the btm antibody tests will entail a high probability of freedom immediately after testing even if the prior probability is low ."
"a stochastic approach is possible , and could potentially capture some of the uncertainty in the probability of disease .",fixed values were used for all parameters in the present study .
the model evaluation suggested that postpfree is a useful tool for updated herd probability of freedom .,"when comparing postpfree to the btm result from ( wilcon rank sum test ) , there was significant difference ( p < 1 ) between groups for both models ( brsv and bcv ) , suggesting a benefit of using postpfree instead of relying on the previous btm result alone ."
"diarrhoea in lambs and kids is often a complex , multi - factorial syndrome .",common infectious causes of diarrhoea in lambs and kids during the first month of life are of bacterial or parasite nature .
"by reviewing the literature , we provide herewith an update on the enteric viruses identified in small ruminants and eventually associated with enteric disease , on the basis of either observational or eerimental studies .",recent advances in the diagnostics and metagenomic investigations of the enteric environment have provided clues to understand the diversity of small ruminant enteric virome .
"in small ruminants , adenoviruses have been associated with both enteric and respiratory signs of various severity and adenovirusinduced disease is usually referred to as pneumo - enteritis ( belak , ) .","adenoviruses ( family adenoviridae ) are non - enveloped viruses with an icosahedral nucleocapsid of - 100 nm in size , with a double stranded dna genome of - 45 kbp in length ( davison et al . , ) ."
"the various types differ in their antigenic and biological properties ( haemagglutination spectrum , in vitro cultivation , virulence ) ( belak , ) .","although adenoviruses seem to be species - specific , isolates antigenically related to bovine adenovirus type - 2 or adenovirus type - 7 have been reported in lambs ( bel k and p lfi , ; davies and humphreys , ) ."
"prevalence of antibodies to the various ovine adenovirus types is high ( p lfi and bel k , ; adair et al . , ; lehmkuhl and hobbs , ) .",asymptomatic infections or prolonged shedding of virus after acute infection are frequent .
"eerimental inactivated bivalent vaccines proved to be safe and effective ( belak , ) , although commercial vaccines are not currently available .",prevention of the infection is based on adoption of good hygiene measures and correct management of the flock / herd .
"astroviruses are mostly associated with enteric infections in mammalians and avian species , although extraintestinal localisation and disease may occur in avian species and in some mammals ( mendez and arias , ; blomstr m et al . , ; li et al . , ) .","astroviruses are small round non - enveloped viruses , with a positive - sense poly - adenylated rna of - 7 kb in size ( mendez and arias , ) ."
"also , faecal filtrates of the eerimentally infected lamb were given orally to two further gnotobiotic lambs , which developed diarrhoea and excreted the virus ( snodgrass and gray , ) .","infections in gnotobiotic lambs with the ovine astrovirus were repeated in a distinct eeriment , and the infection determined mild diarrhoea after an incubation period of about h . astroviruses infect only mature villus epithelial cells and subepithelial macrophages in the small intestine , where they produce partial villus atrophy ."
"structural analysis and genome sequencing of the ovine astrovirus prototype confirmed that the virus is part of the mamastrovirus genus , astroviridae family ( herring et al . , ; jonassen et al . , jonassen et al . , , .","subsequent studies have revealed that the ovine astrovirus prototype is genetically unrelated to bovine astroviruses ( tse et al . , ) and that genetically diverse astroviruses may infect sheep ( reuter et al . , a ) ."
"the family bunyaviridae includes over viruses , mostly transmitted by arthropods , which are divided into five genera : hantavirus , nairovirus , orthobunyavirus , phlebovirus and tospovirus .","several bunyaviruses have been reported to infect small ruminants , but only a few are responsible for enteritis in these animals ( hub lek et al . , ) ( table ) ."

"vertical and venereal transmissions are also important ( tarlinton et al . , ) .","schmallenberg virus infection causes transient fever , diarrhoea and a decreased milk yield in adult cattle and , most notably , stillbirths and severe malformations in lambs and calves ."
"however , due to the observed genetic diversity in the capsid gene , the ovine strain ( ov / norse - wood30 / 2007 / nzl ) has been proposed as a third giii genotype , which has not been described yet in other ruminants .","also , upon sequence analysis of the capsid gene , the virus was classified within genogroup ( g ) iii , along with other bovine noroviruses ."

"in the same study , ovine enterovirus - like picornaviruses were detected in % of ( 7 / 16 ) faecal samples from lambs .","the ovine virusovine enterovirus , genus enterovirus , displays intermediate genetic features between bovine enterovirus ( enterovirus e ) and porcine enterovirus type b ( enterovirus g ) suggesting a recombinant origin , with the utr of the genome resembling bovine enteroviruses ( boros et al . , ) ( table ) ."

"the virion is - 75 nm in size , icosahedral , triple - layered and non - enveloped .","in livestock , rotaviruses are associated with severe enteric diseases in young calves , weaning and post - weaning piglets ( saif and fernandez , ) and severe enteritis in foals ( conner and darlington , ) ."
"based on their genetic and antigenic properties and the existing literature , rotaviruses may be further classified into five confirmed species , a - d , and an additional three putative candidate species , f - h ( saif and jiang , ; matthijnssens et al . , ) .","rotavirus a , rotavirus b , rotavirus c and rotavirus h have been identified in humans and animals , while rotavirus d , rotavirus e , rotavirus f and rotavirus g have been identified only in animals ( alam et al . , ; estes and kapikian , ; wakuda et al . , ) ."

"despite appreciable improvements in management practices and prevention and treatment strategies , diarrhoea is still the most common and costly syndrome affecting newborn lambs or kids ( dohoo et al . , ) .","several steps have been taken in recent years towards understanding of the role of viruses as causative agent of enteritis in these animals , with a number of novel viruses being discovered ."
"in order to ensure a thorough and informed revision of this guidance following the h1n1 pandemic , a systematic review of published and unpublished economic evaluations of preparedness strategies and interventions against influenza pandemics was conducted .","background : although public health guidelines have implications for resource allocation , these issues were not elicitly considered in previous who pandemic preparedness and response guidance ."
"the search was performed in september using electronic databases , internet search engines , reference list screening , cited reference searching , and direct communication with relevant authors .",full and partial economic evaluations considering both costs and outcomes were included .
"although most complied with the cost effectiveness guidelines , the quality of evidence was limited .","however , the data sources used were of higher quality in economic evaluations conducted after the h1n1 pandemic ."
these documents summarize the recommended who and national actions against pandemic influenza according to recognized pandemic phases .,"for some recommendations , evidence is limited to observations or epidemiological models ."
"the findings are eected to contribute to the revision of the who guidance on pandemic influenza , potentially support policymakers to make informed decisions on allocating resources effectively , and identify gaps for future research .","which is more focused on non - pharmaceutical issues and also covers conference proceedings , was also performed ."
"and cited reference searching of the first economic evaluation on this topic was also performed using web of science ( via isi web of knowledge , - 22.09.2011 ) .",additional reports were obtained through correspondence between one reviewer ( rpv ) and authors of eligible studies and conference abstracts .
free text terms in other languages were also employed when appropriate .,"the search strategies used controlled vocabulary thesaurus terms , whenever available , and relevant free text terms , including ' pandemic ' , ' h1n1 ' , ' influenza ' , ' cost benefit ' , ' cost ( s ) ' , ' cost effective ' and ' economic ( s ) ' , in different combinations ."
"second , studies were assessed according to the quality of evidence used , since it is widely recognized that the credibility of economic evaluations depends not only on the appropriateness of the methods employed but also on the input evidence .","first , they were assessed according to specific methodological and reporting practices for economic evaluation studies such as eression of perspective used , relationship between time horizon and discounting , reporting of incremental cost effectiveness ratios ( icers ) , performing uncertainty analysis , and declaration of funding support ."
"this review compared the value for money of different interventions for the prevention and control of influenza pandemics in comparison with ' no intervention ' ; however , the evaluations were conducted in different settings and timeframes .",this study converted cost effectiveness ratios into a common currency and utility unit .
the characteristics of the studies included in the analysis are summarized in table s4 .,"modified from the who and the world bank ' s classification for the containment and mitigation of influenza pandemics , table depicts that vaccination ( n = ) and antiviral drugs ( n = ) were commonly evaluated for both target groups ( specific groups , such as high risk or priority populations ) and the general population ."
"a relatively high proportion of studies described the study perspective ( s ) , selection of comparators , using discounting for costs and / or outcomes for studies with time horizon longer than one year , and performing uncertainty analyses .",table shows the extent to which the reviewed papers complied with standards for conducting and reporting economic evaluations .
"all of the studies except two were model based , adopting either dynamic or static approaches , whereas one study compared both approaches .",only one paper did not clearly state the approach used .
"( of course , the interventions that are cost effective for low income countries should also be cost effective for countries with higher incomes ) .",quarantine for household contacts seems unlikely to be cost effective even for low and middle income countries because the icer is well above the maximum ceiling threshold for upper middle income countries .
"these are epidemiological parameters and those related to natural disease progression ( infectivity , e . g . , attack rate or reproduction number ; probability of pandemic ; pandemic duration ; disease severity , e . g . , case fatality or probability of developing complications ) , those related to the intervention ( efficacy , coverage , stockpiling capacity , timing of the intervention ) , resource use and cost parameters ( healthcare costs , resources consumed , value of life , cost of intervention ) , and others ( utility and discounting rate ) .",there was no study that systematically analyzed the relative importance of the parameters .
"in general , all epidemic models have an underlying network of mixing patterns , even though this network may not be elicit .",only one study conducted after the h1n1 pandemic appears to employ real data in areas affected by the pandemic to construct a social network .
"for instance , it may be unethical to restrict travel or to introduce public communication and advisory measures for only specific population groups .",there is a lack of standard protocols for non - pharmaceutical interventions resulting in a large variability of practice across settings .
"however , we found uniform drug regimens for prophylaxis and treatment for studies conducted after the pandemic .","since different vaccination and drug regimens were examined across the selected studies , the findings on both the costs and outcomes of interventions are incomparable , especially from studies conducted before the pandemic ."
"national methodological guidelines for conducting economic evaluations exist in most of these settings and , therefore , it would affect the choice of method employed by the researchers .","to improve the comparability of future evaluations , it is important to introduce internationally accepted methodological guidelines ."
"this is because the authors of these papers assessed a wide range of pharmaceutical and non - pharmaceutical interventions and met the eligibility criterion to be included in the figure ( i . e . , presenting results in terms of incremental cost utility ratios ) ( table s8 ) .","this synthesis is dominated by only three studies , although data from out of studies were used ."
"firstly , research should be encouraged and facilitated for both the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of interventions against influenza pandemics , especially in developing countries .","to strengthen the evidence base for preparedness strategies and interventions against influenza pandemics , there are four major recommendations ."
"secondly , we recommend that future economic evaluations should apply a more transparent and systematic approach to analyze uncertainty surrounding the input parameters .","this can be achieved by using the value of information approach , namely ' eected value of perfect information for parameters ' , which is a technique to estimate the value of reducing the uncertainty around particular parameters in the model ."
a research or clinical bronchoscopy with a research bronchoalveolar lavage will be performed to obtain samples for genomic and microbiome analyses .,"participants with a confirmed diagnosis of sarcoidosis undergo a baseline visit with self - administered questionnaires , chest computed tomography , pulmonary function tests , and blood and urine testing ."
"despite progress in the understanding of the genetic and immunologic basis of sarcoidosis , the determinants of its disease manifestations and clinical course remain unclear , as does its etiology .","there is tremendous heterogeneity in sarcoidosis clinical manifestations , severity , and clinical course that vary among different ethnic and racial groups ."
this multicenter study involves a collaborative effort of a genomics informatics center ( gic ) and seven clinical centers .,"as the lung microbiome is likely to have a critical role in the pathobiology of immunologic lung diseases such as sarcoidosis , the national heart , lung , and blood institute solicited applications for the genomic research in alpha - 1 antitrypsin deficiency and sarcoidosis ( grads ) study ."
the purpose of this article is to describe the design of and rationale for the sarcoidosis protocol of the grads study .,this protocol was derived by the sarcoidosis protocol development committee from the initial hypothesis of the gic that distinct patterns in the lung microbiome are characteristic of sarcoidosis phenotypes and are reflected in changes in systemic inflammatory responses as measured by peripheral blood changes in gene transcription .
there is epidemiologic evidence that the scadding stage offers some predictive value in estimating the likelihood of spontaneous remission ( high in scadding stage or i but low in scadding stages iii and iv ) .,"unfortunately , evidence that this staging system or other biomarkers can accurately predict disease course is lacking ."
"chemotactic and proinflammatory effector and regulatory cytokine signals lead to recruitment of additional monocytes and lymphocytes to the lung , macrophage differentiation into epithelioid and multinucleated giant cells , and eventually granuloma formation .","more recently , studies have suggested that th17 effector t - cell responses may contribute to sarcoidosis pathobiology , but whether these responses are critical to disease pathogenesis or play a role in shaping clinical phenotype remains uncertain ."
"grads study investigators have contributed molecular evidence of mycobacterial rna , dna , and proteins in sarcoidosis tissues that are not found in control nonsarcoidosis tissues .",independent molecular and immunologic investigations have suggested the association of pathogenic mycobacteria with some cases of sarcoidosis .
"these studies have confirmed an association with th1 genes and pathways known to be relevant in sarcoidosis , including t - cell receptor pathways ; cell signaling and proliferation ; and cytokine genes , including ifn - g .",grads study investigators evaluating peripheral blood gene eression in sarcoidosis found patterns of gene eression that are associated with disease severity and disease course .
"metagenomics has provided insight into the complex composition of the microbiome of several body sites , and this information has allowed us to draw tentative conclusions about the relationship between specific microbiomes and health .","microbiomic studies may focus on fully enumerating all microbial agents in a body habitat through use of sequence tags that are shared between organisms within a group , such as the s ribosomal rrna gene shared by all bacteria and archaea , or can define all of the genes within a community through "" shotgun "" metagenomic sequencing of all genetic material present ."
"although the healthy lung has traditionally been thought to be sterile , emerging data suggest that the microbial dna present in the healthy lung closely resembles that of the oropharynx , but in markedly lesser amounts , perhaps resulting from microaspiration that occurs even in healthy individuals .",it is likely that there are undetected organisms as well as complex relationships between the multiple pathogens seen in patients with chronic lung diseases .
"the investigators in that study did not find dramatic changes in the lung microbiome , but they examined only seven patients with sarcoidosis .",larger studies that encompass the multiple phenotypes of sarcoidosis are needed to determine the role of the microbiome in this disease .
"however , the current state of knowledge in these areas is rudimentary .","as indicated above , published studies suggest that the lung microbiome and genomic network interactions are likely to play critical roles in disease pathogenesis and determining clinical phenotypes in sarcoidosis ."
"what are the critical interactions between the lung microbiome and host immune response networks that contribute to clinical phenotype and , particularly , clinical outcome ?",among the questions to be addressed are the following : how does the lung microbiome contribute to the phenotypic landscape ?
"not all manifestations could be included , owing to disease heterogeneity and the limited sample size of the study .","the aims of the grads study are to understand how genomic and microbiomic relationships associate with clinical phenotype , so it was necessary to define specific phenotypes important to the study ."
"given the limitations of the study that precluded a lengthy follow - up period sufficient to confidently determine a chronic versus remitting outcome , phenotypes with known outcome eectations were chosen .","second , perhaps the most critical phenotypic distinction of biologic importance is the separation of remitting versus chronic sarcoidosis , the latter being disproportionate in its disease impact ."
there is no similar scope of studies in which chest computed tomography ( ct ) correlates were used for prognostic staging .,"for example , the prognoses associated with the scadding chest radiograph staging system were first used by international convention in the s and were validated in multiple international studies in the subsequent decades ."
"to this end , we settled on five or more organs to meet the criteria for this phenotype , based more on clinical eerience than on any specific data .","although the number of organs that define this phenotype will vary with the instruments and definitions used , our intent was to define a group having a high likelihood of representing chronic sarcoidosis ."
"sampling by bal , bronchial brushing , and oral washing offer the opportunity to compare regional lung microbiome environments in the alveolar compartment with more proximal bronchial wall and oral environments .",high - throughput unbiased analyses of the lung microbiome can potentially identify patterns in the lung microbiome that determine disease activity and persistence as well as response to therapy .
"detailed information on occupational , recreational , environmental , and residential eures is assessed using modifications of the access occupational and environmental questionnaires .","information on personal and medical risk factors , including demographic variables , current and past medical history , reflux history , and current and past medication use , is obtained ."

"eligible participants without a confirmed clinical diagnosis are consented before their clinical bronchoscopy ; if a diagnosis is confirmed by tissue biopsy , the participant is enrolled in the study database and completes testing .",participants are asked to consent to a skin biopsy if cutaneous involvement is deemed consistent with sarcoidosis and a biopsy is planned for clinical purposes .
the participant is then asked to gargle with an antiseptic wash for oral decontamination .,a sample of the working channel of the bronchoscope is also collected to assess preexisting levels of microbial contamination .
"for subjects undergoing a clinical bronchoscopy , a portion of the bal sample is sent for routine clinical tests at the discretion of the bronchoscopist , and the remainder is collected for research purposes .","a portion of the bal fluid is centrifuged to separate it into a cell - free bal fluid supernatant and a bal cell pellet for microbiome , transcriptomic , and biochemical analyses ."
"data are entered at the clinical sites using an encrypted , password protected , web - based system .","clinician - rated data are entered into this system from paper forms , and participant - rated data are entered directly into the system via a tablet computer ."
"in contrast , there are no conserved genes that can be targeted for identification of all viruses ; thus , whole shotgun sequencing of a sample enriched for viruses ( such as by filtering ) can lead to an effective characterization of viral communities .","the nine hypervariable regions of the s rdna can be used for bacterial species identification , with some regions having better discriminatory value than others ."
"by integrating clinical , transcriptomic , and microbiome data , the grads study is positioned to identify novel molecular phenotypes as well as genomic correlates of known clinical phenotypes that will form the basis for molecular fingerprints to predict both disease severity and response to therapy as well as patient stratification for clinical trials .",few studies have incorporated host gene eression and microbiomic data to determine the interactions that occur between host and organisms .
"thus , an overall sample size of participants , with a goal of or subjects per phenotype , is planned to allow for incomplete data collection .","sample size calculations for the analysis of variance are based on prior data showing that a minimum of samples per group is required for detection with power exceeding % for changes of 5 or more , allowing for a single false positive and assuming , 500 genes are truly differentially eressed ."
future studies based on the data foundation provided by the grads study might include the multiple potential avenues of investigation shown in table .,"this information is likely to provide a wealth of information on potential mechanistic pathways and interactions that play critical roles in disease pathogenesis and determine clinical manifestations , clinical course , and response to therapy ."
the grads study researchers spearhead a singular effort to integrate microbiome and genomic analyses with rigorous clinical phenotyping of sufficient scope that should inform and direct future studies on the pathobiology and management of sarcoidosis for the foreseeable future .,"the sarcoidosis protocol is designed to elore how the lung microbiome and peripheral and lung genomes may shape different clinical phenotypes and outcomes in sarcoidosis , a disease with tremendous clinical heterogeneity and uncertain pathobiology and lacking in clinically useful biomarkers ."

its spread throughout eurasia had given rise to concerns in terms of the possible imminence of the next human influenza pandemic .,"in , the avian influenza a subtype h5n1 that caused big outbreaks of fowl pest in mass poultry farming had emerged in hong kong ."
"subtyping is based on two antigenic structures on the surface of the virus ( envelope ) : the haemagglutinin ( h ) shows a spike - like structure , which mediates the virus adsorption to the cell membrane , thus inducing the infection .",in vitro assays demonstrated that this structure can also bind to erythrocytes causing a haemagglutination .
"to date , only h1 , h2 and h3 , respectively , n1 and n2 serologic subtypes have been detected in humans : as phenosubtypes h1n1 ( ' ' spanish ' ' influenza ) , h2n2 ( asiatic influenza ) and h3n2 ( hong kong influenza ) .","if two different influenza a virus subtypes infect the same cell , h and n genes can produce a new combination , which causes a drastic antigenic shift ."
"in particular , if cells of the capillary system are affected , a highly dangerous haemorrhagic infection can be induced .","low pai strains eress h molecules on the envelope , which can be cleaved only by trypsin - like proteases secreted by respiratory or gastrointestinal cells ."
this outbreak proved false the notion that avian influenza viruses need pigs ( or other animals ) as vehicles to be transmitted to humans .,"in this environment , huge numbers of viruses could be produced , which led to the infection of a few humans who fell ill and died ."
"unfortunately , killing the poultry did not stop the viral transmission , because hpai strains of chicken are not necessarily pathogenic for other birds like ducks or geese .","under other circumstances , the chain of infection would disrupt because of rapid host elimination ."
"the following arguments support or decline this fear : ( h1 , h2 , h3 ) have been detected , circulating and re - circulating in humans .","thus , there are epidemiologists , who consider that h2 will cause the next human epidemic ."
"because of epidemiological issues , it is probable that an increase in infectivity of humans will lead to a decrease in pathogenicity and lethality .","molecular investigations on avian and human cases of h5n1 influenza gives evidence why at present this virus is highly pathogenic , but less infectious to human beings ."

the s rdna sequence of strain p11 - 2 3 b has been deposited in genbank ( accession number : kt933136 . 1 ) .,the dna sequence using blast ( nucleotide sequence comparison ) was compared to the genbank database .
"the seed broth ( 5 ml ) was then inoculated into a ml erlenmeyer flask , which contained ml of gause ' s liquid medium .",the flasks were incubated at c on a rotary shaker at rpm for days .
the fermentation broth of isolated strain p11 - 2 3 b ( 50.0 l ) was filtered to harvest pellets and fermentation solution .,the pellets table valinomycin and streptodepsipeptide p11a induced uptake of potassium in membrane of erythrocyte .
"streptodepsipeptide p11a ( 2 , mg ) was hydrolyzed using n lioh ( 1 ml ) in meoh : h o ( 3 : 1 , v / v ) with gentle shaking at room temperature for h . the reaction mixture was neutralized with n hcl to ph e8 and then dried under reduced pressure to give a residue .","hydrolytic products of a ( 1.7 mg , t r min ) , b ( 1.3 mg , t r min ) , and c ( 0.3 mg , t r mi ) were next purified from this residue by hplc using a zorbax sb - c column ( 150 mm , mm ) at conditions of flow rate of ml / min , detection wavelength of nm , and a gradient mobile phase ."
half of each residue was dissolved in h o ( 0.2 ml ) to produce sample a for chiral hplc analysis .,the remaining residue was dissolved in meoh ( 0.2 ml ) to give sample b for gc analysis .
western blot was used to determine the eression levels of metabolic regulators .,"the detailed procedure including protein sample preparation , determination of protein concentration , and western blot analysis was carried out as for yu et al . , ."
the presence of the novel coronavirus ( covid - 19 ) pandemic prompted a structured response across the johns hopkins integrated network of radiation oncology facilities in maryland and the district of columbia .,the department has developed a comprehensive reference document which serves as a resource for our staff and a summary of our response to the pandemic .
"evidence suggests that even for cancers with typically favorable outcomes , there are higher risk subgroups for whom delays may be detrimental , , so the decision rests on an assessment of relative risks for an individual patient .",it should be noted that a delay in instituting radiation treatment should be as short as possible .
please refer to table for disease site specific criteria for level .,patients with highly symptomatic metastatic disease who are deemed by their physician to have a life eectancy of at least - 6 months and those with rapidly progressing potentially curable cancer will be treated .
"these are patients with benign disease or patients amenable to other therapy first ( systemic therapy , surgery , etc . , when appropriate ) .",it may be possible to delay these cases until the pandemic is over or omit radiation all together .
"level patients will receive a video consultation , with intervention delayed until after the pandemic has been cleared if appropriate .",level patients will follow a structure determined by the disease site team leader and may have a delay in the initiation of treatment if needed .
"once a negative result has been obtained , treatment may be resumed .","pui designated as "" level "" may continue treatment and will be managed as covid + until proven otherwise , as described below ."
"given that the duration of contagiousness of patients who have recovered from covid - 19 illness is unknown at this time , patients who resume treatment after a break necessitated by covid - 19 infection will also be treated at the end of the day on a single linac .","no visitors are permitted , with rare exceptions made for caregivers of the severely impaired ."
"because covid + patients will be treated at the end of the day and staff will be following best practices to minimize eure , we have not specifically prohibited staff from rotating to other machines , though this will be avoided when possible .",follow up patient visits should be deferred for at least weeks if feasible .
"cleaning should include but not be limited to countertops , chair armrests , and other non - fabric surfaces .",all examination and treatment spaces as well as common spaces within clinics and waiting rooms should undergo thorough cleaning with approved cleaner solutions at least twice a day .
we used these data to select treatment vaults that were most appropriate for treating covid + / pui .,"for example , in review of data for the east baltimore site , full airflow exchange times for the vaults of our most versatile linear accelerators ranged from to minutes ; thus , we selected the vault with the shortest exchange time for a treating future covid + / pui patient ."
"we recommend that this be performed in the morning of the next business day before the scheduled first patient , in order to minimize eure to facilities staff responsible for the terminal clean .","after treatment of covid + / pui , terminal cleaning procedures must be performed in the machine vault prior to treatment of the general population ."
"based on current information from manufacturers and product suppliers , our abc system ' s single - use mouth piece / tube with attached viromax filter has > 99.99% filtration efficiency for viral particles and is reported to be effective for particles as small as micrometer in size .","currently , we do not have information regarding filtration efficiency for particles < 0.1 micrometer , and it has been noted that covid - 19 particles may vary in size from 6 to 4 micrometers ."
"in addition to this potential uncertainty , abc is felt to be a higher - risk procedure for staff due to possible eure to saliva and respiratory droplets that may be elaborated during abc procedures .","further , it requires increased machine time and coordination between treatment machines when abc systems are shared ."
treatment with free - breathing or abdominal compression approach will be considered for all such patients .,"abc is considered clinically necessary when treatment in free - breathing or with abdominal compression leads to unacceptably high risk for toxicity ( as defined by the treating md ) , and this risk would be substantially lowered with abc ."
abc will be considered clinically necessary and will be used in cooperative patients where abc significantly reduces dose to organs at risk .,as per treatment guidelines for tumor location pediatrics dct will be acquired in patients large enough for tracing to be obtained when there is a concern for susceptibility to motion .
breast abc technique will be used very judiciously and be considered clinically necessary only in cases with cardiac mean dose > 4 gy or lung v20 > 40% when free breathing techniques are used .,"in general , we should seek alternative approaches to abc including imrt / vmat to meet dose objectives ."
"hospitalised children had a higher prevalence of hyaline membrane disease ( hmd ) at birth ( p < 01 , or : ci : 21 to 54 ) and needed more mechanical ventilation ( p < 01 , or : ci : 13 to 96 ) .","( 20.9% ) out of preterm infants required admission for respiratory infection , versus ( 6.9% ) of term infants born in the same period ( p < 001 , or : ci to ) ."
respiratory distress syndrome at birth could be a risk factor for hospitalisation in this group .,"nevertheless , this issue is under investigation and some research groups have not found a higher risk in late preterm infants ( more than weeks of gestational age ( ga ) ."
"preterm infants born between and weeks were followed up by phone , and hospitalisation incidence due to respiratory viral infections was compared with the term babies born during the same period in our hospital .","this was a systematic prospective study conducted at severo ochoa hospital ( leganes , madrid , spain ) to assess the incidence , epidemiology and clinical characteristics of respiratory viral infections that needed hospitalisation in a cohort of moderate and late preterm infants during the first year of life ."
oxygen therapy was provided in order to achieve oxygen saturation %.,"during the hospital stay , and as part of the study , a physician filled out a studyquestionnaire with the following variables : age , sex , clinical diagnosis , history of prematurity and underlying chronic diseases , need for oxygen therapy assessed by transcutaneous oxygen saturation , axillary temperature c , presence of infiltrates / atelectasis in radiographs , administration of antibiotic therapy , duration of hospital stay , total white blood cell ( wbc ) count , c - reactive protein ( crp ) serum values , and result of blood culture if performed ."
"upper respiratory tract infection ( urti ) was defined as the presence of rhinorrhoea and / or cough in the absence of wheezing , dyspnoea , crackling rales or use of bronchodilator , with or without fever .","the classic criteria , presence in an initial episode of acute onset eiratory dyspnoea with previous signs of viral respiratory infection ( whether or not this was associated to respiratory distress or pneumonia ) , were applied in diagnosing bronchiolitis ."
"presence of rsv - a and b types , hmpv , hbov and adenoviruses were investigated by a third multiplex rt - nested pcr method .",an internal amplification control was included in the reaction mixture to exclude false - negative results due to specimen inhibitors and / or extraction failure .
"% of them received treatment with epinephrine , % with salbutamol and % did not receive bronchodilators .",fever was present in % and % showed pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography .
"% of them had a personal history of adaptive respiratory distress ( p < 5 , or ci 38 to 27 ) ( table ) .",% were younger than a month old on admission to intensive care .
there was no difference in mean gestational age at birth ; sex ; weight ; being born by caesarean section ; being twins ; having received antenatal steroids or having suffered adaptive respiratory distress at birth .,the clinical and demographic characteristics of the group of preterm infants who required hospitalisation ( n = ) are shown in table and compared with the other preterm infants ( n = ) .
the physiological deficiencies that result from incomplete lung development are likely to account for the early morbidity and vulnerability to infection .,a modest but growing body of literature has documented the broad range of complications that latepreterm infants may eerience .
clinical characteristics of the episodes in hospitalised infants were similar for preterm and term infants .,"in our eerience , with the limitation of the small number of preterm infants , we did not find any differences in the frequency of picu admission in preterm and term infants ."
"nevertheless , the number of preterm infants in our series is small , and large prospective studies including all the respiratory viruses are necessary to clarify the role of the other viruses in hospitalisations of preterm infants in early infancy .","finally , we think that rhinoviruses are as important as rsv , and special attention must be paid in this group of patients ."
the trial indicates that alpacas may be suitable models for infection and shedding dynamics of this virus .,the alpacas shed virus at challenge but were refractory to further shedding at rechallenge on day .
the role of domestic animals as an intermediate host for humans was initially suggested by case histories of infected patients who had visited farms or tended sick animals shortly before onset of infection .,"( mers - cov ) was first reported in september ; since then , > 1,600 confirmed cases have been reported to the world health organization ( don / 29 - february - 2016 - mers - saudi - arabia / en ) ."
"infection trials in camels have been limited , mainly because of difficulties in housing and handling the animals in a high - containment facility , which is necessary because the virus has a biosafety level classification .","however , the alpaca , a close relative within the camelidae family , may provide a temperamentally suitable and valuable animal model for mers - cov infection , particularly for developing and testing vaccine candidates for camels ."
"we obtained adult female alpacas ( vicugna pacos ) from a commercial supplier in victoria , australia , and housed them in the biosafety level containment facility at the csiro australian animal health laboratory .","before eeriments , the alpacas were allowed to acclimatize for days ; during this time , intrauterine temperature data loggers were implanted according to a previously published procedure ."
we used a camel isolate of mers - cov ( dromedary_ mers - cov_al - hasa_kfu - hku13 / 2013 ; genbank accession nos .,kj650295 - kj650297 ) for infection ; the isolate was prepared in vero cells as described .
gross abnormalities at postmortem examination were found only in alpaca and comprised extensive adhesions of the caudal sac of compartment of the stomach to the umbilicus ; clinical findings in this animal were attributed to this lesion .,"increased temperature was noted in alpaca during days - 20 , but fever ( rectal temperature > 39 c ) was not recorded ."
virus isolation was undertaken with vero cells by using published protocols and was successful for all animals from all types of samples .,virus recovery was successful from oral and superficial nasal swab samples through day ; deep nasal swab samples were positive only through day .
all animals were seronegative by both luminex and vnt before challenge .,antibody was first detected by luminex on day or day in each animal ( table ) ; neutralizing antibody titers were : 20 to : 40 in alpaca from day .
"our trial used a lower challenge dose and a different timeframe for observation ; nevertheless , some preliminary comparative observations may be useful .","in the previous studies , as in ours , the animals were inoculated by the oronasal route , and live virus was detected through day postinfection ."
an underlying assumption in our trial is that the initial infection equates to natural vaccination and that the lack of viral excretion thus follows an induced immune memory response .,"however , our results indicate that this immunologic response is complex ; although a strong serologic response developed in only alpaca , all alpacas were refractory to reinfection ."
future studies should have a larger sample and a longer period of study postinoculation .,"second , our observation period of days before rechallenge is informative but does not provide complete information on duration of protective immunity ."
"taken together , these results demonstrate that replication - incompetent chimeric rvf vlps are an efficient rvfv vaccine candidate .",vaccine efficacy studies were performed in mouse and rat lethal challenge models resulting in high protection rates .
"in ruminants , rvf is characterized by substantial mortality of young animals ( especially of lambs ) , fetal deformities and abortion ( flick and bouloy , ; gerdes , ; swanepoel and coetzer , ) .",rift valley fever virus ( rvfv ) is a devastating mosquito - borne viral zoonotic disease that causes serious morbidity and mortality in both humans and livestock .
"rvfv is a member of the bunyaviridae family , which includes more than viruses grouped into five genera ( orthobunyavirus , hanta - virus , nairovirus , phlebovirus , and tospovirus ) .","bunyaviruses are enveloped viruses with a tripartite , single - stranded rna genome of negative and sometimes ambisense polarity ( elliott , ; elliott et al . , ; schmaljohn and hooper , ) ."
"more recently , rvfv circulated in east africa causing serious epidemics in kenya , tanzania , somalia , sudan and was reported in the comoros islands ( labeaud et al . , ; who , ) in , and subsequently eanded to madagascar and south africa in [ eims / upload / / 242253 / ew_rvf_apr08 . pdf ] .","rvfv has traditionally caused recurrent outbreaks affecting humans and ruminants predominantly in sub - saharan africa , but spread to egypt in and to the arabian peninsula in ( al - hazmi et al . , ; anonymous , ; balkhy and memish , ; madani et al . , ; shoemaker et al . , ) ."
"mp - 12 also has potential veterinary applications ( hunter et al . , ) .","mp12 , a highly attenuated ( by - fluorouracil treatment in cell culture ) human virus isolate of rvfv ( caplen et al . , ; vialat et al . , ) , has recently been tested in a phase ii safety / efficacy clinical trial ( clinicaltrials . gov identifier : nct00415051 ) to determine if it is safe to give to humans ( results not yet published ) ."
"a formalin - inactivated rvfv vaccine , tsi - gsd - 200 , has been developed ; however , it is not licensed and not commercially available ( pittman et al . , ) .","tsi - gsd - 200 is only provided to veterinarians working in endemic areas , high containment laboratory workers and others at high risk for contracting rvfv ( pittman et al . , ) ."
"vlps present viral antigens in a native conformation and are effectively recognized by the immune system ( grgacic , ; grgacic and anderson , ; noad and roy , ) .","especially for viruses classified as high containment agents , e . g . , rvfv and ebolavirus , the development of vlp systems are of practical use because subsequent work can be performed under lower biosafety conditions naslund et al . , ; warfield et al . , ; watanabe et al . , ) ."
high protection rates and robust and long - lasting immune response of vaccinated animals demonstrate that chimeric rvf vlps are a promising approach to generate safe and efficient rvfv vaccines .,vaccine efficacy was analyzed through immunological studies of vaccinated mice and in lethal challenge studies in two different rodent models .
"suboptimal codon usage often leads to the inefficient eression of viral protein genes in mammalian cells ( barrett et al . , ; haas et al . , ; zhou et al . , ) .","we therefore compared the amount of rvf chimvlps generated by - gag cells transfected with eression plasmids encoding either native or codon - optimized ( babcock et al . , ) rvfv g genes ."
results suggest that rvfv g n and momlv gag are located within the same particle in the generated chimvlps ( data not shown ) .,the basis for this approach is that chimvlps are of a different density than vlps based on the different protein composition .
generation of vlp - based vaccine candidates for rvfv from mammalian cells is labor - intensive and costly in regard to both time and reagents .,therefore it is critical to perform the necessary process development to establish efficient manufacturing procedures .
rvf chimvlp generation was measured by western blot analysis using antibodies specific for rvfv g n .,"transfection , purified and concentrated as described above and fractionated by sds - page ."
"interestingly , this analysis also shows that rvf vlps can be generated without inclusion of the n eression plasmid by transfection of rvfv glycoprotein eression plasmids into cells ( fig .",these conditions also resulted in the most detectable rvfv n in the vlp preparations ( data not shown ) .
"however , no significant change in either vlp yields or n content was observed ( data not shown ) .","therefore , an m segment - based minigenome under the control of a rna polymerase i promoter ( billecocq et al . , ) was co - transfected in concert with the rvfv g and n eression plasmids to determine if encapsidation of this minigenome with rvfv n and subsequent packaging into the budding vlps could increase overall n content ."
"we first analyzed the immune response in mice ( neutralizing antibody titers , durability and cytokine eression levels ) induced by rvf vlps and subsequently performed protection studies in two different rodent models .",we next addressed the question of whether the generated rvf vlps can be used as a replication - incompetent vaccine candidate .
such high neutralizing titers observed more than months post - vaccination indicates a durable rvfv vaccine candidate and warrants further evaluation of these rvf vlp - based vaccine candidates .,no seroconversion was detected in a control group vaccinated with an unrelated momlv - based vaccine ( ebolavirus gp - pseudotyped momlv ; control ) or non - vaccinated mice ( control ) .
"next , we studied antigen - specific secretion of select cytokines by splenocytes isolated from vaccinated mice to determine whether rvf vlp - based vaccines elicit both humoral and cellular immunity .","these responses have been correlated with vaccine efficacy in live challenge models ( wack et al . , ) ."
"significance was determined using the mantel - cox test , and significant differences exist between groups including chimvlp and vlp - n ( p = 01 ) , vlp + n and vlp - n ( p = 196 ) , all three vaccinated groups and controls and ( p = 001 ( chimvlp ) , p = 001 ( vlp + n ) and p = 007 ( vlp - n ) .",there is no significant difference between the chimvlp and vlp + n groups ( p = 93 ) .
"rats present another important alternative animal model for rvfv disease and are often considered more relevant than mice ( anderson and anderson et al . , b ; bird , albarino , and nichol , ) .","therefore , after promising data were obtained in the mouse model , rvf vlp - based vaccine efficacy ( survival ) was next analyzed in a lethal rat challenge model ."
additional eeriments to determine minimum vaccine dose and vaccination schedule as well as safety and efficacy studies in non - human primates are required to further evaluate this promising vaccine platform .,"overall , immunological as well as lethal challenge studies in two different rodent models clearly demonstrate that rvf vlp - based vaccines are a promising concept for the development of a vaccine for use in humans and livestock ."
"this is further enhanced by the particulate nature of vlps that appears to be optimal for uptake by dendritic cells ( fifis et al . , ) .","in addition , they are safer than inactivated and attenuated virus vaccines because they are usually free of viral genetic material and therefore are not encumbered by the possible safety - related drawbacks including reversion , recombination and re - assortment ."
"in addition to their ability to stimulate b - cell - mediated immune responses , vlps have been shown to be highly effective at stimulating cd4 proliferative and cytotoxic t lymphocyte responses ( murata et al . , ; paliard et al . , ; schirmbeck et al . , ) .","mimicking the structure of virus particles allows the use of lower doses of antigen to elicit a similar protective response when compared to subunit vaccines ( noad and roy , ) ."
"several vlp - based vaccines are in human clinical trials or are fdaapproved , including those for hepatitis b virus ( andre and safary , ; mcaleer et al . , ; sitrin et al . , ) , trivalent influenza h1n1 , h3n2 and b vaccine ( "" flublok "" ) ( cox et al . , ; treanor et al . , ) , h5n1 "" bird flu "" ( perrone et al . , ) , human papillomavirus giannini et al . , ; harper et al . , ; harro et al . , ; joura et al . , ) , human immunodeficiency virus ( young et al . , ) and norwalk virus ( tacket et al . , ) .","other vlp - based vaccines with very promising pre - clinical results include vlps for the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) coronavirus ( lokugamage et al . , ) , human polyomavirus ( goldmann et al . , ) , rotavirus ( ciarlet et al . , ; el - attar et al . , ; jiang et al . , ) , and ebola and marburg viruses ( swenson et al . , ; swenson et al . , ; warfield et al . , ; warfield et al . , b ; warfield et al . , ) ."
"the generation of rvf vlps lacking the n protein facilitates the rational vaccine design for the generation of a safe and highly efficient rvfv vaccine following the diva ( differentiating infected from vaccinated animals ) concept to differentiate vaccinated from infected individuals ( see bird et al . , ; capua et al . , ) .","because rvfvspecific antibodies against the n proteins are easily detected in infected individuals , a vaccine candidate lacking the n antigens facilitates diva ."
"unfortunately , the generation of rvf chimvlps is more complicated because rvfv g and momlv gag localize to the golgi ( gerrard and nichol , ; schmaljohn and hooper , ; wasmoen et al . , ) and plasma membranes ( soneoka et al . , ) , respectively , in mammalian cells .","however , over - eression of rvfv g leads to some g n / g c localization at the cell surface ( filone et al . , ; gerrard and nichol , ; gerrard and nichol , ; liu et al . , ) , which allows the generation of rvf chimvlps ."
this gene was cloned into pcaggs eression vector via the ecori / xhoi restriction endonu - clease sites .,"the plasmid preparations used for transfections was prepared ( 0.5 mg / ml , nucleobond column - purified ( machery - nagel ) by the nature technology corporation ( lincoln , ne , usa ) ."
"this generates a product with a kozak sequence ( kozak , a ; kozak , b ; kozak , ; kozak , ) immediately to the start codon and and kpni and xhoi restriction sites , respectively .",this product was cloned into pcaggs eression vector via kpni / xhoi restriction endonuclease sites .
"purification of rvf chimvlps was performed by centrifugation of concentrated vlp preparations through a % sucrose cushion in pbs using beckman ultraclear ultracentrifuge tubes in a sw28 rotor at , 000 rpm at c for h with a beckman l - 80 ultracentrifuge .",samples were then resuspended in ml of sterile % nacl ( baxter ) .

"sera were diluted : 10 in maintenance medium ( dmem , % fbs , % pen / strep ) and titrated in two - fold serial dilution steps .","equal volumes ( 60 l ) of rvfv zh501 dilution containing approximately plaque - forming units ( pfu ) / 100 l , and serum dilutions were mixed and incubated for h at c and % co ."
"cytokines in cell culture supernatant were analyzed by a bead - based multiplex system ( bioplex , biorad ) according to manufacturer ' s instructions .","supernatants were harvested for analysis at , , and h post - stimulation ."
all animal eeriments were approved by iowa state university and the university of texas medical branch iacuc committees .,rats were monitored daily for weight change and signs of disease .
nasopharyngeal secretions obtained from this infant also revealed rsv type b infection and we decided to screen the remaining infants for rsv .,"although patients with rsv were cared for in separate isolation rooms , another preterm infant who had recovered from respiratory distress syndrome developed further respiratory distress after a week ."
this recommendation is similar to the one reported by the spanish neonatal society which suggests palivizumab prophylaxis for preterm infants and newborns with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease when such outbreaks occur .,"after a few small rsv nicu outbreaks in turkey , the turkish neonatal society now recommends rsv prophylaxis for premature infants in the nicu who are already candidates for the prophylaxis programme as outpatients when at least three rsv - positive patients are present in the nicu ."
"biofilms are clearly not the only reason for failures in hospital disinfection , given the difficulty in achieving adequate distribution and contact time using manual methods , but these findings may have implications for infection control practices within hospitals and on the choice of the appropriate disinfectants for hospital surfaces .",this is particularly relevant because bacterial cells in aqueous planktonic phase remain the most common model for many microbiological studies including disinfectant testing .
"due to emerging diseases , increasing resistances , international travelling , and the risk of bioterroristic attacks , infectious diseases concern the whole world and can only be combated by internationally coordinated and interdisciplinary approaches .",infectious diseases represent a continuous and increasing threat to human health and welfare .
"despite the availability of antibiotics and vaccines against many of the causative pathogens , the mortality rates remain high .","according to estimations of the who , infectious diseases caused million deaths each in , accounting for % of the total global mortality ."
"as indicated by the appearance and dissemination of the human immunodeficiency virus and the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) ( krilov , ) , infectious diseases concern the whole world and can only be solved by internationally coordinated and interdisciplinary approaches .","infectious diseases are not only a problem of certain areas in the world , although developing countries are carrying the major part of the burden ."
what contributions to infectious disease research are considered most important ?,do they rely on scientific quality only or do they also consider efforts to bridge the gap between research and application ?
"once developing countries start to be among those who are highly active in the area of infectious disease research , chances are better that they will in fact participate fully in shaping the research agenda .","as our analysis shows , brazil and india are among the top countries when taking the last years into account ."
"worldwide high priority has also been given to respiratory diseases , tuberculosis , and hepatitis c . this group of diseases is followed by sepsis , hepatitis b , diarrhoea , and malaria .","it is notable to see that although diarrhoea and malaria represent the third and fifth most frequent causes of death worldwide they only rank on positions and , respectively , in the research priorities ."
"unfortunately , a decrease in worldwide publication activities was determined for aids , diarrhoea , pertussis , tetanus , meningitis , syphilis , schistoso - miasis , leprosy , and diphtheria .","based on our data , publications on respiratory infections , tuberculosis , malaria , hepatitis b and c , sepsis , dengue fever , chagas ' disease , japanese encephalitis , and chlamydial infections increased over the last years ."
this fact is also reflected by the worldwide publication activities on drug resistance which more than doubled over the last years .,"the emergence of microbes resistant to antibiotics is considered to be a most serious threat to humanity ( hacker and klenk , ) ."
"for instance , the fact that diarrhoeal diseases are among the three most severe health problems is not clearly reflected in worldwide publication activities .","the top five countries with most publication activities on infectious diseases each seem to focus on diseases that are relevant within their own borders , like hepatitis b and c , sepsis , and hiv / aids ."
"in order to facilitate the interpretation of the statistical data and add some qualitative aspects to the quantitative analyses , we addressed senior scientists in the field of infectious diseases in autumn and sought their written opinion on the perception of infectious disease research and strategies that should be undertaken in the future .","as a result , the input of eerienced group leaders ( 28% from germany , % each from india , switzerland , uk , and usa , - 4% from other countries in the world ) could be included into this work ."
' ' interdisciplinarity ' ' and ' ' impact on policy ' ' were chosen by less then %.,"' ' applicability of the results to the field / clinical work ' ' was ranked third , having been chosen by about one - third of the scientists as one of the three most reliable criteria for evaluating a research group ."
"apart from the results of our study and political as well as economic strategies , a number of central strategies for efficient control of infectious diseases have to be followed in the future .","as concluded at the international symposium ' ' threat of infection ' ' , conducted in wu rzburg , germany , in july ( hacker and klenk , ) , these include ( i ) maintainance of vaccination programs and development of novel vaccines , ( ii ) preservation of the know - how concerning pathogens and diseases which are considered to be in the post - eradication era ( like smallpo in order to be prepared for reappearance of the pathogens and potential bioterroristic attacks , ( iii ) guaranteed provision of vaccines and drugs for emergencies , ( iv ) prevention of misuse of know - how , methods , and drugs by increasing national and international security measures , ( v ) enhanced interdisciplinary research activities including genome and proteome analyses , characterization of known and novel pathogens , studies on mechanisms of transmission , pathogenicity , and resistance as well as drug development including all required preclinical and clinical steps ."
"a concerning the use and misuse of impact factors in evaluating research , see e . g .","seglen , . contributions were quoted repeatedly : john franklin enders - isolation of the poliovirus , alphonse laverandiscovery of the human malaria parasite , kary banks mullis - development of pcr , pierre paul mile rouevelopment of the diphtheria vaccine , jonas salkpoliomyelitis vaccination , james watson and francis crick - discovery of dna , and the conduction of genome projects by different authors ."
"however , to tackle the global challenge that infectious diseases confront us with today , we need answers that go beyond the identification of micro - organisms and therapeutic or preventive principles that pasteur , fleming , jenner , koch , ehrlich , ross , and von behring provided us with .","beyond these fundamental and important discoveries we need contextual knowledge about socioeconomic , political and cultural factors in order to tailor treatment and prevention programs that will work ."
"studies , among them robert koch ' s and paul ehrlich ' s eeriments with salvarsan and other chemicals , were criticized for insufficient informed consent of study participants and for using vulnerable populations , like people living in ' ' the colonies ' ' , prisoners , children , or prostitutes ( reuland , ; roelcke and maio , ) .","the guidelines of the german reich ' s ministry of the interior of reacted to the increasingly intense political debate by specifically emphasizing the necessity of elicit informed consent und the moral inadequacy of eloiting a person ' s difficult social situation for performing studies that pose a risk to the participant ' s health ( steinmann , ) ."
"however , concerning research priorities , the scientific community should focus on the most prominent diseases affecting large parts of the world ' s population like diarrhoeal diseases and malaria , but also on neglected diseases like schistosomiasis and trypanosomiasis .",taking into account that national research activities are of course driven by national funding this is a difficult task .
in order to actually tackle the global challenge of infectious diseases we need to find the best and most efficient ways to transfer knowledge from the labs to the field .,"as developing countries are the ones for whom the burden of disease is greatest , their participation in the definition of research goals and the ronald ross link between mosquitoes and malaria"
"for example the european & developing countries clinical trials partnership , ) .","we will have to make sure , however , that blind enthusiasm or conflicts of interest do not compromise the ethical dimension of an urgently needed global effort to reduce mortality and burden of infectious diseases ."
a b s t r a c t an sis network model incorporating the influence of media coverage on transmission rate is formulated and analyzed .,we calculate the basic reproduction number r by utilizing the local stability of the disease - free equilibrium .
"indeed , media coverage is a key factor in the transmission process of infectious disease .","for example , a survey found that three tabloids and two broadsheets ran a total of news stories involving severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) in britain from march to july , while the new zealand herald ran articles from march to june during the spread of sars ."
"there are extensive investigations on overcoming this shortcoming , and one important effort along this direction is the use of complex network models , since the spread mechanism of diseases on networks has been widely studied by many researchers .","researchers have given different interpretations for the mechanism of the propagation of diseases on complex networks [ 16 , ."
"in particular , media coverage has a great impact on individual behavior towards the disease , and further affects the government health care interventions to control the spread of such disease .","it is media coverage that may provide people with more information about the disease to take precautions such as distancing , wearing protective masks , vaccinations , to reduce the chances of being infected ."
the value k = k kp ( k ) is the average number of contacts each node ( individual ) can make .,"in epidemiology , there are two important and fundamental epidemic models : sis and sir ."
"in addition , we use another parameter m to reflect the density level of media coverage on the disease even though there is no infectious case in the region under consideration .","this can be elained as follows : due to the increasing trend of globalization and the development of information technology , information about infectious cases found in one region may spread rapidly to another region without this disease through media coverage , for example , in the case of the media coverage of the outbreak of sars in ."
"since the first equation of system is independent of the second , according to the results obtained by d ' onofrio et al .",", one obtains that the disease - free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if r , i . e . , lim t + i k ( t ) = , k = , , ."
"to clarify this , the sensitivity analysis of r in terms of the model parameters will be performed in section .","in order to eradicate the disease , what we need to do is to reduce the basic reproduction number r below ."
"the full connectivity distribution of the ba scale - free network is embedded with p ( k ) = m k , where m is the minimum number of links at each node .","to perform an elicit calculation for the barabasi - albert ( ba ) scale - free model , we use the continuous k approximation that allows the practical substitution of sum series with integrals ."
"in this section , we will perform a series of numerical simulations to give more insight into the dynamical process on ba random scale - free networks ( p ( k ) = m k , m = ) .","first , we perform a sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number r in terms of the model parameters ."
"the influence of parameter ( depletion rate of media coverage ) on the basic reproduction number r is greater than that of parameters a and / , which shows that we should improve the effectiveness of the campaigning ( i . e .",", we can see that the basic reproduction number r increases with increasing the model parameters a , , and / , while it decreases with increasing the parameter m ."
we derive the basic reproduction number r by investigating the local stability of the disease - free equilibrium e and perform a series of numerical simulations to gain more insight into the dynamical process .,"different from the classical network - based sis models , which only consider contacts between susceptible and infectious individuals , the impact of media coverage on the reduction of the transmission rate is also taken into account ."
"however , there are some limitations of our model : ( i ) we use mean - field theory to describe the interactions between the susceptibles and infected individuals without elicitly considering the network topology such as assortative or disassortative , clustering ; ( ii ) we use a maximum degree n such that the ode approximation has the same dynamics as the stochastic process if n / n is large .","we emphasize that this preliminary work does not consider the factors of edges rewiring , but only focuses on the case in which the media coverage reduces the transmission rate between susceptible and infected individuals ."
there were no changes in respiration rate or lying time before clinical signs of disease appeared .,"however , the number of lying bouts decreased and lying bout duration increased before and following clinical signs of disease ."
"typically affecting calves during the first d of life ( cho and yoon , ) , ncd causes severe diarrhea , resulting in dehydration , weight loss , and potentially death ( schroeder et al . , ) .","neonatal calf diarrhea ( ncd ) , an enteric disease affecting beef and dairy industries worldwide , is a significant concern from both economic and animal welfare perspectives ."
"therefore , systems need to be developed that would enable disease to be detected earlier than is currently possible based on when an animal presents overt clinical signs of disease .","the challenge with ncd is that by the time a calf exhibits clinical signs ( e . g . , diarrhea and dehydration ) , much of the internal damage to the intestines has already occurred ."
"therefore , there is a need to develop measures that could be incorporated within automated systems on - farm to enable remote and reliable monitoring of animal health and welfare .","additionally , increasing herd sizes leads to less individual animal contact and , with fewer eerienced stock people in the industry , can lead to an increase in the number of cases of ncd going undiagnosed ; this results in reduced welfare and production and increased mortalities ."
infrared thermography ( irt ) is a noninvasive method of detecting radiated heat .,"previous studies have investigated the use of irt for detecting early signs of bovine respiratory disease ( brd ) and bovine viral diarrhea ( bvd ; schaefer et al . , schaefer et al . , , schaefer et al . , , ."
"water intake , drinking behavior , and respiration rate ( rr ) also have the potential to be used as early indicators of disease .","however , current methods for measuring these responses are often labor intensive and are not always suitable for monitoring individual animals ."
the purpose of our study was to identify physiological and behavioral responses associated with the early onset of ncd in calves infected with rotavirus and to assess the suitability of those responses as indicators for early disease detection .,"in addition , by assessing the thermal responses of different anatomical regions in response to disease , we investigated the suitability of irt as a noninvasive method for early disease detection ."
"within a single barn , calves were housed in of equal - sized ( 6.6 m ) pens constructed on a solid concrete base with solid walls on all sides .","within each pen , an area ( 30 m ) of wood chip ( 20 cm deep ) was provided as bedding ."
control and infected animals were housed separately using the pens but were otherwise handled in the same manner .,calves in treatment group were infected with rotavirus through an oral drench containing a mixture of ml of water and ml of feces collected from calves known to be positive for rotavirus .
health checks were also used to monitor signs of nasal and ocular discharge and navel infection ( a disease resulting from bacterial infection via the umbilical cord soon after birth ) .,"rectal temperatures were taken once per animal during each health check using a digital thermometer ( mc - 343 ; omron , kyoto , japan ) ."
"the presence of cryptosporidium was assessed by performing an acid - fast stain analysis , which caused oocysts to stain from light pink to red .",broth enrichment and selective plating were used to assess fecal samples for the presence of salmonella .
"there was no set minimum amount that had to be consumed ; any visit in which the calf consumed milk , regardless of the amount , was regarded as a rewarded visit .",an unrewarded visit was one in which the calf visited the feeder but did not receive an allocation of milk and hence no amount of milk was consumed .
"for the eye , this circle was placed so it included the eyeball and area surrounding the eyelid .",this analysis involved tracing a circle over the area of interest as shown in figure .
"the output was converted into daily summaries of standing and lying behavior using sas software ( version ; sas institute inc . , cary , nc ) .",data loggers were initialized and downloaded using onset hoboware pro software ( version ; onset computer corp . ) .
video footage was analyzed continuously for each animal to record the frequency and duration of visits to the trough .,"a drinking behavior was defined as "" calf ' s head is over the water trough . """
"the level of intraobserver reliability was calculated in excel ( version 0 , microsoft corp . ) using the correlation function .","initial observations were compared with secondary observations , revealing that intraobserver reliability ranged from to % with a combined overall average of %."
"in addition , some calves in the control group also contracted rotavirus (8 of control animals contracted rotavirus ) .",the effectiveness of the rotavirus infection treatment was limited because not all calves infected with rotavirus contracted the virus ( only of treated animals became infected ) .
"compared with drinking rate and milk consumption , svensson and jensen suggested that the number of unrewarded visits was the most useful indicator of disease .",age and breed could be factors contributing to the differences in feeding behaviors across the studies .
"in the current study , changes in irt of < 0.3 c before clinical signs appeared were found to be significant ( p < 01 ) .","collected images from various anatomical locations ( side , back , eye , ear , and nose ) and found that irt temperatures of these areas increased by to c before clinical signs of bvd and that changes of < 1 c were clinically significant ."
"however , other studies ( montanholi et al . , ( montanholi et al . , , found that temperatures of the snout , cheek , and hoof were more suitable indicators of feeding efficiency .","compared with core body areas , a consistent finding across all studies ( montanholi et al . , ( montanholi et al . , , martello et al . , ) was that temperature differences measured at the extremities were the most useful indicators of feeding efficiency ."
"although water intake was not measured in the current study , this increase in visit duration may suggest an increase in the amount of water being consumed during each visit .","in terms of drinking behavior , the only significant change observed in the current study was an increase in visit duration before clinical signs of disease appeared ."
"respiration rate decreased only following clinical signs of disease , suggesting that it may not be a suitable early indicator for disease detection .","the lack of change in rr before clinical signs were evident could be due to ncd being a gastrointestinal disease as opposed to a respiratory disease such as brd , where rr would be eected to change more rapidly ."
"milk consumption , irt temperatures of the side and shoulder , number and duration of lying bouts , and duration of drinking visits all showed changes before the clinical identification of disease , therefore demonstrating potential suitability as early indicators of ncd .",the integration of these measures into an automated on - farm system could enable earlier treatment and isolation of diseased animals to prevent further spread of disease by alerting farmers to diseased animals earlier than is currently possible based on overt clinical signs .
f gene is the most conserved among different lineages and efforts are underway to design recombination vaccine using f gene .,the virus has been seen in all countries with seasonal distribution in winter months for temperate and spring / summer for tropical countries .
acute respiratory tract infections ( ari ) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide ( denny and loda ; hijazi et al ) .,"of the million deaths of children less than years of age throughout the world million children died from acute lower respiratory tract infections ( alri ) in the year , % of them in sub - sahara africa and south asia ( williams et al ) ."
"all classes of micro organisms including viruses , bacteria and protozoa are capable of infecting the respiratory tract , but viruses and bacteria are the common pathogens .","a variety of viruses , including , respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) , infl uenza viruses , parainfl uenza viruses , adenoviruses , coronaviruses and picornaviruses , are associated with different respiratory syndromes in all age groups ( grondahl et al ; weigl et al ) ."
it was fi rst reported in from the netherlands from nasopharyngeal aspirates ( taken over a year period ) in hospitalized children and infants with ari having signs and symptoms similar to that of rsv infection ( van den hoogen et al ) .,metapneumovirus is a recently discovered etiological agent of acute respiratory illness ( ari ) .
genetic analysis of the virus showed that it is an rna virus of the paramyviridae family and pneumovirinae subfamily along with rsv .,"the avian pneumoviruses ( apv ) ( formerly turkey rhinotracheitis virus ) is highly related to hmpv and these two viruses have been separated by tanomists into a separate genus , metapneumovirus ( lamb et al ) ."
the rna genome associates with viral proteins to form the helical nucleocapsid ( represented on the right and in the centre of the virion on the left in fi gure ) .,"the virion is surrounded by a lipid envelope derived from the plasma membrane of the host cell into which the three virus glycoproteins , the attachment ( g ) , fusion ( f ) , and small hydrophobic ( sh ) proteins , are inserted ( collins and mottet ) ."
the m2 - 1 transcriptional enhancer protein is also thought to be associated with the nucleocapsid .,"the nucleocapsid is surrounded by the matrix ( m ) protein , which forms a link between the nucleocapsid and the lipid membrane of the virus particle ( easton et al ) ."
"the hmpv genome is predicted to encode proteins in the order - n - pm - f - m2 - sh - g - l - 5 ( the m2 gene is predicted to encode proteins , m2 - 1 and m2 - 2 , using overlapping open reading frames , as in rsv ) ( van den hoogan et al ) ( fi gure ) .","the genome also contains noncoding ' leader which has the viral promoter , ' trailer and intergenic regions , consistent with the organization of rsv ."
"although the function of each of the gene products has not been formally tested , it is likely that the function of the proteins can be predicted by comparison with other paramyviruses .","the f ( fusion ) , g ( glycosylated ) and sh ( short hydrophobic ) proteins are integral membrane proteins on the surface of infected cells and virion particles ."
the function of the sh proteins of both the viruses remains unknown .,"the n ( nucleoprotein ) , p ( phosphoprotein ) and l ( large , polymerase ) proteins are replication proteins in the nucleocapsid , the m2 - 1 and m2 - 2 proteins are regulatory proteins and the m ( matri protein may coordinate viral assembly of viral nucleocapsids with envelope proteins ( crowe ) ."
"full length sequences of genomes from viruses representing the major subgroups show that the diversity between hmpv subgroup a and b sequences is greatest for the sh and g proteins ( 59 and % identity , respectively ) , biacchesi et al ; and is more than rsv subgroup a and b . hmpv f protein , which is predicted to be the principal target of protective antibodies , is more conserved in hmpv strains than rsv .","the overall level of genome nucleotide sequence identity and aggregate proteome amino acid sequence identity between the two hmpv subgroups were and %, respectively , similar to the respective values for rsv a and b groups ( hamelin et al ) ."
"previously reported a2 lineage is found to consist of two clusters namely , a2a and a2b .",among all the sub - lineages of hmpv the a2 sub - lineage shows the greatest diversity ( huck et al ) .
"the genetic diversity in hmpv strains also affects antigenic diversity , but to what extent has not been resolved .",studies with eerimental infection of animals have suggested that the two lineages exhibited % antigenic relatedness based on reciprocal cross - neutralization assay with post - infection hamster sera ( skiadopoulos et al ) .
"a study conducted at vanderbilt university medical center on the association of the virus in a cohort of subjects of age - 5 years , followed during a - year period revealed that hmpv was associated with common cold ( complicated by otitis media in one third ) , bronchiolitis , pneumonia , croup and exacerbation of reactive airway disease ( williams et al ) . the clinical profi le of illness caused by hmpv was similar to that caused by rsv .","in outpatients with alri , hmpv was detected in % of cases , which was second only to rsv ( williams et al ) ."
in fragile elderly hmpv causes more severe disease than in healthy elderly or young adults ( falsey et al ) .,in adults it usually causes fl u like illness and colds .
acute wheezing and asthma exacerbations have been associated with hmpv infection in some studies ( jartti et al ; peiris et al ) but all studies have not shown this association ( rawlinson et al ) .,respiratory virus infections are often associated with recurrent wheezing in children and exacerbations of asthma in older patients .
the possible synergistic interaction between hmpv and the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) coronavirus has been recently postulated during the sars outbreak in canada and hong kong as many individuals were found to have co - infection with hmpv ( chan and li ; poutanen et al ) .,"on the other hand , such synergy between hmpv and sars was not confi rmed in eerimental macaque models ."
"however , it should be emphasized that there is no cross - protection among the virus strains .","a recent report has described a child who suffered from two episodes of hmpv infection during a one month period , each caused by a different strain ( vargas et al ) ."
"for the f protein to become functional , it has to be cleaved by cellular proteases , and the hydrophobic amino terminal region of the f1 component then promotes the fusion process , which introduces the internal components of the virion into the cytoplasm of the host cell , where the remainder of the infectious cycle takes place .","following g - protein - mediated attachment , the f glycoprotein promotes ph - independent fusion between the cell membrane and the virus envelope ."
in a preliminary study from pune in india hpmv was found in of children with ari ( rao et al ) .,in a study of children seen in a large referral hospital in delhi hmpv was detected in % of ari cases by reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) ( banerjee et al ) .
"it is interesting to note that detection rates of hmpv have generally been higher in retrospective studies than in prospective studies , an observation consistent with a degree of selection bias .",this indicates that large prospective studies are needed in order to clarify the role of hmpv in various clinical conditions ( hamelin et al ) .
the peak of activity of hmpv at any given location often coincides with or follows the peak of rsv activity esper et al ) .,the activity of hmpv in temperate climates peaks between december and february ( maggi et al ; van den hoogen et al ) where as in subtropics it peaks in springsummer .
"for example , the prototype strain identifi ed in the netherlands is genetically similar to strains identifi ed in australia ; new haven , connecticut and quebec , canada in different years ( esper et al ) .",we in delhi also found that lineages of hmpv circulated during the same season i . e .
"although formal transmissions studied have not been carried out , transmission most likely is through large particle respiratory secretions and fomites as is true for rsv ( human metapneumovirus ) .",nosocomial transmission has been reported in hospital setting ( pieris et al ) .
"by the age of years , > 90% of individuals screened have evidence of hmpv infection .",presence of hmpv antibodies in serum samples obtained in showed that the virus has been circulating for at least for the past years in the netherlands ( van den hoogen et al ) .
many strains show reliable cytopathic effect ( cpe ) in tertiary monkey kidney cell line / llcmk - 2 cells .,hmpv replicates poorly in conventional cell culture and is relatively diffi cult to isolate .
in addition shell vial culture for rapid isolation of hmpv has also been described ( reina et al ) .,many laboratories are now using this cell line for routine virus isolation .
direct immunofl uorescence assay ( dfa ) using virus specifi c antibodies is a rapid method to detect respiratory viruses and is commonly used in diagnostic laboratories .,"commercially available hmpv specifi c antibodies have been developed for direct immunofl uorescence assays , though this method may not be as sensitive as rt - pcr for the detection of hmpv ( ebihara et al , landry et al , percivalle et al ."
because of the unavailability of rapid antigenic detection assays in the past and slow growth in tissue culture molecular methods have become the method of choice for the diagnosis of hmpv infection .,cote et al reported that primers that bind regions of the n and l genes are highly sensitive for the detection of hmpv strains of both genotypes .
nucleic acid sequence based amplifi cation assay ( nasba ) targeting the m gene has also been developed for detection of hmpv infection in respiratory specimens ( dare et al ) .,"the assay has been developed to detect the n gene of all known hmpv lineages ( maertzdorf et al ) and real time rt - pcr targeting the n and / or l gene is more sensitive , specifi c , and rapid method to detect this virus in clinical samples than conventional rt - pcr ( mackay et al ) ."
enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) can also be used for hmpv serological testing using the hmpv - infected cells ( falsey et al .,"recently , elisa methods using viral n or f protein eressed in prokaryotic or recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus ( vsv ) ( leung et al ) and recombinant baculovirus system ( liu et al ) have been developed to detect antibodies against hmpv ."
"chimeric hmpv / avian pneumovirus recombinant viruses in which the n or p gene of hmpv was replaced with the corresponding gene from avian pneumovirus are attenuated in african green monkeys ( the p gene chimera is - to , 000 - fold more attenuated than the n chimera ) , though both are as immunogenic as wild - type hmpv ( pham et al ) .",this represents another strategy for the development of recombinant attenuated live hmpv vaccines .
the progress towards an effective antiviral strategy for hmpv is currently limited by the scant data on pathogenesis of the virus in the natural host .,it is likely that an hmpv - neutralizing monoclonal antibody for prophylaxis of high - risk infants ( similar to the anti - rsv f humanized monoclonal antibody currently used for prevention of severe rsv disease ) will be developed and tested .
the virus is associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract infections and may be a trigger for asthma .,"there are two major genotypes of hmpv , whether these genotypes represent distinct serotypes re - mains controversial ."
eerience with the anthrax attack and the h1n1 pandemic suggest that there is limited willingness to accept such drugs and that minority groups may respond differently from others .,"we conducted intercept interviews in the metropolitan washington , dc , area , examining hypothetical scenarios : a new respiratory virus and public eure to high levels of radiation ."
this establishes trust in a message source and the credibility of a message .,"successful communication begins with accurate information delivered in a timely , empathetic , and open way ."
"those efforts have included policy changes that enable the food and drug administration ( fda ) to quickly evaluate and authorize such medical countermeasures in a declared public health emergency and to communicate this approval , along with partner public health agencies like the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) .","however , there is relatively little literature that elores public perceptions about such medical countermeasures and the mechanism through which they would be distributed ."
", ongoing research is developing medical countermeasures deployable in public health emergencies , enabling the best emergency medicines and tools to be available when disaster strikes .","according to the fda , about different euas were in use to address public health emergencies at the time the study was conducted : zika virus , enterovirus d68 , ebola virus , h7n9 influenza , middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus , and anthrax ."
"in a nationwide harris poll of , 232 us adults surveyed between january and , , % understood the fda ' s roles and responsibilities .","as a foundation for these actions , the fda has reasonably good credibility with the us public ."
"there was greater willingness to accept tamiflu , which was an approved drug authorized under eua for unapproved uses , with % indicating willingness to take the drug .","in both cases , african americans were least likely to accept the medical countermeasure ."
"based on previous research , trust , uncertainty , and risk perception are critical determinants of public reactions in emergencies .",we describe these determinants and elore what we currently know about their impact on the public .
"most important , the willingness of a member of the public to engage in preventive or emergency behaviors depends on the risk communicator ' s preexisting organizational reputation , people ' s past and present relationship eerience with the communicating organization , and the credibility of the organization ' s advice .","the more that people trust their government or the communicating official , the better they are able to handle fear in uncertain situations ."
"additionally , by directly addressing uncertainty early in a crisis , the government may be able to influence the public ' s acceptance of future changes in understanding and behavioral recommendations .","to mitigate this uncertainty about conflicting government guidance , having an open forum can foster trust and enhance people ' s abilities to make informed decisions , ultimately reducing uncertainty ."
"in addition to trust in institutions and uncertainty , they identified additional outrage factors : controllability , voluntariness , dread , effects on children , media attention , benefits , familiarity , catastrophic potential , human versus natural origin , understanding , and reversibility , among others - all of which can affect how we perceive risk .","covello and colleagues described outrage factors , which relate to public reactions to the risk , rather than the technical aspects of a given risk ."
"recognizing the lack of familiarity and the novelty of a threat during an emergency , and the complex terminology used by the fda and the cdc , our first research question is : to what extent are there differences across us racial / ethnic groups and their subpopulations in their understanding of medical countermeasure messages , including fda regulatory terms relevant to medical countermeasures used in public health emergencies ( eg , ind , shelf life , eua , adjuvants , compassionate use , animal rule , stages of drug or vaccine development ) ?","this study provides a critical look at these foundational determinants and the public understanding of medical countermeasures in hypothetical scenarios , described in detail below ."
"the team selected metro stops that were located in diverse areas of the washington , dc , region or that served as hubs connecting multiple metro lines .",central intercept interviews are ideal for understanding how people immediately process and react to information and why .
"the face - to - face interviews generally lasted to minutes , with interviewers transcribing all comments from subjects by hand , verbatim .",interviews were not recorded because of the sensitivity of the topic and the high level of background noise in the interview locations .
interviewers were sent to locations based on us census data indicating racial and ethnic clusters in close proximity to the businesses and metro stations used .,"the interview began with a brief verbal consent form elaining the study purpose and the compensation for participants ' time , followed by general screening questions ."
"when participants were ready , interviewers asked a series of openended and closed - ended questions about the documents .",page showed a facebook post from the fda with a color graphic about the hazard ; page gave a brief scenario describing eure to the hazard ; and the final page was a mock - up of an fda fact sheet about the treatment .
the research team developed the interview instrument from literature and previous eerience .,"demographic * the remaining subjects either provided too little or suspect data for analysis , were of an ethnic or racial background of a sufficiently small group that meaningful comparisons could not be made , or had no dominant racial identity , preferring to identify only as mixed race ."
"as single - item measures do not lend themselves to traditional reliability measures , the instrument was evaluated by several public health eerts external to the project ' s data collection for face validity .",other items were assessed with open - ended responses in which interviewers recorded verbatim responses from subjects .
"comparing those who would take the medication to those who would not ( used as an indicator for inadequate comprehension ) independent samples t - test indicated that those who would not take the drug ( m = 3 , sd = 0 ) were significantly less confident in their ability to identify the causes of the ailment than those who would take the medication ( m = 8 , sd = 4 ; t ( unequal variance ) = 85 , df = 4 , p < . 006 ) .","there were no significant differences between hispanics and african americans in certainty , prevention , emotional responses , or likelihood to take the countermeasure ."
"respondents still were unable to respond with any definition of a word more than one - tenth of the time ( m = 6 , sd = 0 ) .",participants predominantly responded negatively to the words ( see table ) .
"given the findings about the overall challenging language , we further probed understanding of regulatory terms through affective responses .","while participants may not be able to define terms , whether they respond positively or negatively provides insights into their risk information processing ."
"linguistic inquiry and word count ( liwc ) reads a text - based dataset and compares the individual modules of that text to established categories of words , punctuation , and other components of the documents .","the sum of these categories is the liwc dictionary , which has a tone composite category constructed from subcategories focused on the emotionality of words ."
"in other words , people in general are quite negative about the idea of emergency medical countermeasures , significantly beyond what people normally encounter in their daily , nonemergency activities , such as conversations with friends and family and news consumption .","when one considers that the category for comparison most appropriate for this data is natural speech , as the surveys here were collected in face - to - face interviews , it becomes evident that even with the higher value including single - word responses ( 2 - tailed t - test , t = 2 , df = , p < . 001 ) , or without the single - word responses ( 2 - tailed t - test , t = 8 , df = , p < . 001 ) , there is a significant difference between the data here and other forms of eression and a strong negative skew such that people are generally quite negative about emergency medical countermeasures ."
"caucasians had higher trust in the government and the cdc compared to african americans . 000 * p * = bonferroni adjusted significance level determined by a / n , where n is the number of planned comparisons .","specifically , caucasians were the least certain about their ability to recognize an illness and their ability to prevent the illness , and were less pleased , relieved , and confident after being presented with the information ."
"education was measured , but was not included in the final models as the focus of the article was on race / ethnicity .","as such , household income was not included in the instrument or subsequent analyses ."
"importantly , persuasiveness was the only consistent motivating factor across groups , with the second most common factor , fear , having inconsistent directional implications on different demographics .","when viewing table , focus on p values and standardized b values is important for understanding the relationship between variables for decision making across groups ."
the majority of participants reported that they understood that the government was asking them to immediately take the recommended vaccine or medication .,our first research question focused on public understanding of medical countermeasure messages .
this suggests that future research will need to attend more carefully to examining the contribution of message components to any desired behavioral or attitudinal outcomes rather than a more standard approach of examining the effect of the overall message .,"it also suggests that the fda should anticipate that any messages aimed at the general populationand specifically at lower income , immigrant , or minority groups - will require careful attention to literacy levels and english as a second language ."
"participants on average reported being slightly likely to take the medication or vaccine , but compliance was distributed multi - modally , with the largest clusters of individuals grouping at noncompliance and complete compliance .",our second question focused on the extent to which respondents understood and were willing to comply with the recommended countermeasures .
"our results identified strong negativity toward medical countermeasures , even more than eressive writing about tragic personal events , and a substantial undertone of concern about the use of medical countermeasures .",prior research linked high public anxiety to crisis and emergency risk communication .
"indeed , decisions made by caucasians were better elained than for the other groups .","in an analysis on compliance as predicted by information clarity , persuasiveness , fear from reading the information , and trust in government , there were significant differences between caucasians and african americans ."
"recall that trust , when treated as a dependent variable , was predicted by racial / ethnic identity .","however , when trust is an independent predictor of positive behavioral outcomes , the relationship becomes even more complex ."
"furthermore , important racial / ethnic group differences emerged in participants ' informed decision making .","first , compared to other groups , caucasians were least certain about their ability to recognize an illness and their ability to prevent an illness ."
"this may also suggest that the fda , cdc , and their partners should continue to work with other national partners whose credibility with diverse communities may help the agencies disseminate messages that can be more trusted .","finally , the findings suggest that a single factsheet for all groups may not be effective and that agencies communicating about medical countermeasures may wish to develop tailored factsheets for different groups ."
the high proportion of homeless people who participated in this study further limits the study ' s transferability to dissimilar contexts .,"second , the study examined public health emergencies , and the findings are not generalizable to other public health emergencies ."
key and novel findings include : participants demonstrated poor understanding of terminology commonly used by the fda and other government agencies to communicate about medical countermeasures ;,"in sum , this study adds to the extremely limited body of knowledge on how diverse members of the public respond to medical countermeasures issued during public health emergencies ."
"while much is known about effective emergency risk and crisis communication , we cannot continue to assume that this knowledge base transfers to the specific context of medical countermeasures without additional research .",the findings also point to a need for more research testing discrete message components to design medical countermeasure messages that are even more persuasive .
increased ang - / masr signaling has been reported to improve insulin sensitivity and glycemia in diabetic animals .,"altogether , ace2 / ang - / masr axis of the ras appears to be protective in t2dm and strategies to restore ace2 levels in the disease seem to be a promising therapy for ang - ii - mediated t2dm ."
"one of the novel targets to control t2dm could be ace2 , a member of the renin - angiotensin system ( ras ) .",the system has been extensively studied in the context of blood pressure regulation ; however we are just beginning to understand the role of the ras in glucose homeostasis .
"indeed , ang - ii not only affects insulin secretion from the islets but it also adversely affects insulin signaling by stimulating multiple serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor beta - subunit irs - 1 , and the p85 regulatory subunit of pi3 - kinase in the insulin signaling cascade .","interestingly , ang - ii - mediated detrimental effects on insulin signaling can be reversed by arbs ."
"interestingly , it has also been reported to be localized in glucose regulating tissues such as pancreas , including - cells ( 3 , , adipose tissue and liver .","ace2 , a homologue of ace , is highly eressed in kidney , heart , lung and testis ."
this therapeutic property of ace2 is gaining a lot of attention given the ubiquitous role of the ras in regulating various functions in the body .,"hence , ace2 seems to be a protective agent against the detrimental effects mediated through an over - active ras by decreasing the levels of ang - ii and increasing the levels of ang - ."
the ace2 / ang - / masr pathway thus appears to protect cells against oxidative stress .,"conversely , it has been reported that ace2 inhibition or masr blockade exacerbate ang - ii - mediated increase in reactive oxygen species within renal cell nuclei from sheep ."
"ang - ii , by virtue of its vasoconstrictive property , reduces the blood flow to the islets and negatively affects insulin secretion .",suggested that modulation of blood flow to the islets impacts whole body glucose homeostasis .
agents that decrease islet inflammation and fibrosis have been shown to improve glycemia in diabetic subjects .,"while the beneficial actions of ace2 in attenuating fibrosis and inflammation have been reported in heart , lungs and liver , the role of ace2 therapy in possibly ameliorating those detrimental processes in the islets remain to be investigated ."
"interestingly , ras over - activity has been reported to induce er stress ; conversely drugs that can reduce ras - activity might attenuate er stress in hypertension .",er stress appears to be one of the responsible factors for - cell dysfunction and impaired glycemia ; however the role of ang - ii and ace2 in mediating and attenuating er stress respectively in the islets has not yet been determined .
"interestingly , ang - ii up regulates adam17 eression in vascular smooth muscle cells , the brain , adipose tissues and the pancreas .",adam17 - induced ace2 shedding provides an elanation for the observed down - regulation of ace2 in face of ras over - activity in the mouse islets .
"the studies utilize either adenovirus or lentivirus , carrying the ace2 gene , to increase ace2 activity for a short ( 7 - 14 days ) or longterm respectively .","so far , the therapy has shown promising results in diabetic animals ."
ace2 activators appear to be beneficial in attenuating hyperglycemia as well as diabetic complications such as hypertension and endothelial dysfunction in diabetic subjects .,activators of endogenous ace2 such as xanthenone ( xnt ) and diminazene aceture ( dize ) have been identified as compounds capable of increasing ace2 activity to counteract the over - active ras .
human recombinant ace2 ( hrace2 ) has shown promising results in increasing ace2 activity and controlling t2dm complications in animals .,recent reports suggest the role of hrace2 therapy in opposing ang - ii - mediated signaling in diabetic nephropathy .
"interestingly , the beneficial effects conferred by ace inhibition were associated with an increase in plasma levels of ang - in the shr .","moreover , ang - infusion ameliorates the diabetic complications in diabetic rats ."
these effects could be related to our recent observation that masr is located on - cells .,"moreover , ave0991 , a masr agonist , plays a cardioprotective role in diabetic rats and has also been reported to ameliorate the extent of diabetic cardiovascular dysfunction in rats with streptozotocininduced diabetes ."
"the classic ace / ang - ii / at1r axis of the ras is one of the contributing factors that mediates diabetes , whereas the compensatory ace2 / ang - / masr arm provides a novel approach to improve glycemia in t2dm ( fig .",pre - clinical studies reveal that ace2 seems to be a promising therapeutic agent to control t2dm .
"with increasing environmental concerns worldwide , food waste has become a vital issue in many cities .","although some researchers have insisted that food waste can be transformed into a valuable resource , waste is most often perceived as a disgusting and annoying matter that must be eliminated as quickly as possible ( hawkins , ) ."
"in japan , different types of material , including food waste , are collected on a designated date .",residents have to store food waste at home and dispose of them according to a strict waste collection schedule .
"the results of quantitative research can be used to gather major information with respects to respondents ' beliefs , values and attitudes , however , they are not able to address how accurately or truthfully their behaviours and attitudes , and cannot address cause - and - effect relationship ( sommer and sommer , ) .","as yin states , qualitative research can gain useful insights into the complexity of people ' s behaviours ."
"in the past few decades , the hong kong government , environmentalists , non - governmental organisations ( ngos ) and some industries have made tremendous efforts to develop policies and measures on waste disposal and recycling .","according to the report from the environmental protection department ( epd ) in , the local government set out a - year waste disposal plan to develop new facilities and strategies in ."
"during this time of sars outbreak , the government announced emergency measures , such as the cleaning and disinfection of public spaces in buildings .",the enhancement and management of public spaces and facilities in terms of environmental issues became increasingly important in households and communities .
"it table the key schemes , measures , programmes and legislations on food waste in hong kong .",amoy gardens was typical of the most common style of high - rise private housing estates in hong kong built in the s and s .
"distributed free vegetables to some families , such as single - parent families , and elderly living alone in the tin shui wai community .","however , most organisations had to suspend the project due to a lack of financial assistance and many practical problems ."
a series of new initiatives was launched in an attempt to improve the living environment .,"given their narrowness , depth and height , these spaces were often dark and stuffy ."
"public space for gardening was designated on the podium , along with amenities , such as pots and tools , to enable more residents to participate in the gardening process .",each household that participated in the programme could get soil and organic fertiliser for planting .
"however , a growing number of residents were participating in recycling activities .",there existed many challenges in conducting fwr within the physical and particular sociocultural contexts of amoy gardens .
"in this study , data and methodological triangulation were used in two ways : using different methods to examine the same situation .",methodological triangulation requires to crosscheck data regarding the same phenomenon using multiple methods .
"they produce contextual data relating to the natural setting , and strive to observe what people actually do , instead of what they think they do .","observations enable researchers to describe the situation in natural setting and understand how people ' interact ' with surroundings in everyday life ( babbie , ) ."
"in this study , observations were conducted on both weekdays and weekends , including different periods , such as the morning , afternoon , rush hour and evening .","the research area included different public spaces , such as lobbies , podiums , ground floors and lifts , which enabled the researchers to obtain general information on people ' s behaviour and living contexts ."
"in actual practice , it was difficult to obtain informed consent from all of the people who were observed .","to protect the privacy and to maintain the dignity of the participants , most of the people being photographed were informed that they would appear in the photographs and their knowledge or consent was obtained ."
"in these cases , notes were made to document their answers concurrent with or following the interview .",others were uncomfortable and said they could not eress their views freely when they realised that their interviews would be recorded .
"according to the findings , nearly households participated in this programme .","although this was not a high percentage , it provided a viable setting for constructing a sustainable community ."
"due to the high density of living environments , most of the accommodations were very small , especially the kitchens .",many respondents emphasised that their limited living space made it particularly difficult for them to store food waste in their kitchens .
"it is very convenient but i know it is impossible there is not even space to store pots and pans as private living space was limited , public facilities played an important role in fwr .","however , the communal spaces , such as refuse storage rooms on each storey , were also too narrow to allow for the installation of any fwr facilities ."
"food waste was putrescible and may pose hygiene issues , as it contained a large quantity of water .","thus , many respondents indicated that they were not willing to store food waste at home for a whole night ."
"in general , processors decomposed food waste in situ , which were convenient but may generate a disgusting odour during the decomposition process .","to meet more residents ' satisfaction , the fwr programme used an alternative method of dealing with food waste ."
"although the collection time was not h , many of the households indicated that the collection time was acceptable and convenient .",the designated collection time helped avoid the spread of smell and bacteria .
some of them described the implementation and management of waste recycling affecting their motivation and sustainable behaviour .,most of the respondents indicated that they were increasingly aware of the environmental issues and social responsibility of fwr .
we should also ensure that it is easy for us to implement and manage .,this inevitably increases the burden and pressure on our staff members and it is not that necessary .
"however , some respondents who lived on other blocks had different attitudes towards the accessibility and equity of public recycling facilities .",some respondents found them inconvenient to use because there were no facilities provided on their own blocks .
"respondent : it is impractical for me and my neighbours , who live far away , to bring our food waste to a collection point basically , i have to take the elevator to the lobby and transfer to another elevator carrying such smelly and wet food waste it is so inconvenient .","if these facilities were provided on my block , i would definitely participate in them ."
"consequently , the way they behaved seemed to have nothing to do with their surroundings , and they showed little interest in recycling .","in hong kong , most local residents felt isolated in the community , as they lived in high - rise and high - density buildings ."
respondent : it has very much to do with our cooperation we should work together and help each other .,"gardening in a public space is a very good idea it not only encourages us to participate in food waste separation , but it also enables us to do this right thing together ."
it was easy for participants to recognise their own and their neighbours ' plants .,"in the garden , each container had a number plate sticking into the soil , representing the household number ."
"when they were asked about their attitudes towards their neighbourhood , they showed a glow of satisfaction with having a good place that enhanced their opportunities to participate in community activities .",the participants in the scheme said they often came to the garden in the evening after dinner or when they were passing by .
the public space on the rooftop was divided into several areas according to different types of vegetables .,it provided an opportunity for residents to communicate with their family .
the quality of built environments and facility design affects sustainable behaviour .,it is thus necessary to consider the challenges to fwr and how to improve design for greater public participation .
"contextual factors such as physical infrastructure , technical facilities and the availability of public facilities have also been considered as factors that are highly correlated with sustainable behaviour ( steg and vlek , ) .","different from cities with low population densities , the particular high - rise and high - density living situation in hong kong has brought many challenges to fwr ."
"in most of the housing in hong kong , especially public housing estates , both private and public spaces are limited , which makes it difficult to set up fwr facilities .","however , many factors such as safety and space affect the systematic or effective implementation of food waste collection in public spaces ."
"in other words , all intervention attempts are passive in nature , from ' i urge you to ' enabling approaches and ' i ask you to ' motivating approaches to ' i order you to ' constraining approaches .","compared with other strategies , such as information , education , economic incentives and punishment , design for collaboration is regarded as a modest strategy that indirectly changes undesired behaviour ."
"in addition to traditional interventions , such as education , propaganda , economic incentives and waste management , public design for participation and collaboration can form an active environment in which to establish relationships between individuals and their communities .",a key finding of this study suggests that enhancing the quality of public design based on particular physical and cultural contexts is helpful to develop recycling behaviour .
"nevertheless , it provides insights into public design in many similar high - rise residential buildings in hong kong as well as singapore and mainland china .",the findings of this study may not be widely applied to suburban areas and low - density residential areas .
"this study contributes to the qualitative literature on waste recycling in high - rise and high - density buildings , which has mainly focused on public design based on physical and cultural contexts .","nonparticipant observations enable to describe the situation in natural settings and observe what people actually do , whilst interviews enable to identify why people act as they do and the reasons behind their behaviour ( yin , ) ."
"however , attitudes and opinions from different stakeholders should be addressed in advance .","to find appropriate solutions , policymakers , designers and management staffs should communicate with users and help them eress their opinions frequently , especially in the early stages ."
only when people have a close connection with the community do they care about their surroundings and become keen to participate in community recycling activities .,it is a potential approach for increasing residents ' motivation to fwr in high - rise buildings .
future perspectives and possible challenges in this rapidly developing area are also discussed .,"in particular , the biofunctionalization of graphene for biological applications , fluorescence - resonance - energytransfer - based biosensor development by using graphene or graphene - based nanomaterials , and the investigation of graphene or graphene - based nanomaterials for living cell studies are summarized in more detail ."
"hence , the advancement of nanomaterial research plays an essential role in the eloration of the biochemical and nanotechnological fields .","today , impressive achievements have been made at the cross - section of nanotechnology and biotechnology by employing modern nanomaterials as elements to generate mechanical , optical , and electronic devices and biosensors ."
"during the past several years , various methods for producing graphene have been developed , such as micromechanical exfoliation , chemical vapour deposition , epitaxial growth , and chemically synthesis ( see box for more details ) .","although graphene is the fundamental basis of different carbon forms , it was first prepared unambiguously in , years after the invention of graphite , by peeling a single layer of graphene using sticky tape and a pencil ."
"for example , electronic dispersion in the graphene lattice is shown in figure c .","according to the linear dispersion of the electron energy ( e ) with respect to the wave vector ( k ) , the dirac equation that describes the linear e - k relation is"
", where the fermi velocity v f is about m / s .","it is eected that quasiparticles in graphene behave differently from those in conventional metals and semiconductors , which exhibit a parabolic dispersion relation ."
"moreover , recent achievements using graphene as an ad - vanced transporter for drug delivery , as well as bioimaging in living cells , are summarized at the end of this article .","fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( fret ) biosensors based on graphene and its derivates are then discussed , with the sensing applications ranging from small molecules and dna to proteins and cells ."
"it can be wrapped up into d buckyballs , rolled into d nanotubes , or stacked into d graphite .",graphene is a d building material for carbon materials of all other dimensionalities .
"the resultant ssdna - graphene biointerface has been used in a field - effect transistor ( fet ) for the label - free , reversible detection of complementary ssdna .","through a self - assembly process under strong ultrasonication , monolayers of ssdna molecules have been adsorbed on both sides of graphene sheets by p - p stacking ."
"for example , epitaxial growth of single - and multi - layered graphene epitaxy on ru has been observed by in situ surface microscopy , with characterization by electron scattering and microscopy .","cvd epitaxial growth is another approach for production of graphene , by dissolving carbon into a nickel substrate , and then forcing it to precipitate out by cooling the nickel ."
graphene efficiently preconcentrated the ssdna and served as a direct platform for seldi - tof - ms analysis .,has been used directly for the study of surface - enhanced laser desorption ionization time - of - flight mass spectrometry ( seldi - tof - ms ) .
"graphene and go have been tethered with various proteins , which results in biosystems with unique properties .","for example , an enzyme immobilization matrix based on go has been reported ."
"the diameter and graphene - shell thickness of the prepared nanowire were nm and nm , respectively .","then , peptide / graphene core / shell nanowires were immediately created as soon as an organic peptide solution ( 100 mg / ml solution of diphenylalanine in , 1,1 , 3,3 , 3 - hexafluoro - 2 - propanol ) was diluted in aqueous graphene dispersion under mild mechanical shaking ."
"fret involves the transfer of energy from a donor fluorophore to an acceptor fluorophore , and is one of the advanced tools available for measuring nanometer - scale distance and changes , both in vivo and in vitro .",there is increasing interest in the use of graphene for the development of fret biosensors ( figure ) .
mbs do not fluoresce until they have hybridized with the target nas .,the unique thermodynamics and specificity of mbs have led to their broad application in biotechnology .
"employed as the ' nanoquencher ' , with increased sensitivity and single - base mismatch selectivity for target dna .",an mb - based go fret biosensor has also been integrated with qds as fluorophores owning to its broad absorption and narrow emission spectra .
"graphene - based biotechnology for living cell studies as outlined above , the unique ability of dna adsorption , super quenching capacity , and protection from enzyme cleavage have resulted in graphene being a robust artificial nanomaterial in biotechnology , and a novel candidate to be utilized in biomedical investigations , including in vivo targeting of cellular atp and in situ localization of mrna , realtime monitoring , drug delivery , and cell imaging .","in this section , we selectively emphasize such applications of graphene and graphene - based nanomaterials in living cells ."
"the aptamer - fam / go - ns complex , coupled with a wide - field fluorescence microscope , serves as a real - time sensing platform ( figure ) .",atp recognition by the atp aptamer has been used as a model system to elucidate certain properties and advantages of the go nanosheet : ( i ) go - ns can serve as a transporter of dna aptamers into living cells ; ( ii ) go - ns shows efficient protection of oligonucleotides from enzymatic cleavage during delivery to inter - or intracellular spaces ; and ( iii ) go - ns can act as a real - time sensing platform in living cells with high fluorescence quenching efficiency .
graphene - based fets have been reported in recent studies as promising chemical and biological sensors in living cells .,"graphene fet for living cell detection nanomaterial - based fets have been proven to be powerful building elements for nanoscale bioelectronic interfaces with cells and tissues , owing to their ability to form coupled interfaces with cell membranes ."
trends in biotechnology a fam - labeled atp aptamer was first incubated with go - ns to produce the aptamer - fam / go - ns nanocomplex .,"then , the nanocomplex was cultured together with jb6 cells and observed with a wide - field microscope ."
"with the success of the above studies , it is likely that graphene - based nanocarriers will find widespread application in biomedicine in the future .",ngss with a biocompatible coating might therefore constitute a novel type of d nanomaterial with great potential in cancer therapy .
"pristine graphene possesses a super quenching ability for fret applications , but it is highly hydrophobic .",control of the size and number of single layers of graphene separated from bulk graphite might be the foremost challenge for the application of graphene as the building block of functionalized biosystems .
virus tanomy brings into sharp focus the debate about the true nature of viruses .,a comprehensive classification system should define boundaries within what may at first appear as a continuum of properties .
"since all viruses , whatever the host , share the properties described in the preceding chapter , virologists have developed a single system of classification and nomenclature that covers all viruses - this is a system overseen by the international committee on tanomy of viruses ( ictv ) .",one challenge of virus classification is to define evolutionary relationships between viruses when minor changes in molecular structures may give rise to pathogens with radically different properties ( fig .
"the earliest efforts to classify viruses were based upon host organism species , common clinical and pathological properties , tropism for particular tissues and organs , and common ecological and transmission characteristics .","although it is hierarchical and at most levels reflects evolutionary relationships , the tanomy of viruses is deliberately non - systematic - that is , there is no intent to relate all viruses to an ancient evolutionary root - in fact , there is good evidence for several separate roots ."
". type of nucleic acid ( dna or rna ) ; . virion size , as determined by ultrafiltration and electron microscopy ; . virion morphology , as determined by electron microscopy ; . virion stability , as determined by varying ph and temperature , eure to lipid solvents and detergents , etc .","; and . virion antigenicity , as determined by various serological methods ."
"subsequently it has been necessary in most cases to determine only a few characteristics in order to place a newly described virus into an established tan , as a starting point for further work to define its relationship with other members .","for example , an isolate from the respiratory tract of a child with croup , identified by negative contrast electron microscopy as an adenovirus , might be submitted immediately for serological identification - it would certainly turn out to be a member of the family adenoviridae , genus mastadenovirus ( the adenoviruses of mammals ) , and would be serologically identified as one of the > 50 human adenoviruses - or perhaps , it would turn out to be a new human adenovirus !"
"reference genome sequences for all viral taxa are available in public databases ( e . g . , genbank , national center for biotechnology information , national library of medicine , national institutes of health , bethesda , maryland , united states : < > ) .",such an approach in most cases allows one to immediately place a virus in a specific tan .
"as of the universal tanomy system for viruses encompasses seven orders , four of which contain human and animal pathogens ( picornavirales , herpesvirales , mononegavirales , and nidovirales ) , and families , of which contain human and / or animal pathogens , genera , and species of viruses ( table . 1 ) .","this situation is constantly changing , and the interested reader should consult the ictv website for updates ( ."
virus families are broadly divisible into those with dna or rna genomes respectively .,"viruses within each family possess broadly similar genome structure , virion morphology , and replication strategy ."
"again , since all viruses did not derive from a common ancestor , there is no intent to construct a unified viral evolutionary tree .","orders are used to group together those virus families with related but distant phylogenetic properties ( e . g . , conserved genes , sequences , or domains ) ."
the criteria by which different species within a genus are distinguished shall be established by the appropriate study group .,"a species is a monophyletic ( "" relating to or descended from one source or tan "" ) group of viruses , whose properties can be distinguished from those of other species by multiple criteria ."
"even though there has been little disagreement over the use of this system at the order , family , or genus level , there has been considerable confusion at the species level , partly based in misunderstanding over the difference between the man - made tanomic construction , the species , and the actual entity , the virus .","using the above tanomic system brings a number of practical benefits , including the ability to relate a newly found virus to similar agents that have already been described and thereby to anticipate some of its possible properties , and the ability to infer possible evolutionary relationships between viruses ."
"at the time of writing , no mimivirus - like agent causing human illness has yet been found ; still the discovery of mimiviruses has had a profound influence on our understanding of virus evolution and on our sense of what is yet to be discovered .","a full discussion regarding the origin of viruses is outside the scope of this book , suffice it to say that some virologists argue that rna viruses have evolved many aeons before the appearance of dna viruses ."
"for example , the vernacular name "" bunyavirus "" might refer to the family bunyaviridae , to the genus orthobunyavirus , or perhaps even to one particular species , bunyamwera virus .",one particular problem in vernacular nomenclature lies in the historic use of the same root terms in family and genus names - it is sometimes difficult to determine which level is being cited .
"in this book , we have tried to hold to the name style used most commonly for each virus , but since this is mostly a matter of vernacular usage the reader may often find variations .","the basis for this lies in history - some , but not all , of the viruses isolated early on assumed the former name style , whereas most viruses discovered more recently have been identified using the latter style ."
enteric viruses are usually acquired by ingestion ( fecal - oral transmission ) and replicate primarily in the intestinal tract .,"the term is usually restricted to viruses that remain localized in the intestinal tract , rather than causing generalized infections ."
"respiratory viruses are included in the families picornaviridae ( genus enterovirus ) , caliciviridae , coronaviridae , paramyviridae ( genera respirovirus , rubulavirus , pneumovirus , and metapneumovirus ) , orthomyviridae , and adenoviridae .","the term is usually restricted to viruses that remain localized in the respiratory tract , rather than causing generalized infections ."
"arboviruses are included in the families togaviridae , flaviviridae , rhabdoviridae , bunyaviridae , and reoviridae ( genera orbivirus and coltivirus ) .","the occasional passive transfer of virus on contaminated mouthparts ( "" the flying pin "" ) does not constitute sufficient grounds for a virus to be identified as an arbovirus ."
hepatitis viruses are grouped as such because the main target organ for these viruses is the liver .,"hepatitis a , b , c , d , and e viruses each belong to completely unrelated tanomic families ."
"oncogenic viruses usually cause persistent infection and may produce transformation of host cells , which may in turn progress to malignancy .","viruses that have oncogenic potential , in eerimental animals or in nature , are included in the families herpesviridae , adenoviridae , papillomaviridae , polyomaviridae , hepadnaviridae , retroviridae , and flaviviridae ."
"these simple postulates were originally drawn up for bacteria , but were revised in by thomas rivers and again in by alfred evans in attempts to accommodate the special problem of proving disease causation by viruses .",one of the landmarks in the history of infectious diseases was the development of the henle - koch postulates that established the evidence required to prove a causal relationship between a particular infectious agent and a particular disease .
"in other examples , the causal relationships of epstein - barr ( eb ) virus to the disease infectious mononucleosis , and of australia antigen ( later known as hepatitis b surface antigen ) to clinical hepatitis , were each established by matching serological evidence of acute infection with the timing of onset of clinical disease .","further , the complex role of eb virus in burkitt ' s lymphoma was investigated in a large prospective study carried out by the international agency for research on cancer ( iarc ) on , 000 children in an area of high incidence of burkitt ' s lymphoma in africa ."
"it also now happens frequently using modern diagnostic methods , that viruses are recovered from individuals with some ongoing disease ; however , careful work is essential in such cases to distinguish a true causative role from an unrelated infection of no clinical significance occurring at the same time .","thus , for many associations between a virus and a clinical disease , the concept of infection representing a "" risk factor "" is more appropriate than it being an absolute "" cause . """
multiple sequence alignment and the construction of phylogenetic trees are now commonplace when virologists are confronted with either a potentially new virus or an isolate with new or uneected properties .,these data are rapidly challenging previous ideas about the origin and evolution of many viruses of medical importance .
"the common conserved sequences employed here are at the lower limit of significance , but similarities in some functional and structural protein domains still appear among otherwise unrelated viruses in various taxa .",sequence analyses also suggest that it is unlikely that many more associations of diverse taxa will be found that warrant construction of further orders .
"similarly , some member viruses of the family bunyaviridae have been found to be natural reassortants with genes from known and unknown ancestors .","for example , the origin of the influenza ( h1n1 ) pandemic has been found to be complex indeed : the virus is a reassortant with genes from four different ancestral viruses - north american swine influenza , north american avian influenza , human influenza , and swine influenza virus typically found in asia and europe ."
"philipeaux , reported on the effects of adrenalectomy in albino rats in ( philipeaux , ) .",rats were used in eeriments only sporadically in europe and north america until about .
"characteristics such as a short gestation and a relatively short life span , docile behavior , and ready availability of animals with well - defined health and genetic backgrounds are responsible for the importance of the rat as a laboratory animal .","the rat is a standard species for toxicological , teratological , and carcinogenesis testing by the pharmaceutical industry and governmental regulatory agencies ."
"wall , ceiling , and floor surfaces should be made of materials that allow for effective sanitation and that resist damage from normal use and manipulation of equipment .","the environment of the room should be well controlled , to ensure animal well - being and to help limit variables to those of the eerimental design ."
"prevention and control of infectious diseases are partially a function of the location , size , and environmental conditions of a rat housing room .",strategies for limiting the transfer of pathogens will vary according to the potential impact that infectious agents may have on a particular group of rats and the study in which they are being used .
this section provides a summary of some of the morphophysiological characteristics of the rat that may be useful to the reader .,"for more comprehensive descriptions , see the references cited in this section ."
"in the female , there are usually teats , with three pairs in the pectoral and three pairs in the abdominal region ( greene , ) .","hair growth in the young rat is cyclic , with the resting period and the growing period each being days ."
"rat eyes are ehthalmic , which increases the risk of injury from trauma and drying during anesthesia .","the eyelids are well developed , and only the cornea is visible ."
the parotid gland is serous and consists of three or four lobes located ventrolaterally from the caudal border of the mandible to the clavicle .,the submandibular glands are mixed glands situated ventrally between the caudal border of the mandibles and the thoracic inlet .
"the stomach is divided into two parts : the forestomach , or cardiac portion , which is nonglandular ; and the corpus , or pyloric portion , which is glandular .","a structure referred to as the limiting ridge ( margo plicatus ) separates the two portions , with the esophagus entering at the lesser curvature of the stomach through a fold of the ridge ."
"the liver has four lobes : the median , which has a deep fissure for the hepatic ligament ; the right lateral , which is partially divided ; the left , which is large ; and the caudate , which is small and surrounds the esophagus .","the rat does not have a gallbladder , and bile ducts from each lobe form the common bile duct , which enters the duodenum about mm from the pyloric sphincter ."
"numerous excretory ducts fuse into two to eight large ducts , which empty into the common bile duct ( bivin et al . , ) .","figure . 2 depicts the abdominal and thoracic viscera in situ ( greene , ) ."
"the recess contains the lateral nasal gland ( steno ' s gland ) , which has morphologic similarities to a serous laboratory animal medicine salivary gland and secretes a watery product discharged at the rostral end of the nasal turbinate .",the rat has a maxillary recess ( sinus ) located between the maxillary bone and the lateral lamina of the ethmoid bone .
the pulmonary vein has cardiac striated muscle fibers within its wall that are contiguous with those in the heart .,"the lungs consist of the left lung , which is singlelobed , and the right lung , which is divided into the cranial , middle , accessory , and caudal lobes ."
"the female rat has a bicornate uterus , and although the uterine horns appear fused distally , there are two distinct ossa uteri and cervices .","within the abdominal cavity and surrounding the bladder are the large vesicular glands ( seminal vesicles ) and the prostate gland , which is composed of the dorsocranial ( coagulation gland ) , ventral , and dorsolateral lobes ."
"like the kidneys of other rodents , the rat kidney is unipapillate , making the rat useful for studies in which cannulization of the kidney is done .","the rat is also widely used as a model for investigating nephron transport in an in vivo micropuncture system , because of the presence of superficial nephrons in the renal cortex ( vallon , ) ."
"the hypophysis ( pituitary gland ) lies behind the optic chiasma and is attached to the base of the brain by a thin hollow stalk , the infundibulum .","the brain is characterized by large olfactory bulbs , a lissencephalic ( smooth ) cerebrum , and the two parafloccular lobes of the cerebellum , which lie in deep sockets of the periotic capsule of the skull ."
"the heart is eed to the left thoracic wall between the third and fifth ribs , making it a useful site for cardiac blood collection that for humane reasons is generally perfumed as a sedated , nonsurvival procedure .","the blood supply to the atria of the rat , unlike that of higher mammals , is largely extracoronary from branches of the internal mammary and subclavian arteries ."
"selected physiological , clinical chemistry , and hematological values are listed in tables - 4.5 .","other factors such as age , pathogen status , sample collection methods , and husbandry conditions of the colony are also important variables ( suber and kodell , ; dameron et al . , ; perez et al . , ) ."
"chemically defined diets are formulated with very basically defined ingredients ( e . g . , specific amino acids , sugars , triglycerides , and essential fatty acids ) .",the downside of this class of diets is that they are more eensive and often less palatable .
laboratory animal medicine feeding of rats on long - term carcinogenesis and toxicological studies reduces longevity and increases the incidence of neoplasia relative to rats fed at - 80% of the ad libitum food amount .,"these effects have been found in sprague - dawley , wistar , and f - 344 rats and have caused increased variability among - year carcinogenicity and safety assessment studies , compromising the usefulness of bioassays in risk assessment ( keenan et al . , ) ."
"ova remain viable for approximately - 12 h ( fox and laird , ) .","ovulation occurs approximately - 11 h after the onset of estrus , usually between midnight and a . m . ( peluso , ) , although this would obviously depend on timing of the light cycle ."
"sperm are first produced at about - 46 days of age , but fertility ( puberty ) does not occur until approximately - 65 days of age , and sperm production is not maximal until days of age ( russell , ) .","interestingly , on histologic examination of young rat testes , more degenerate germ cells are noted prior to days of age than afterward , indicative of the poor efficiency of spermatogenesis at early ages in the rat ( russell et al . , ) ."
a single ejaculation with fewer intromissions is less likely to impregnate the female .,"multiple intromissions , each lasting - 0.6 s and with two to nine pelvic thrusts ( bennett and vickery , ) , precede the first ejaculation , which lasts about s . this first series of intromissions is called the ejaculatory latency and lasts about min , followed by a refractory period ( dewsbury , ) ."
"this is due to cornification of the laboratory animal medicine vaginal epithelium during estrus ( baker , ) .","these changes in the vaginal epithelium can be assessed by cytologic examination of vaginal smears ( montes and luque , ) ."
"pregnancy is difficult to detect early in gestation , but conception rates of % or more are often observed for outbred rat stocks , somewhat less in inbred strains .","after approximately days , careful palpation can detect the developing fetuses ; this is especially accurate after days of gestation ."
outbred rats may also be bred monogamously but are more often bred polygamously by commercial breeders for reasons of economy .,"inbred rats are generally bred monogamously or in trios , with one male and two females in each cage ."
"caloric restriction , a - 30% decrease from ad libitum caloric intake , may cause cessation of estrous cycles and delayed sexual maturation ( fox and laird , ) .","chronic eure to even low - intensity light during the dark cycle has been reported to result in earlier vaginal opening and ovarian atrophy ( beys et al . , ; fox and laird , ) ."
"significantly , the damage may occur in rats as young as days and in rats with prolonged eure to temperatures as low as c .","high ambient temperatures can result in male infertility ( pucak et al . , ) by causing irreversible degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium ."
"in addition , at least some maternal stressors can lead to fetal wastage .","an increase in fetal wastage was reported to be due to an earthquake that occurred when the dams were at , , or days of gestation , although no difference was noted in the number of live births , fetal weight , or incidence of runts ( fujinaga et al . , ) ."

"electroejacuation of rats is possible , but the use of sperm collected in this fashion for artificial insemination ( ai ) in rats is complicated by the rapid coagulation of semen , especially when the semen is obtained by electroejaculation , due to the contributions of the coagulating glands and seminal vesicles ( bennett and vickery , ) .","for this reason , electroejaculation may have more practicality as a method for evaluation of reproductive soundness in male rats ( mccoy et al . , ) ."
"microinsemination of individual oocytes via intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( icsi ) is a specific ivf technique that has the potential for being used to rescue or maintain strains that do not produce motile spermatozoa , as it has been used in mice ( tanemura et al . , ; songsasen and leibo , ) .","by adding egenous dna to the process , it can also be eloited as a method for producing transgenic rats ( hirabayashi et al . , ) ."

"frequent gentle handling will increase docility , which not only reduces the likelihood of occupational injury for animal workers but also avoids stress for the rats .",rats from a sprague - dawley background ( such as the cd and sd stocks ) and lewis rats are generally more docile than brown norway or f - 344 rats .
"for example , pain threshold is often determined in a tail flick test .",this circadian rhythm is relevant to a broad range of behavioral measurements .
"this may be of significance when fasting rats for gastric procedures , quantifying fecal output volume or measuring intestinal absorption of some agents .","rats , like other rodents , are coprophagic and vary considerably between individuals in the percentage of feces consumed ."
"however , as the emphasis on group housing begins to change the way institutions care for their animals , it needs to be recognized that a shift from single to group housing can function as a significant variable in a broad range of eerimental studies .","such changes should be discussed with all groups involved so that the potential effects on the research study can be elored proactively by consulting the relevant literature , and also so that unanticipated effects can be recognized and evaluated retrospectively ."
"when provided with objects as part of an environmental enrichment program , rats will chew on inanimate objects such as wooden blocks and nylon bones and balls ( watson , ; chmiel and noonan , ) .","when afforded the choice , rats have shown preferences for solid flooring , bedding consisting of large particles of aspen wood chips , and nest boxes ( manser et al . , a ( manser et al . , , b , a blom et al . , ) , although the consequences of being deprived of the preferred housing factors have not been reported ."
"discussion of bacterial disease in laboratory rats is also compounded by changes in pathogen prevalence across north america , europe , and japan , such that many of the ' classical ' pathogens of rats such as corynebacterium kutscheri and mycoplasma pulmonis are very rare ( pritchett - corning et al . , ; livingston and riley , ) .","however , they should not be forgotten , as they not only persist in wild populations and pet rodents , but there are many other regions of the bioresearch world where pathogen prevalence profiles cannot be assumed ."

"affected rats may become bacteremic and may develop fibrinopurulent inflammation of other serous surfaces ( e . g . , peritoneum , synovium ) and other tissues .","pathology reports of disease associated with s . pneumonia in rats resembles that in both human and nonhuman primates , characterized by suppurative inflammation in the upper respiratory tract , which spreads to the lung to cause bronchopneumonia ( kohn and barthold , ) and sometimes fibrinosuppurative pleuritis ."
differentiation of s . pneumoniae from other - hemolytic streptococci is most often performed by the optochin inhibition test .,optochin inhibition is greater for most s . pneumoniae strains than for other - hemolytic streptococci .
"depopulation can be performed , followed by restocking with animals from a clean source that are maintained to remain spf via the use of standard exclusion techniques .","prevention and control contamination with this agent is rare in contemporary colonies , and since there may be nonpathogenic strains , action to eliminate s . pneumoniae is only indicated in the presence of characteristic lesions or detection of known pathogenic serotypes ."
"exclusion of - hemolytic streptococci from most rat colonies is neither necessary nor practical , for humans are often carriers .","enterococcus spp . , which are not truly streptococci , are often considered together with streptococcus spp ."
"in rats , mice , guinea pigs , and hamsters , c . kutscheri is the cause of pseudotuberculosis , although in the last two species , there is only bacteriological evidence , i . e . , no disease has been reported .","etiology corynebacterium kutscheri is a gram - positive coryneform ( club - shaped ) bacterium which can be found in soil , sewage , and marine environments , and has been elored for possible utility of bioremediation of oil spills ( oyetibo et al . , ) ."

the lesions are due to septic emboli becoming trapped in organs and tissues that contain an extensive capillary network .,"pathology gross lesions of c . kutscheri infection consist of solitary or multiple randomly distributed abscesses in the lung , liver , kidney , skin , and joints ."
"the oral cavity , cecum , colon , and rectum may also harbor the organism .","as feces have been identified in mice as a suitable culture site , they may also be a suitable sample for pcr , although this has not been confirmed in rats ."
"differential diagnosis differential diagnosis for the presence of multiple abscesses in rats should include streptococcosis , streptobacillosis , mycoplasmosis ( pulmonary abscesses ) , cilia - associated respiratory ( car ) bacillus infection ( pulmonary abscesses ) , or other miscellaneous bacteria .","of these , only mycoplasmosis and car bacillus infection would be found predominantly in older animals ."

epizootiology and transmission clostridium piliforme is transmitted horizontally in rats by spores through fecal - oral contamination .,"the spores are highly resistant to desiccation and some disinfectants ( ganaway , ) ."
"overt disease in rats , as in other species , is most likely to be observed in young , recently weaned animals .","in these , the clinical signs are nonspecific ( anorexia , lethargy , emaciation , ruffled fur ) and may include acute death without clinical signs ."
"disease provocation tests , or stress tests , to exacerbate latent infections are sometimes used as a follow - up test when serologic positive results are obtained .","serologic screening is rapid and technically simple ( motzel and riley , ) but is subject to false positives , yielding results that can be difficult to put into context , as has been recently reported in rabbits ( pritt et al . , ) ."
"however , the fact the organism produces spores suggests that cross - contamination from conventional or wild - caught colonies could be more likely , and very thorough decontamination would be indicated after an outbreak .","prevention and control as is the case with the other bacterial diseases described in this section , control in contemporary colonies is through the use of exclusion techniques ."
diagnosis and differential diagnosis screening for p . pneumotropica may be conducted by either culture or pcr .,"culture is best conducted on the sites mentioned above , although feces , oral swabs , or even dust that has accumulated in animal air spaces , such as within the plenum of some individually ventilated caging systems , are all suitable for pcr ."
"rederivation by either cesarean section or embryo transfer will also eliminate the agent ( nicklas , ) .","offspring should also be held in strict isolationi . e . , not mixed in with a breeding colony - until confirmed negative for p . pneumotropica ."
"the tanomic classification and subdivision of the genus remain somewhat controversial and , like much tanomy , subject to change .","all salmonellas that one is likely to encounter in rats belong to s . enterica which comprises more than serovars ( tindall et al . , ; timme et al . , ) ."
"salmonella enterica is transmitted by ingestion of contaminated materials , including feed , bedding , or water .",incursion of wild or feral rodents into a laboratory facility poses a further risk .
"soft stools and diarrhea may also be observed , usually in less than % of animals .","clinical signs as in most species , clinical signs of infection with s . enterica in rats are rare but may include a hunched posture , ruffled fur , lethargy , weight loss , and conjunctivitis ."
"pathology in rats with subclinical infections , gross and microscopic lesions will usually be absent .","rats with clinical disease may have evidence of gastrointestinal involvement and septicemia , including mural thickening and mucosal ulcers in the cecum and ileum , as well as splenomegaly ."
diagnosis colony screening is most often conducted on fecal samples by microbiologic culture or by pcr .,"suspected cases of salmonellosis may also be tested by culture or pcr of feces , mesenteric lymph nodes , liver , spleen , or blood ."
good personal hygiene of employees will prevent them from serving as a source of salmonella or other enteric pathogens to the colony .,prevention and control salmonellosis is prevented by rigorous pest control and by ensuring that food and bedding are not contaminated .
"epizootiology and transmission pseudomonas aeruginosa is motile , aerobic , oxidase - positive , and widely distributed in water , soil , sewage , and the skin and gastrointestinal tract of many animals .","it is considered as part of the common commensal flora of humans , domestic animals , and laboratory rodents and isolation frequency increases in animals and humans receiving antibiotics ( kiska and gilligan , ) ."
"however , caution should be exercised in attributing observed morbidity and mortality to an organism as nearly ubiquitous as p . aeruginosa .","although pseudomonas will grow on blood agar , isolation is enhanced by the use of selective media , such as pseudomonas isolation agar , or pseudomonas agar p . the use of selective media is particularly recommended when screening clinically healthy animals , because only low numbers of organisms may be harbored in the common sites for isolation , the cecum , and nasopharynx ."
animals must be maintained in isolators or microisolators and must be routinely monitored .,"prevention and control exclusion of p . aeruginosa is rarely justified in a research setting as it requires gnotobiotic methods and sterilization of all water reaching the animals , as well as sterilization of cages , feed , and bedding ."
"the agent is a gram - negative pleomorphic bacillus , which will grow nonhemolytically on sheep blood agar , although trypticase soy agar enriched with % horse serum is preferred ( weisbroth , ; savage , ) .","this zoonotic agent is virtually nonexistent in modern laboratory animals but nonetheless bears brief mention because of the potentially serious consequences of infection ( anderson et al . , ; wullenweber , ) ."
"colonies of laboratory rats are monitored by pcr or by culture of blood and nasopharyngeal swabs for streptobacillus moniliformis , and any colony in which the organism is confirmed should immediately be terminated .","because wild rats are the reservoir for s . moniliformis , detection of this delicate bacterium in a laboratory rat colony would indicate close - range eure to infected wild rats ."
"all currently identified helicobacters of laboratory rats are microaerophilic , gram - negative flagellated bacteria that may be spiral , slightly curved , or straight .",no lesions were attributed to helicobacter in any of the rats .
"many other helicobacter species , however , are able to colonize a phylogenetically wide range of mammalian hosts .","with the exception of an attempt to transmit h . pullorum by soiled bedding , no studies have been published on the transmission of naturally occurring helicobacter infections in rats ."
mucosal erosion and ulceration were observed in the cecum of the most severely affected rats .,"the lamina propria was infiltrated by lymphocytes , plasma cells , and a few eosinophils ."
"culture is generally considered to have less sensitivity for detecting helicobacters , so negative culture results must be interpreted cautiously .","fox and lee recommend passage of cecal contents through a 5 - m filter , then culture on brucella agar with antibiotics ( trimethoprim , vancomycin , polymyxin ) to suppress growth of unwanted organisms that are not removed by the filter ."
"however , given the uncertainty as to the full host range of rat helicobacters , the possibility of transmission by humans is difficult to exclude .",the usual source of infection for helicobacter infection in rats is nonetheless eected to be contaminated rodents or other laboratory animals .
several antibiotic regimens have been reported to be successful for mice and might similarly be attempted in rats .,these have primarily involved oral dosing with antibiotics by gavage several times each day or incorporation of antibiotics into the diet .
epizootiology and transmission transmission is primarily via direct contact with infected animals .,"fomites probably do not play a significant role in natural transmission of car bacillus , and bedding does not transmit the infection well cundiff et al . , b ) ."
"coinfection with mycoplasma pulmonis or other pathogens may occur , resulting in suppurative bronchopneumonia .","histopathologically , hyperplastic peribronchial and peribronchiolar mononuclear cell cuffs are observed in the lungs ( itoh et al . , ; ."
"pcr may be positive prior to serologic conversion , and samples for pcr may be collected as nasal swabs as a nonterminal procedure ( franklin et al . , ) .","therefore , car bacillus may be readily detected by pcr ( cundiff et al . , ) , which may serve as an important confirmatory test to follow positive serologic results ."
"because the infection is not transmitted well by aerosol or fomites , it may be possible to control the spread of infection .","however , the eense , the labor , and the consequences of possible failure would have to be weighed against the value of saving some of the rats ."
mycoplasma pulmonis is transmitted horizontally by direct contact and aerosol and vertically by in utero transmission .,"the infection is rare in north america ( pritchett - corning et al . , ) ."
"clinical signs although infection can begin in young rats , clinical signs are usually observed only in older animals ; m . pulmonis infection is clinically silent in young animals .","clinical signs are nonspecific , referable to the respiratory and auditory involvement , and include rales and dyspnea , snuffling and chattering , and ocular and nasal discharges , as well as chromodacryorrhea , rubbing of eyes , and head tilt ."
"note that due to the sensitivity of the organism to desiccation , it is doubtful whether soiled bedding would be effective in transmitting it to sentinels .","pathology , including gross examination , and histopathology should not be considered diagnostic by themselves but may provide guidance in selecting more definitive tests such as pcr on deparaffinized tissue ."
iatrogenic lesions due to gavage errors should also be considered a possibility .,"viral infections are less likely to be mistaken for mrm , but intercurrent infections are common , including sendai virus , pneumonia virus of mice , and others ."
"antibiotics such as tetracycline have been used historically to minimize symptoms and prolong survival of affected animals in order to salvage long - tern studies , but antimicrobial eradication is unlikely .","prevention and control use of high - quality vendors , careful sanitation practices , segregation of clean colonies from conventional or wild rodents and isolation and testing of rats imported from suspect sources are steps commonly taken to protect research colonies ."
"it has also confounded the diagnosis of pulmonary lymphoproliferative disease in toxicology safety testing ( schoeb et al . , a , b ) .","research complications mycoplasma pulmonis interferes with research by its effects on the immune system , the respiratory system , and the reproductive system and by being a primary cause of early mortality in infected colonies ( cassell et al . , ; swing et al . , ; lindsey et al . , lindsey et al . , , ."
"etiology mycoplasma haemomuris , formerly haemobartonella muris , is a gram - negative bacterium parasitizes erythrocytes of rats ( neimark et al . , ( neimark et al . , , .",it is an obligate parasite and cannot be grown in vitro .
"however , the potential exists for infection of biological materials , which would provide a route of introduction into rat colonies .","epizootiology and transmission because m . haemomuris is transmitted by the spiny rat louse , polyplax spinulosa , which is very rare in modern laboratory animal facilities , erythrocytic mycoplasmosis is also correspondingly rare ( national research council , ) ."
"clinical signs clinical signs are typically observed only if the normally latent infection is activated by immunosuppression or splenectomy ( national research council , ) .","signs are due to erythrocyte destruction and may include weight loss , hemoglobinuria , pallor , and dyspnea ."
"pathology necropsy of rats with m . haemomuris infection is unrewarding except in the case of active infections , when anemia , hemoglobinuria , and splenomegaly may be observed .",blood films are likely to show parasitemia only in active infections .
"diagnosis should be based on detection of the organisms on erythrocytes , where they appear as round ( coccoid ) , elongate ( rod ) , or dumbbell - shaped densities on the erythrocyte surface .",diagnosis m . haemomuris infection should be suspected whenever lice are found in a rat colony or whenever anemia and hemoglobinuria are observed .
"once the disease is confirmed in a colony , rederivation by embryo transfer or cesarian section is warranted , although treatment with antirickettsial compounds such as tetracyclines or arsenicals may be appropriate for small groups of rats ( ristic and kreier , ) .",prevention and control m . haemomuris infection is readily prevented by excluding polyplax spinulosa and controlling biologic materials being introduced into a colony .
"it reduces the half - life of erythrocytes , can alter function of the mononuclear phagocyte system , and can increase rejection of transplantable tumors , as well as interfering with research in other blood - borne parasitic diseases such as malaria and trypanosomiasis .",research complications m . haemomuris exerts its effects on research by virtue of its parasitism of erythrocytes .
"however , they should not be forgotten as they not only persist in wild populations and pet rodents , but there are many other regions of the bioresearch world where they may possibly persist .","as with bacteria , many of the ' classical ' viral pathogens of rats such as sendai virus are very rare ( pritchett - corning et al . , ; livingston and riley , ) ."
"the species contains strains that are antigenically homologous ( jacoby and gaertner , ) .","etiology sendai virus is an rna virus of the family paramyviridae , genus and species respirovirus ."
"sendai virus is highly contagious , with transmission occurring through the respiratory tract either by aerosol or direct contact .","epizootiology and transmission although sendai virus was once very prevalent in commercial sources of mice and rats , it is rarely seen in today ' s colonies ( pritchett - corning et al . , ; liang et al . , ; schoondermark - van de ven et al . , ; livingston and riley , ; kohl , , mcinnes et al . , ) ."
"it has been shown in lewis rats , inoculated intranasally with sendai virus , that draining lymph nodes of the upper respiratory tract are the initial and major site of antibody production .","development of serum immunoglobulin g ( igg ) antibodies coincides with clearance of respiratory tract infection and recovery from viral infection ( liang et al . , ) ."
"later , there is pronounced perivascular and peribronchial cuffing with a lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltrate that may remain months after the acute phase of the infection ( burek et al . , ; percy and barthold , ) .","based upon eerimental infection , lesion severity has been shown to be more severe in brown norway and lew rats than in f - 344 rats ( liang et al . , ; sorden and castleman , ) ."
"the multiplex fluorescent immunoassay ( mfi or mfia ; hsu et al . , ; wunderlich et al . , ) has replaced elisa as the test of choice for diagnosis of sendai virus infections in rats due to improved sensitivity and specificity and the requirement of much lower amounts of serum .","diagnosis due to the low prevalence of clinical signs , diagnosis is best achieved by detection of antibodies to the virus and demonstration of typical lesions in the respiratory tract ."
"this presumes that either all rats in the colony have been eed , as might occur where rats are housed in opentop cages , or that all further interindividual transmission is prevented , so that no new infections occur during the clearing , or ' burnout ' phase , which could perpetuate the infection .","accordingly , if antibody - naive rats are not introduced and if pregnant and preweanling rats are killed and breeding is halted , the virus will be eliminated from the colony within - 8 weeks ( jacoby and gaertner , ) ."
the antigenic differences between rcv - p and rcv - sda are significant enough to allow cross - infection with either virus .,"moreover , because these are highly mutable coronaviruses , field isolates may exhibit additional genetic and antigenic differences , but are likely capable of inducing a similar spectrum of disease ."
"differences in pathogenicity have been reported among a few rat strains ( jacoby and gaertner , ; carthew and slinger , ) .","however , the severity of lesions in reinfected rats is minimal compared with those associated with primary infections ( percy et al . , ; weir et al . , ) ."
signs include cervical swelling due to inflammation and edema of submaxillary salivary glands ( fig .,") , nasal and ocular discharges that are usually porphyrin stained , photophobia , corneal opacities , and corneal ulcers ."
"pathology the microscopic changes associated with rhinitis , tracheitis , and focal bronchitis during the acute stage of the disease include a mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cell infiltration , hyperplastic respiratory epithelia with loss of ciliated surfaces , and focal alveolitis .","the lesions within the lower respiratory tract abate in about - 10 days , and those in the nasopharynx remain somewhat longer ( percy and barthold , ) ."
"however , because the disease is often subclinical , typical signs associated with salivary gland and harderian gland tropisms may not be useful .","during outbreaks , especially prior to seroconversion , histological examination of the harderian glands and the submaxillary and parotid salivary glands may aid in diagnosis ( percy and barthold , ) and pcr of the infected glands is useful in confirmation of active infections compton and riley , ) ."
"however , in one report , this agent was prevalent in wild rats , so effective control of the latter is of paramount importance ( easterbrook et al . , ) .","control of infection within a colony or facility is based upon the fact that rats shed the virus for only about week , after which they are immune and not latently infected ."
"except for long - term ocular lesions , research complications would be eected to be linked to the period of active infection and the - to - week reparative period .",eure keratitis may also result from lack of tear production or ehthalmus associated with edema of harderian glands .
"parvoviruses that infect rats include ( kilham ' s ) rat virus ( rv ) , ( toolan ' s ) h - 1 virus , rat parvovirus ( rpv ) , and rat minute virus ( rmv ) .","in the nomenclature proposed by the international committee on tanomy of viruses , all of these viruses , plus minute virus of mice and mouse parvovirus are merged into one species , rodent protoparvovirus ."
"infection of pregnant females also results in persistent infection of progeny ; however pups of persistently infected dams are protected , presumably by maternal antibody .","if weanling rats are inoculated , the duration of viral recovery and infectivity is decreased to and weeks , respectively ( paturzo et al . , ; jacoby et al . , ) ."
"although subclinical infections in postweanling rats are the rule , an outbreak characterized by hemorrhage and necrosis of the brain , testes , and epididymides has been reported in young adult rats ( coleman et al . , ) .","the ability of rv to cross the placenta appears to depend on the virus strain , dose , and time of gestation ."
"immunocompetent adult rats mount a classic th1 immune response that results in viral clearance ( ball - goodrich et al . , ) , whereas rat virus in athymic rats induces a more severe and persistent infection than in euthymic rats ( gaertner et al . , , .",the immune status of the host is also significant to the outcome of rv infection .
"pcr assays for rv , h - 1 , rpv and rmv have also been developed that provide a rapid , specific and sensitive means for detecting viral dna in tissue ( besselsen et al . , a , b ) , feces or the environment .","ns1 - based tests thus represent a non - specific assay that provides confirmatory testing for the specific vp2 - based assays ( besselsen et al . , ; kunita et al . , ; livingston et al . , ) ."
"rat virus infection in the diabetesresistant biobreeding rat increases the eression of macrophage cytokines , leading to an autoimmune diabetes ( chung et al . , ) .","rat virus has been shown to modulate immune function through its tropism for t - cell lymphocytes ( mckisic et al . , ) ."
"isolation of the mhg virus ( mcconnell et al . , ) and subsequently a virus designated nsg910 ( ohsawa et al . , ) from rats provided further evidence of distinct rat cardioviruses .",there has long been suspicion that rats may harbor a host specific cardiovirus as evidenced by seroconversion to the closely related theiler ' s murine encephalomyelitis virus ( tmev ; genus cardiovirus and species theilovirus ) .
"no clinical signs have been associated with either eerimental inoculation or natural infection , and the virus does not spread beyond the intestinal tract .","in immunocompetent rats , rtv replicates in enterocytes of the small intestine and following eerimental inoculation , is shed for - 8 weeks ."
"in one report , a test and cull strategy was shown to be effective in eliminating the virus from a contaminated colony ( dyson , ) .","little is known about control of rtv infections , although measures employed for tmev in mice are likely effective with rtv infections ."
"the virus does not cause clinical disease , but multifocal , nonsuppurative vasculitis and interstitial pneumonitis with necrosis are prominent lesions seen in the acute phase of the disease .","pcrs are also available for detection of active infections with trachea or lungs , the sites of infection , serving as optimal samples for testing ."
"diarrhea in suckling rats has been associated with a virus in the species rotavirus b , from the genus rotavirus and family reoviridae .","the authors who first reported this disease named it ' infectious diarrhea of infant rats ' ( vonderfecht et al . , ) so it is sometimes referred to by the acronym , idir ."
"these viruses include mouse adenovirus , reovirus , parainfluenza virus , and endogenous retroviruses ( kohn and barthold , ; percy and barthold , ; national research council , ) .","there are several rodent viruses for which there is serological evidence of infection in the rat , but for which there are negligible data demonstrating any clinical or pathological importance ."
"therefore , in order for a rat colony to remain infected with t . gondii , cat feces would need to be repeatedly introduced .","as a result , t . gondii is an organism is of little current significance in research facilities , and routine monitoring for tolasmosis in rats is not commonplace ."

"diagnosis in recently killed rats is by direct examination of the bladder wall , histopathology , scanning electron microscopy , or microscopic examination of cryostat sections stained with acridine orange ( barthold , b ; cornish et al . , ) .",diagnosis trichosomoides crassicauda infestation is diagnosed in live rats by filtration of urine and then examination of the filter medium for the eggs .
"follow - up found that the infestation was not eliminated in one of rats , perhaps because of reinfection .","prevention and control treatment for t . crassicauda infestation has been reported , using a single dose of ivermectin ( summa et al . , ) ."
etiology there are only two adult cestodes that are likely to be encountered in laboratory rats : rodentolepis nana ( also often referred to as hymenolepis nana ) and hymenolepis diminuta .,"the primary differences of consequence between the two species are that r . nana is zoonotic and can have a direct life - cycle , whereas h . diminuta always has an indirect life - cycle , utilizing an intermediate host , and is not zoonotic ."
"hymenolepis diminuta is larger than h . nana , - 60 mm long and - 4 mm wide .",the scolex of h . diminuta also has four suckers but the rostellum is unarmed - it has no hooks .
"they are readily identified by the presence in the cyst of a scolex , strobila , and bladder ( hsu , ) .","the cysts are found in the livers of rats , mice , and hamsters and are up to several centimeters in diameter ."
an additional - 12 days are required before mature proglottids are formed .,"these larvae reenter the lumen , the scolex evaginates , and they attach to the mucosa ."
the life - cycle of h . diminuta is always indirect and is similar to the indirect life - cycle of r . nana .,"hymenolepis diminuta has a similar host range : mice , rats , hamsters , and primates , including humans ( hsu , ) ."
"diagnosis infection is diagnosed by detection of the adult cestodes on direct examination of the small intestine , by observation of the eggs in feces ( smear or fecal flotation ) , or by histopathologic detection of cysticercoids or adults in the small intestine ( hsu , ) .","pathology although presence of the parasites can be identified during gross examination or microscopically in tissue sections , there are no associated significant lesions ."
"prevention and control rodentolepis nana and h . diminuta infection is prevented by purchase of clean stocks of rodents , by adequate disinfection of barrier room supplies , and thorough insect control and exclusion of wild rodents ( baker , ) .","treatment of infected animals is not generally recommended , because of the zoonotic implications of this disease ."
"however , inadvertent interference of research has been not been reported likely because of the rarity of hymenolepiasis in rat research colonies .","research complications eerimentally , h . diminuta has been shown to elicit a host th2 type immune response ( mckay , ; starke and oaks , ; webb et al . , ) that may modulate models of intestinal and extraintestinal disease ( graepel et al . , ; hunter et al . , hunter et al . , , a reardon et al . , ) ."
"some are zoonotic ( hong et al . , ) , but none are significant in laboratory rats and trematodes are not even addressed in some texts ( baker , ) .","numerous trematodes have been reported in wild rats , including plagiorchis muris , p . philippinensis , and p . javensis ."
"the eggs hatch in - 8 days , and females can begin to lay eggs after another days .","epizootiology fur mites are transmitted by eggs , which can persist in the environment for long periods ."
"diagnosis a number of diagnostic methods for the detection of fur mites have been developed including fur plucks , tape tests , and skin scrapes which can be used on live animals and examination of cooled rats or pelts using a dissecting microscope ; the latter may be aided by placing the animal or pelt on a black background .","because mites or eggs may be found on different parts of the body ( metcalf pate et al . , ; ricart arbona et al . , b ) , examination of several sites is recommended ."
infestation can also be eliminated by rederivation and is readily excluded by proper adherence to modern practices of barrier room technology .,"of note , there are numerous anecdotal reports of infection recurrence , thus animals should be monitored regularly to ensure effective treatment ."
diagnosis may be achieved by direct observation of blood engorged mites on rats or in the environment .,"mites may also be found in sticky insect traps , although the latter may lack sensitivity as a sole diagnostic tool ( watson , ) ."
pediculosis is prevented by introducing only animals free of the condition .,"insecticides approved for use in veterinary medicine may be used effectively to treat infestations , as may subcutaneous administration of ivermectin ( baker , ) , but would probably be advisable only in especially valuable rats in the absence of significant intercurrent infections ."
our understanding of pneumocystosis in rats has changed significantly in the last few years .,p . carinii causes a host - specific infection ( rats only ) with two distinct diseases seen in immunodeficient vs . immunocompetent rats .
the abundant organisms in these cases are usually easily identified by special stains such as methenamine silver that demonstrate the fungal cysts within the alveoli and bronchioles .,"in addition to the foamy material comprising trophozoites , phospholipids , macrophages , and debris filling aveoli , the infection in nude rats was also noted to have interstitial and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration ."
"p . carinii has a slow doubling time , estimated at days ( aliouat et al . , ) , and does not appear to incite a host response until a population density threshold is reached .","in immunocompetent rats , lesions occur following infection , regardless of the age of the rats ."
eosinophils and / or neutrophils are occasionally present but not a useful diagnostic criterion .,"multinucleated giant cells may occasionally be present , and slight interstitial hemorrhage is common ."
rats will produce antibodies by approximately - 8 weeks after infection and will remain antibody positive for life .,screening of groups of rats for p . carinii may be accomplished by serology or by pcr .
"research complications the impact of p . carinii infection on research using immunocompetent rats has not been well - elored , although it has been a confounding factor in inhalation studies ( gilbert et al . , ) .","in addition , because of its high prevalence and the fact that it results in observable pulmonary inflammation , it might be a differential diagnosis to consider in instances where uneected pulmonary or cardiopulmonary results are observed ."
"athymic nude mice , and presumably athymic nude rats , are more susceptible to lethal infection than are euthymic animals .","encephalitozoon cuniculi has also been recovered from transplantable ascites tumors in rats ( petri , ) ."
"it is transmitted by ingestion , and possibly inhalation , of spores shed in urine ( wilson , ) .","vertical transmission has been proposed in primates , foxes , mice , rabbits , and guinea pigs but not in rats ( boot et al . , ; liu et al . , ) ."
"as with all serologic assays , positive serologic results should be confirmed by a second method or by repeating the assay on groups of animals to establish a pattern of positive results .","screening of colonies by serology is probably the most efficient method , because infected colonies normally have a high prevalence ( gannon , ) ."
"differential diagnosis the primary histopathologic differential diagnosis for e . cuniculi infection in rats is tolasmosis , which is very rare .","encephalitozoon cuniculi measures m , stains well with gram stain and poorly with hematoxylin and eosin ."
"in one report , about one - fifth of wistar rats on a - year carcinogenesis study had chronic rhinitis associated with aspergillus fumigatus ( rehm et al . , ) .",the predisposing factor in these animals was thought to be sendai virus infection ; sendai is currently very rare .
a range of - 5400 fungal spores per gram of nonautoclaved corncob bedding was found .,"six genera of fungi ( cladosporidium , acremonium , penicillium , aspergillus , fusarium , and scolobasidium ) were isolated from the samples of corncob bedding , whereas only negligible counts were isolated from hardwood bedding samples ."
"in rats , dermatomycosis may be presented clinically by patchy hair loss and scurfy or erythematous papular - pustular lesions ( weisbroth et al . , ) .","however , it has not been reported in laboratory rats for many years ."
every stock and strain of laboratory rat has been carefully selected for specific genetic traits for decades .,traits that may be desirable to one investigator may be undesirable to another .
"overt metabolic diseases such as obesity ( zucker rat ) , diabetes ( bb rat ) , and hypertension ( shr and fawn - hooded and dahl rats ) make these strains valuable models in biomedical research , whereas spontaneous appearance of the same characteristics in outbred stocks may complicate other research studies .","more subtle strain - related tendencies , such as immunologic responsiveness characteristics in brown norway and lewis rats , are eloited by researchers in particular areas of research ."
"genetic drift within a population can also be reduced by careful adherence to specific outbreeding programs , such as line breeding with systematic exchange of breeders between multiple lines .","' randomized ' breeding is an important tool used to maintain genetic heterogeneity , but this is a carefully planned process that must not be confused with a haphazard approach that simply pairs ' random ' animals ."
"an example of modification of lesion prevalence is the impact of ad libitum overfeeding on increasing the incidence of progressive renal disease ( keenan et al . , ( keenan et al . , , .",these extraneous factors can also have a major impact on the eression of underlying genetic traits .
"brown norway rats from colonies worldwide are affected , including those maintained in isolators .","affected colonies are seronegative for all known agents , and rats of other strains maintained with the brown norway rats do not develop lung lesions ."
histological changes in the walls of affected arteries include fibrinoid necrosis and muscular hypertrophy .,"it is often identified as an incidental lesion , but in a study of the disease in rats on an inbred aci background the rupture of affected arteries was identified as a potential cause of sporadic death ( cohen et al . , ) ."
"for example , feeding a powdered diet will result in an increased incidence of malocclusion .","in addition , feed qualities , aside from total levels of calories and specific nutrients , must be considered , including contaminating chemicals , microbes , and the size and hardness of pellets ."
bacterial urease production in urine - saturated zones of bedding can increase ammonia levels .,"high moisture content in bedding leads to rapid growth of bacteria , which can increase the incidence of urinary tract infections and , possibly , mastitis and skin lesions ."
"relative humidity of less than % has been linked to the poorly characterized condition known as ringtail , although there can be other factors involved ( crippa et al . , ) .","ringtail is primarily a condition of young rats , usually sucklings , characterized by the formation of prominent annular constrictions of the tail and occasionally of the digits ."
note that these recommended levels as measured m above the floor do not necessarily reflect actual light levels to which rats are eed in individual cages at various levels in racks at varying distances from light fixtures .,"light energy eure from a generating source is a distance - squared function , so the eure of animals in cages at the top levels of the rack can be greatly increased over those in the lower levels ."
group housing of rats is much less likely to result in traumatic injuries due to fighting than is seen in mice .,"ulcerative dermatitis , associated with staphylococcus aureus and self - induced trauma from scratching , has been reported ( fox et al . , ; wagner et al . , ) ."
"clinical signs occur several days after anesthesia and include lethargy , anorexia , and abdominal distension .","the most prominent dilatation occurs in the jejunum , ileum , and cecum ."
"stock - and strain - specific differences in the prevalence of some types of tumors are well documented ( boorman and everitt , ) .","however , the overall prevalence of neoplasia and that of specific tumor types may vary considerably within stocks or strains because of genetic variation , environmental influences , and differences in laboratory methodologies and diagnostic criteria ."
"overall caloric intake is also a key factor in the age of onset , rate of tumor growth , and types of tumors observed .","high protein may alter chronic progressive nephropathy ( cpn ) which can , in turn , alter the development of renal neoplasia ( seely et al . , ) ."
another environmental influence on the prevalence of tumors is the pathogen or disease status of the rats in a particular report .,"data on tumor risk can be significantly influenced by the effect that some infectious diseases may have on longevity , pre - neoplastic or neoplastic changes , and masking of small tumors ( boorman and everitt , ) ."
"the tumors may arise in mammary tissue at any point from the neck to the inguinal area , and they tend to attain a large size and become ulcerated unless surgically excised .","on gross examination , fibroadenomas are freely movable in subcutaneous tissues , circumscribed , firm , and lobulated ."
"in some reports , the prevalence of pituitary tumors is greater in female f - 344 and sprague - dawley rats .","carcinomas of the pars distalis are reported with much less frequency ; however , their reported prevalence may vary considerably because of differences in classification protocols by pathologists ."
"grossly , the tumors are soft and dark red due to prominent hemorrhagic areas .","chromophobe adenomas vary in size , often reaching cm in diameter ."
"f - 344 rats have a relatively low incidence of adrenal cortical neoplasia ; pheochromocytomas occur at a higher rate , and are observed in approximately % of males and % of females ( table . 6 ) .","for example , the range of benign pheochromocytoma , reported in all of studies included in the survey , was from % to %."
"grossly , islet cell tumors may be either single or multiple and are circumscribed and reddish brown .",islet cell carcinomas are distinguished from adenomas by capsular invasion and metastases .
"rats are susceptible to a wide variety of genetic diseases , some of which make them valuable models and others of which are confounding variables .","the incidence of such defects is obviously influenced by administration of mutagenic and teratogenic substances , but it also varies with strain , age of mother , disease status , coincidences of statistics , and human terminology ."
"interestingly , high rates of cardiac septal defects , resulting in right ventricular hypertrophy , are observed in the wistar - kyoto inbred rats used as control for the outbred spontaneous hypertensive rat ( shr ) stock ( slama et al . , ) .","overall incidence of cardiac defects has been estimated in one colony of sprague - dawley rats at % ( johnson et al . , ) ."
"selective inbreeding from such a colony resulted in the establishment of breeding lines that had a prevalence of hydrocephalus well over % ( kohn et al . , ) .","when such situations are recognized , it may be possible to intentionally further increase the prevalence through inbreeding in order to establish a strain that can serve as an animal model for the disease ."
"retinal degeneration is an age - related lesion that can be accelerated by eure to light ( lai et al . , ) .","in albino rats , the lack of a pigmented tapetum increases light eure to the retina and predisposes for the development of retinal atrophy ."
"in the testicular - feminized rat ( tfm ) , the defect is a lack of androgen receptors due to a point mutation ( yarbrough et al . , ) , although defects in other genes could potentially result in similar syndromes .","although mutant strains have been selected for this characteristic ( allison et al . , ) , it is also occasionally observed in other strains as well ."
"because of the use of rats in - year carcinogenicity studies , and as models of gerontology for humans , diseases of the geriatric rat have particular significance to the laboratory animal professional .","the type , incidence , and severity of these lesions vary greatly with stock or strain of rat , infectious disease status , eerimental manipulation , and husbandry practices , including dietary restriction ."
"however , it is not clear if dietary levels of these minerals are key determining factors in the background incidence of nephrocalcinosis .","the incidence and severity of nephrocalcinosis may be increased by several dietary manipulations , including high levels of calcium , high phosphorus , low calcium / phosphorus ratios , or low magnesium ( percy and barthold , ) ."
"as with cpn , the incidence of chronic progressive cardiomyopathy can be dramatically reduced at any age by moderate dietary restriction , i . e . , reduction of - 30% of total caloric intake relative to ad libitum overfed rats ( keenan et al . , ) .",the most commonly affected myocardial sites are the papillary muscles and interventricular septum .
"the most common change is thinning or loss of hair , especially over the back ( elwell et al . , , .",this may be observed in any stock or strain but is especially common in the brown norway rat .
"for example , in this issue of paediatrics & child health , al - mutairi and kirk ( pages - 30 ) describe the difficulty in distinguishing bacterial tracheitis from other causes of upper airway obstruction .",d istinguishing colonization from infection is an important factor in making the correct diagnosis in a wide variety of paediatric conditions .
"this differs from contamination , where the organism was never present in the site from which it has been detected , but was introduced into the specimen from another site or from contamination in the laboratory .",a carrier is a person who is colonized with an organism and may transmit the organism to other people .
"antibiotics may eradicate the strain , but they may also increase the risk of the child being colonized with a different organism that is resistant to the antibiotic that was chosen .","if a child develops an upper respiratory tract infection while colonized with s pneumoniae , h influenzae or m catarrhalis , they may develop acute otitis media or sinusitis with the colonizing strain ."
"colonization with s aureus precedes most invasive diseases caused by s aureus ( osteomyelitis , cellulitis or pneumonia ) , but such conditions are so rare that eradication could never be justified in an attempt to prevent them .",colonization of the skin and the nasophaynx can occur shortly after birth .
"traditional respiratory viruses ( adenovirus , influenza , parainfluenza virus , respiratory syncytial virus and - growth from the oropharynx / nasopharynx is of no significance , but colonization can be followed by bacteremia , which may resolve spontaneously but more commonly leads to serious invasive disease ( septic shock , meningitis , septic arthritis )",viruses and fungi can also be detected in the upper respiratory tract .
"however , one basic principle that applies to specimens obtained from all lower respiratory sites is that an organism that is seen on a gram stain is present in higher concentration than one detected only on culture ; therefore , it is more likely to be a pathogen .","also , because polymicrobial lower respiratory tract infections are rare , it is more likely that the true pathogen has been identified if there is heavy growth of a single organism than if there is mixed growth ."
a more common dilemma is whether to add empiric anaerobic coverage for respiratory tract disease .,the difficulty in detecting anaerobes means that clinicians are seldom faced with determining the significance of these isolates in respiratory tract samples .
", 4,5 most facilities are run by private prisons or county jails through lucrative ice subcontracts .",distancing and other necessary measures to prevent sars - cov - 2 from spreading are not possible in immigrant prisons .
this practice continues as does deporting potentially infected detainees to their home countries .,"arguably , it would be difficult to devise a system better suited for spreading sars - cov - 2 ."
continued imprisonment during this pandemic could result in even more severe harm to the mental health of immigrant detainees .,"for such traumatised individuals , immigration detention can cause severe psychological distress including depression and post - traumatic stress disorder ."
"moreover , the migration protection protocol ( mpp ) has created an enormous and potentially dangerous sars - cov - 2 reservoir on the us - mexican border .","last year under that policy , nearly asylum seekersincluding women and children - were forced to remain in mexico during the asylum application process , and live in unsanitary , overcrowded , makeshift encampments with no healthcare system , and violence ."
as the usa and the rest of the world attempt to stave off the worst pandemic in generations there can be no doubt that continuing to hold immigrant detainees in overcrowded facilities is not only cruel but dangerous .,"ice is not carrying out the sentence imposed by a federal judge , "" notes one former ice director ."
interferon alpha / beta ( ifn - a / b ) production by virusinfected cells represents a critical part of host ' s innate immunity .,"ifn - a / b not only induces an antiviral state in cells by activating the eression of ifn stimulated genes ( isgs ) but also modulates the subsequent development of adaptive immunity ( iwasaki and medzhitov , ; welsh et al . , ) ."
"here , we show that prrsv efficiently activates the transcription of ifn - a / b in porcine monocyte - derived dendritic cells ( mo - dc ) in a time - dependent and transient manner ; and this effect is dependent on the activation of phosphatidylinositol - kinase ( pi3k ) .","however , the exact mechanism by which prrsv inhibits the induction of ifn - a / b during infection of its natural host cells remains less well defined ."
"several recent studies have shown the role of nonstructural proteins of prrsv , especially nsp1a and nsp1b , in antagonizing the transcriptional activation of ifn - b in vitro ( beura et al . , ; chen et al . , ; kim et al . , ; song et al . , ) , but their relevance to the natural host cells such as macrophages and mo - dc remains unknown .","here , we intended to elore the mechanisms by which prrsv inhibits the induction of ifn - a / b in its natural host cells , porcine mo - dc ."
"serum samples were examined for the presence of prrsv specific antibodies using the idexx herdchek prrs x3 ab elisa ( westbrook , ma ) at the south dakota state university ' s animal disease research and diagnostic laboratory .","peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmc ) were isolated from pig peripheral blood by density centrifugation using histopaque - 1077 ( sigma inc . , st . louis , mo ) ."
it was propagated in marc - 145 cells and the supernatant of infected cells was collected and stored at c .,virus titers were determined by transferring a - fold serially diluted supernatant to marc - 145 cells and incubating for - 7 days .
the concentrations of rna were determined using a nanodrop nd - 1000 spectrometer ( thermo scientific ) .,"the same amount of rna in each treatment group was reverse transcribed into complementary dna ( cdna ) using high - capacity cdna reverse transcription kits ( applied biosystem , foster city , ca ) by following the manufacturer ' s instructions ."
"cytoplasmic extracts were prepared with nucbuster protein extraction kit ( emd bioscience , san diego , ca ) by following the manufacturer ' s instruction .","at , , , and h after infection , supernatants and cells were both collected ."
b : supernatants were collected from the same eeriments and used in a quantitative elisa to determine the production of ifn - a .,c : cell lysates from the same eeriments were prepared and used in a quantitative elisa to determine the production of ifn - a .
a similar significant reduction of ifn - a in the prrsv infected group was observed at h after infection ( p = 00004 ) .,this result suggests that virus replication is essential to the reduction of ifn - a induced by poly i .
"however , prrsv blocked the induction of ifn - a in mo - dc by as yet undefined post - transcriptional regulatory mechanisms .",abundant and a comparable level of ifn - a / b transcripts was induced by prrsv and poly i in mo - dc .
future studies will be focused on delineating the exact post - transcriptional mechanisms utilized by prrsv to block the induction of ifn - a in infected mo - dc and alveolar macrophages .,"additionally , we have provided evidence for the novel post - transcriptional regulation of ifn - a induction exerted by prrsv ."
"despite this success , major obstacles remain in developing vaccines for pathogens against which vaccines do not exist ( such as hepatitis c virus , hcv ) or against emerging pathogens ( such as severe acute respiratory syndrome , sars ) and improving suboptimal vaccines ( such as bacille calmette - guerin , bcg ) .","vaccines are considered to be one of the most significant medical interventions against infectious diseases ( hilleman , ) ."
"in addition , the early activation of innate immune components serves to create an inflammatory environment that conditions the host for effective generation of adaptive immune responses ( iwasaki and medzhitov , ) .","upon interaction with pathogens , the innate immune system provides a first line of defense and reacts within minutes to minimize the immediate threat posed by the pathogen ."
"thus memory responses , the goal of vaccination , provide both speed and specificity in the recognition and elimination of infectious agents .",memorytand b cells are activated much more rapidly compared to the initiation of primary adaptive cell responses and their antigen specificity is more focused .
targeting of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune systems is critical in achieving this goal .,the ultimate goal of natural host defense and prophylactic vaccination is to generate adaptive memory responses that are both rapid and highly focused ( figure . 1 ) .
"at the time it was known that lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) , lipotechoic acid , double - stranded ( ds ) rna , peptidoglycans , and other pathogen components could nonspecifically stimulate immune cells and that some of these components functioned as vaccine adjuvants when added to immunization regimens along with specific antigen .","innate immune response using pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) that can be engaged by pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( pamps ; janeway , ) ."
"in addition , they may lead to maturation and migration of key antigen - presenting cells ( apcs ) , such as dcs ( figure . 2 ) .",prrmediated activation of cells leads to secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines .
"toll , was shown to regulate antifungal responses ( lemaitre et al . , ) .","soon after this discovery , medzhitov cloned the first mammalian toll - like receptor ( tlr ) that was essential for lps recognition ( medzhitov et al . , ) ."
"for example , drosophilla toll has been shown to recognize microbial ligands only through its interaction with spatzle , a host protein that directly interacts with microbial components ( lemaitre et al . , ) .","similarly , mammalian tlr - 4 recognizes lps indirectly through lps binding protein ( lbp ) and the surface receptor cd14 pmsss activated iimate immune cdis ."
"dc subsets , which eress distinct arrays of tlrs , are found at strategic anatomical sites allowing them to respond rapidly to microbial invasion ( kadowaki et al . , ) .","as a consequence of this inflammatory microenvironment , monocytes that infiltrate the site can differentiate into macrophages and dcs ; the latter being crucial in priming of naive cd4 + helper as well as inducing c + t cell differentiation into killer cells ."
adjuvants can be functionally differentiated as immunopotentiators and delivery vehicles .,adjuvants historically are defined functionally as vaccine components that enhance the immunogenicity of antigen in vivo .
"intracellularly a conserved , ~ 200 amino acid cytoplasmic domain , known as tir ( tou / ill receptor domain ) , is important for its association with adaptor proteins , thus linking these transmembrane receptors to their downstream signaling pathways .",lrr domains have been suggested to form a horseshoe - like concave structure that is thought to interact with their ligands either directly or indirectly through intermediate proteins .
"as transmembrane proteins , it is possible that tlr membrane aggregation may occur through other transient structures such as lipid rafts or caveoli .",it is not known whether oligomerization of tlrs takes place and whether it is required for signaling .
"the tlr family is the single most abundant family of proteins identified to date that recognizes molecular signatures , with tlr - 1 - 11 discovered mostly based on homology searches .",ligands to these receptors were either identified with over eression of these receptors in cells lacking them ( such as human embryonic kidney ( hek ) cells ) or by using mouse strains that do not eress particular tlrs because of gene targeting or by natural mutations in tlr genes .
"in addition , tlr - 3 gene targeted mice have defective responses to viral rna , indicating that tlr - 3 is involved in viral rna recognition ( aleulou et al . , ) .","a specific blocking monoclonal antibody against tlr - 3 , as well as tlr - 3 transfectants of hek cells , demonstrated that the recognition of poly - i sequence and other dskna sequences were tlr - 3 dependent ( matsumoto et al . , ) ."
"although tlr - 4 has been established as an essential receptor for lps responsiveness , other molecules , such as cd14 , lbp , and md - 2 , have been identified in aiding lps recognition ( haziot et al . , ; shimazu et al . , ; akashi et al . , ) .","historically , mouse strains such as c3h / hej have been known to be lps hyporesponsive ; subsequent to the cloning of tlr - 4 , a mutation in tlr - 4 cytoplasmic region was found in c3h / hej mice that elained defective tlr - 4 - mediated signaling and lps hyporesponsiveness ( poltorak et al . , ; qureshi et al . , ) ."
cho cells eressing tlr - 5 were found to respond to culture supernatants from grampositive and gram - negative bacteria .,"purification of culture supernatant led to the discovery that bacterial flagellin is a tlr - 5 stimulatory component ( hayashi et al . , ) ."
"the life cycles of infectious agents in their hosts can be largely extracellular ( e . g . , many bacteria ) , or intracellular where rapid entry into cells is required for survival and continued proliferation ( e . g . , most viruses and some bacteria like mycobacterium , leishmania , and salmonella ) .","thus , optimal recognition of some ligands , such as viral rna and bacterial dna , requires intracellular receptors , whereas bacterial cell wall components , such as lps or lipoproteins , are best detected extracellularly ."
"nod2 is eressed in cells of the myeloid lineage as well as in muscosal epithelial cells ( gutierrez et al . , ) .","thus , prrs are eressed extracellularly as well as intracellularly depending on their ligands of choice ."
subsequent activation of the transcription factors nfkb and ap - 1 by traf6 involves yet other adaptor proteins known as takl and tab2 ( figure . 3 ) .,"through its n - terminal death domain my 8 binds to another family of signal transducers , known as iraks ( il - 1 receptor - associated kinase ) , which in turn bind to traf6 ."
"for discovery efforts the incredible diversity of scaffolds generated through combinatorial chemistry , the ability to target innate immune mechanisms with exceptional selectivity , and the tried and tested drug discovery engines of high - throughput screening ( hts ) and hit to lead ( htl ) optimization can now be applied to immune potentiators .","moreover , the small - molecule platform opens up new avenues for manipulating the innate immune response by providing new intracellular targets and signaling pathways ( figure ) ."
"this probably was due to temporally different peaks of research activity in adaptive and innate immunity , with the latter peaking only recently .","traditionally , efforts have been devoted in vaccine research towards identifying protective antigens rather than optimizing adjuvants able to change qualitatively the immune response ."
a general strategy of such a screening is outlined in figure libraries of diverse chemical compounds ( natural or synthetic ) can be mined for immune potentiators using high - throughput screening ( hts ) .,cell - based assays can be designed to measure general activation of innate immune cells or screens can be targeted towards specific receptors or signaling components of the innate immune system such astoll - like receptors ( tlrs ) .
"lead compounds , thus identified , may then be tested for their efficacy in eerimental vaccine formulations using established animal models and benchmarking against known immune potentiators .","the quantity and quality of immune responses can be judged using functional antibodies , cd4 + and c + t cells and protection against an infectious challenge ."
"because of this unbiased screening approach , once a compound is optimized , a thorough investigation will need to be carried out to ascertain its target and mode of action .","random screening also eliminates any prior assumptions about the mode of action , and thus it can yield compounds for which no known receptors or targets have yet been identified ."
the key challenges and opportunities will be found in linking systems biology of the immune system with our growing molecular understanding of adjuvant mechanisms ( figure . 5 ) .,we envision that the future of vaccine adjuvant research will increasingly employ the tools and platforms of modern drug discovery .
"several of these first - generation candidates ( such as cpg , mpl , and imidazoquinolines ) have shown some","thus , in academic institutions , the vaccine industry , as well as governmental agencies , research and development efforts are converging towards developing next - generation adjuvants ."
"as has been true for most governmental / noncivilian investments in emerging technologies , a byproduct of national security research is usually of use for nongovernmental purposes .",governmental agencies have a direct stake in the eloration of novel immune potentiators in this national security area .
"although there is a heightened acceptance , both by regulatory agencies as well as commercial vaccine manufacturers that improved vaccine adjuvants are needed to meet challenges of the future infectious diseases , there is a skepticism due to new technology carrying unknown risks that are still unevaluated .","at present , the safety and regulatory hurdles that will be encountered with the addition of novel immune potentiators and delivery systems to final vaccine formulations may be significant and are still largely ill defined ."
"in addition , the growing number of immune potentiators , targeting diverse innate immune mechanisms , should allow for the identification of candidates with improved therapeutic indices .",it is likely that improved formulation and controlled release of potent immune potentiators will limit toxicities while increasing efficacy .
"infected chickens develop respiratory symptoms , coughing , sneezing , depression , nasal discharge , kidney , gonads , reduced egg production , poor egg quality and death .","ibv has a large number of genotypes and in china , strains are isolated during - 2012 ."
post infection of ibvs can encode mirnas or influence the eression levels of cellular mirnas .,"mirnas have been reported to play an important role in virus pathogenesis such as mir - 122 , which may be able to stabilize the hcv genomic rna , and the immune response related mirnas such as mir - 1 3 0 a , mir - 155 , mir - 2 3 b mir - 1 4 6 a - 5 p which can help the virus to augment its replication or in evasion of cellular immune response ."
differentially eressed mirnas are considered responsible for the differentially eressed ( de ) mrnas .,"as we described several of these mirnas are in accordance with the virus titers in each group , revealing that they may serve as determinants of the pathogenicity of nephropathogenic ibvs ."
"mir - 1 4 6 a - 5 p is well known immune response gene , overeression of mir - 1 4 6 a - 5 p leads to the suppression of cellular inflammatory response and decrease in cytokine secretion .","fortunately , we found the level of mir - 1 4 6 a - 5 p is related to the replication of ibv at the early stage of infection ."
"the ldt3 - a , sck2 and scdy2 were nephropathogenic ibv strains and stored by the animal disease prevention and food safety key laboratory of sichuan province .","the ibv strain beaudette was kindly provided by prof . ding - xiang liu , nanyang technological university ."
"the cell lines were then inoculated with beaudette at , 242 tcid50 , hd11 and 53 tcid50 , vero and incubated at c ( 5% co ) for h . subsequently , the cells were washed with pbs and cultured in c incubator with dmem supplemented with % fbs ( 5% co ) for h . total rna of each well was isolated by trizol reagent ( invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer ' s protocol , and reverse transcript by mirna specific rt primers ( ribobio ) .",hd11 and vero cells were seeded at a density of - 70% per well in - well plates .
"h after transfection , cells were incubated with beaudette at , 242 tcid , incubated for h at c ( 5% co ) .",the cells were washed with pbs and cultured in c incubator with dmem supplemented with % fbs ( 5% co ) for h . virus titers and mirna levels were detected by realtime pcr .
the cytopathic time of each group was observed by inverted microscope .,"transcription levels of the predicted genes were amplified by primers ( supplementary table ) and detected by sybrgreenii ( takara , china ) ."
"the genes containing the predicted - utr binding sites ( tnfrsf18 and irak2 ) were amplified by primerstar gxl dna polymerase ( takara ) , and cloned into pmirglo at the downstream multiple cloning site of luc2 ( primers are listed in supplementary table ) .",pmirglo vector was utilized to analyze the binding activities of mir - 1 4 6 a - 5 p to the predicted sites in the - utr of each gene .
the constructed plasmids were transfected or co - transfected with mirna mimics or inhibitors into hek t cells using lipofectamine ( invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer ' s instruction .,hek t cells were cultured in - well plates at a density of - 70% .
data from each independent eeriment was shown as mean value with standard deviation .,all the transfection eeriments and rt - qpcr eeriments were performed in triplicate .
mirna and mrna sequencing analysis in chicken kidney tissues infected with ibv results showed that the eression levels of several mirnas were in consistent with the virus titers and lesions in chicken kidney .,micrornas have been reported to involve in the virus infection .
it was found that the high level of mir - 1 4 6 a - 5 p could promote the replication of beaudette in hd11 cells ( fig .,"to determine the role of these mir - 1454 , mir - 3538 , mir - 1 4 6 a - 5 p , mir - 215 - 5 p in the lifecycle of ibv infected cells , we examined these mirnas role in replication of virus in hd11 cells ."
transcriptome and target gene analysis results displayed related genes which may be regulated by mir - 1 4 6 a .,"by annotation , predicted target genes ( irak2 , lrp2 , elk4 , tapbpl , tnfrsf18 , tgfbi , ccl19 , mvb12b ) were involved in regulation of immune responses and cell apoptosis , which may be related to the multiplication of ibv ."
"a study of differences of dynamic distribution between nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus ( ibv ) strains such as saibk , m41 and h120 in spf chicken exhibited that the kidney and the lung were the most sensitive organs in ibv infection .",our in vitro study results exhibited that the mir - 1 4 6 a - 5 p was associated with the rapid multiplication of virus at the early stage of infection by down regulating the tnfrsf18 and irak2 .
"on the other hand , the virus can change the eression level of cellular mirnas , which may be beneficial to viral infection .",these binding sites have been exhibited the increasing stability and translation of the viral rna .
"in addition , for the first time it was found that tnfrsf18 was a target of mir - 1 4 6 a .","however , the eression level of tnfrsf18 was relatively low , the function of tnfrsf18 is need to be further characterization ."
"further , the protein - protein interaction ( ppi ) analysis showed that the up - regulated immune response associated genes were mainly enriched in tlr3 pathway , and resulting in the up - regulation of il15 .",transcriptome sequencing analysis results exhibited that the nf - b1a and nf - b1z were up - regulated .
"furthermore , a new protocol needs to be launched to rapidly evaluate the effects of unproven antiviral drugs and vaccine to fasten the clinical application of new drugs .","as a newly emerging virus , many questions are not fully answered , including the exact mode of transmission chain , geographical distribution , and animal origins ."
"contains a cap structure along with a poly ( a ) tail and comprises four main structural proteins , namely , spike ( s ) , membrane ( m ) , envelope ( e ) , and nucleocapsid ( n ) proteins ; all these proteins are encoded within the end of the viral genome .","in this review , we summarize the recent findings in the field of mers - cov , especially its molecular virology , interspecies mechanism , clinical features , and antiviral therapies , as well as our speculations ."
"serologic studies have shown the presence of cross - reactive antibodies to mers - cov in dromedary camels in oman , qatar , and mongolia .",live mers - cov was isolated directly from infected camels and confirmed in camel - to - human transmission .
"however , no evidence of other intermediate hosts was found mediating mers transmission from camels to humans .","we speculated whether mers - cov was transmitted similarly , given the evidence that mers - cov replicated in cell lines of other animals , including goat , pig , rabbit , horse , and civet ."
"however , an infectious virus was not isolated directly from bats .","the transmission from bats is supported by the following evidence : mers - cov is phylogenetically and closely related to tylonycteris bat cov hku4 ( ty - batcov - hku4 ) and pipistrellus bat cov hku5 ( pi - batcov - hku5 ) , which were discovered in tylonycteris pachypus and pipistrellus abramus , respectively , in hong kong in , revealing the mers - cov genomic origins in bats ; the mers - cov receptor is also the receptor for hku4 but not hku5 , hence showing functional identity ; and viral gene fragments identical or quite similar to those of mers - cov have also been recovered in bats ."
dpp4 contributes critically to our understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of this newly emerging human coronavirus and may facilitate the development of antiviral therapies and vaccines .,patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis demonstrate increased dpp4 immunostaining in alveolar epithelia and alveolar macrophages .
majority of the mers patients are elderly males with median age of years .,"a study involving patients showed an increase in casefatality rates with age , from % ( seven of ) in those younger than years , to % ( 13 of ) in the group aged under years , and % ( 15 of ) in patients aged years or older ."
"the possible factors contributing to the common presentation of acute renal failure in mers patients include increased number of chronic renal diseases in mers patients , with progressive respiratory failure ; and direct renal injury ; dpp4 is present in the renal cells , and mers - cov was detected in urine .","without a travel history , linking the patient to the arabian peninsula , or a known mers case , few clinical and radiological features can reliably differentiate mers from acute pneumonia caused by other microbial agents ."
"the sars "" viral load "" in upper respiratory tract secretions was low in the first days of illness , and then increased progressively , peaking early in the second week .",the viable virus can shed through respiratory secretion from clinically fully recovered patients .
"the other drugs , including lopinavir and chloroquine , still remain in the in vitro stage .","therefore , a low dosage may be effective without inducing significant immunosuppression , but this assumption warrants further preclinical evaluation in animal studies ."
"one of the antibodies , m336 , neutralizes the virus with exceptional potency and therefore represents a potential drug and vaccine candidate .","hr2p , a synthetic peptide derived from the hr2 domain of mers - cov spike protein , specifically binds to the hr1 domain of the viral spike protein and blocks viral fusion , resulting in the inhibition of mers - cov replication and its spike protein - mediated cell fusion ."
"first , well - designed large - scale case - control studies are needed to define the transmission chain of mers - cov and to enable appropriate intervention by the government .","second , retrospective serum antibody detection should be continued to define its true distribution in humans and animals ."
we here review viral infections in mice and humans with genetic defects in the il - 12 / il - 23 - ifn - axis .,"a comparison of the phenotypes observed in ko mice and deficient patients suggests that the human il - 12 / il - 23 - ifn - axis plays a redundant role in immunity to most viruses , whereas its mouse counterparts play a more important role against several viruses ."
"humans with absent ( or diminished ) response to or impaired production of ifn - caused by nonfunctional or dysfunctional components of ifn - and il - 12 / il - 23 signaling [ the binding or signaling chains of the ifn - receptor ( ifn - r1 and ifn - r2 ) , the signal transducer and activator of transcription ( stat1 ) , the p40 subunit of il - 12 and il - 23 ( il - 1 2 p40 ) , the subunit of the il - 12 and il - 23 receptor ( il - 1 2 r ) ] are highly vulnerable to infections due to nontuberculous mycobacteria ( ntm ) or vaccine - associated bacille calmette - gu rin ( bcg ) , and to a lesser extent to salmonella and a few other intracellular bacteria .","in contrast , mice whose genes encoding components of the ifn - and il - 12 / il - 23 signaling pathways are knock - out ( ko ) are vulnerable to infection by a broad spectrum of microorganisms , including intracellular bacteria and viruses ."
"although viruses are the prototype of "" intracellular "" parasites , severe viral infection has been reported in only four patients genetically deficient for ifn - receptor .","the discrepancies between the clinical phenotypes of patients and of mice deficient for ifn - and il - 12 / il - 23 signaling pathway components prompted us to compare the viral susceptibility / resistance of patients with ifn - r1 and ifn - r2 , stat1 , il - 1 2 p40 and il - 1 2 r [ 4 , mutations with the outcome of eerimental viral infection in mice deficient for ifn - , ifn - r1 , il - 1 2 p40 or il - 1 2 r , or treated with antibodies neutralizing ifn - or il - 12 so as to provide a clearer picture of the impact of the absence of ifn - and il - 12 / il - 23 signaling on viral infection in humans and mice ."
"natural infections with "" common "" ( arbitrarily defined as - 98% of humans seropositive at years ) or "" rare "" ( arbitrarily defined as less than % seropositive at years ) dna and rna viruses were considered in patients deficient for ifn - - and il - 12 / il - 23 - mediated immunity .",their table common dna virus infection in the absence of ifn - - or il - 12 / il - 23 - mediated immunity in humans and mice e an apparently normal immune defense refers to a comparable disease or in vitro response between mice with or without impaired ifn - or il - 1 2 and il - 23 - mediated response .
"no clinical manifestations due to human adenovirus ( hav ) , human herpes virus ( hhv6 ) , parvovirus b19 , molluscum contagiosum virus ( mcv ) and human papilloma virus ( hpv ) infections were reported ( table ) .",natural infection with human tropic dna viruses was considered in deficient patients ( table ) .
"wild - type , gko and ag cleared infectious virus from the lungs days after - herpesvirus ( - hv68 ) infection , a specific mouse tropic dna virus which is a good model for study of - herpesvirus ( hhv6 and ebv ) pathogenesis .","however , gko mice died weeks to months after - hv68 infection from severe large - vessel arteritis or developed multiorgan fibrosis ."
natural infection with human tropic rna viruses was considered in deficient patients ( ( table ) .,"by contrast , although positive serology for parainfluenza virus ( piv ) and respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) have been reported in deficient patients , clinical manifestations of piv and rsv infections were reported in only one child with complete ifngr1 deficiency ."
"similarly , gko mice were resistant to inoculation of rotavirus .",gko mice as well as anti - ifn - and il - 12 mab - treated mice are resistant to iv infection ( table ) .
resistant gko mice display severe encephalomyelitis with extensive primary demyelination and virus persistence following infection with theiler ' s murine encephalomyelitis virus ( tv ) .,"administration of neutralizing ab to ifn - , but not to il - 12 , increased tv - induced demyelination in susceptible mice and completely abrogated resistance in resistant mice ."
"since no infections by vaccinia virus ( vv ) , encephalomyocarditis virus ( emcv ) , vescicular stomatitis virus ( vsv ) , semliki forest virus ( sfv ) , sindbis virus ( sv ) , equine arteritis virus ( eav ) , yellow fever ( yf ) , west nile virus ( wnv ) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ( lcmv ) were reported , the vulnerability of deficient patients to these viruses remains unknown ( table ) .","the same unknown status was assigned for human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) infection since neither clinical cases nor seropositivity for hiv ag were reported in deficient patients , even though increased susceptibility to hiv replication of t cells from two ifn - r1 and one il - 1 2 r deficient patient was observed in vitro ( table and ) ."
"by contrast , wild - type , gko , ko , and anti - ifn - ab - treated mice were equally infected by vsv , despite the fact that ifn - engineered to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum mediates in vitro vsv resistance in murine fibroblasts .","following sfv infection ko mice showed an enhanced virus replication and pathology in the brain , whereas gko mice were unaffected ."
and anti - ifn - ab - treated mice become more susceptible or succumb to lcmv infection .,"genetic backgrounds were : ifn - ko mice : balb / c ; c57bl / 6 ; ifn - r1ko mice : / sv / e [ 112 , , , , ; balb / c ; anti - ifn antibody - treated mice : balb / c ; c57bl / 6 ; / sv / e ; cba / ht ; il - 1 2 p40ko mice : c57bl / 6 ; anti - il - 12 - antibody treated mice : balb / c ."
murine aids ( maids ) is induced by lp - bm5 murine leukemia retrovirus ( mulv ) in susceptible mice .,"after lp - bm5 infection , gko mice displayed accelerated neurodegeneration and the therapeutic effect of il - 12 on mice with maids was absent in gko and anti - ifn - mab - treated mice ."
"in patients with deficiencies in the ifn - - and il - 12 / il - 23 - mediated immunity , viral illness may be favored by previous mycobacterial disease , which results in poor clinical status and low cd4 counts .",viral infections in humans are associated with primary immunodeficiency diseases or are idiopathic .
"four phenotypes were assigned to deficient patients to define their vulnerability to natural infections : normal ( absence of clinical cases , with positive serology or no serological data ) , moderate ( clinical cases , with positive serology or no serological data ) , high ( occurrence of severe or lethal cases with positive serology or no serological data ) and unknown ( absence of clinical cases reported with no positive serology or no serological data ) .","three phenotypes were assigned to ko mice to define their vulnerability to eerimental viral infection : normal ( enhanced morbidity or mortality ) , moderate ( enhanced subclinical infection or enhanced mortality or morbidity in gko or ko mice only ) , and high ( enhanced mortality or morbidity in both gko and ko ) ."
"in both settings , the il - 12 / il - 23 - ifn - axis is required for protection against hsv , but not hav .","for common dna viruses , the vulnerability of deficient patients is moderate to hsv and vzv , and high to hcmv and hhv8 , whereas that of deficient mice is moderate to - mhv68 and high to hsv and mcmv ."
"for natural infections only , it is required for protection against piv , but not mumps virus , measles virus , coronavirus , reovirus , hav and rubella virus .","in both settings , the il - 12 / il - 23 - ifn - axis is required for protection against rsv , but not iv , rotavirus and enterovirus ."
"for these viruses the vulnerability of deficient mice is moderate to svf , lcmv , fv and lp - bm5 and high to vv , ev , wnv and emcv .","due to the absence of clinical cases and / or negative serological data , the vulnerability of deficient patients to rare viruses is unknown ."
the vulnerability of natural and eerimental infection with rare viruses cannot be compared .,the vulnerability of mice to rare viruses and common viruses is much the same ( 58% versus %) .
"this indicates that non - ifn - and non - il - 12 / il - 23 mechanisms are certainly involved in the control of viral infections , particularly natural infections .","in natural infections , this redundancy is much more pronounced , since deficient patients display modest vulnerability to about % of common viruses ."
"il - 12 and il - 23 receptor complexes share a common il - 1 2 r subunit , yet they comprise unique il - 1 2 r and a specific il - 2 3 r component .","il - 12 and il - 23 share a common p40 subunit , yet they comprise unique p35 and p19 subunits , respectively ."
"these data indicate that human ifn / plays a pivotal role for immunological control of hsv , and probably other viruses in vivo .","for natural infection , while patients with a heterozygous stat1 mutation that impairs ifn - , but not ifn / - mediated activation , are susceptible only to mycobacterial disease , two patients with a heterozygous stat1 mutation that impairs both ifn - and ifn / - mediated activation suffered from mycobacterial disease but , unlike patients with ifn - r deficiency , died of disseminated hsv - 1 infection with recurrent encephalitis ."
"since these processes are crucial for maintaining cellular proteostasis , it is inevitable that failures in them , which , among other things , can be caused by absence or disruption of any of their machine components , may result in disease .","at present , the precise roles of these proteins in disease are not well understood ."
large proteins often reach their native folded state via a number of intermediate states .,there are many scenarios in which hydrophobic areas of proteins become aberrantly eed to the aqueous cell cytoplasm .
"the more complex the protein , the higher the chance it will misfold .","during these folding pathways there is the potential for protein misfolding , which can result in additional deleterious functions that can lead to a range of diseases ( hartl & hayer - hartl , ) ."
"the specific localization of ta proteins within membranes is crucial to their task and , while their functions vary greatly , they are united in a common topology , based on the positioning of their single transmembrane helix ( kalbfleisch , cambon , & wattenberg , ) .","they therefore have critical roles in cell biology in membrane biogenesis , apoptosis , and protein degradation among many others ."
"to trc40 facilitating their post - translational integration into the er by means of the transmembrane proteins wrb and caml ( vilardi , stephan , clancy , janshoff , & schwappach , ) .","furthermore , sgta has been implicated in hormone receptor signaling and has been associated with viral lifecycles ( philp et al . , ) ."
"a major known function of sgta is to aid in determining the fate of secretory and membrane proteins that have mislocalized to the cytosol ( leznicki et al . , ) .","the focus of the first section of this chapter will be the molecular co - chaperone known as the small glutamine - rich tetratricopeptide repeatcontaining protein alpha ( sgta ) ( wunderley , leznicki , payapilly , & high , ) ."
"sgta belongs to a family of co - chaperones that are categorized with a "" npr "" nomenclature system .","the "" n "" represents the varying number of residues in a single repeat , and thus sgta belongs to the canonical pr motif as each repeat , made of helices , consists of amino acids ; tetratrico means in greek ."
"the n - terminal domain of sgta forms a tight dimer with a negatively charged patch on its surface which has been shown to bind with positively charged ubl domains from both bag6 and ubl4a domain through electrostatic interactions ( darby et al . , ) .","the trade - off between binding ability of sgta and these two ubls is thought to be behind the sorting mechanism of the protein quality control network ( darby et al . , ; shao et al . , ) ."
"the tpr domain is responsible for sgta binding to hsp70 and hsp90 , along with other varying receptors and proteins ( philp et al . , ; roberts et al . , ) .","due to this , the tpr domain has been linked with sgta ' s role in diseases such as hiv ( dutta & tan , ) and the parvovirus ( cziepluch et al . , ) ."
"the c - terminal domain has also been found to transiently dimerize , probably around hydrophobic substrates in the manner of a pair of tweezers ( martinez - lumbreras et al . , ) .","very recently another important motif has been identified in the c - terminus called the nnp motif consisting of three copies of asparagine - asparagineproline ( martinez - lumbreras et al . , ) ."
"studies have suggested that while bag6 promotes the polyubiquitylation of mislocalized hydrophobic substrates , sgta can antagonize this process by activating substrate deubiquitylation ( leznicki & high , ) .","both complexes also play a role in the erad pathway for irregular proteins ( xu et al . , ) ."
"without the presence of sgta , not only would the lifespan of potentially dangerous proteins be extended , but undesirable interactions between proteins and the cytosol could lead to aggregation , a suggested cause of some neurodegenerative diseases ( chakrabarti & hegde , ; wunderley et al . , ) .","overall sgta plays an important role in cytosolic quality control ; at the er it encourages the biogenesis of certain hydrophobic precursors while additionally promoting the removal of irregular and misfolded proteins ( shao et al . , ) ."
"interestingly , both increased and decreased eression of sgta can lead to the formation of aggregates which has been correlated with potentially fatal neurodegenerative diseases ( wunderley et al . , ) .","another example is alzheimer ' s disease , which is shown to be caused by two types of protein aggregates : extracellular and intracellular ( cox et al . , ) ."
"ars play an important role in locations such as the prostate gland ; although their primary role in this organ is found during the growth of the gland , they still function after maturity ( brooke & bevan , ) .","located in the cytoplasm , upon binding of the ligand to the ar , interactions take place within its n - and c - terminal domains that result in activation and transfer to the nucleus to activate transcription of specific genes ( cutress et al . , ) ."
"the same study also suggests a link between sgta and other shrs , the glucocorticoid and progesterone receptor activity suggesting that sgta ' s role in hormone signaling extends beyond the androgen receptors ( paul et al . , ) .","this links into its role in cytosolic quality control which supports this theory ( wunderley et al . , ) ."
"this form of the cancer is normally treated with androgen ablation and while most tumors respond to this treatment , some evolve into the androgen independent form which has been largely considered incurable ( cattrini et al . , ) .","androgen independent cancer evolves from genetic mutations within the cell that allow it to grow independent of ar activity ; instead it follows pathways involving overeression of bcl2 or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes among many others ( brooke & bevan , ; cattrini et al . , ) ."
"one such cause of androgen independent prostate cancer has been linked to sgta ; it has been suggested that sgta is a negative regulator of ar transport into the nucleus by promoting ar retention within the cytoplasm , as previously stated ( kato et al . , ) .","one theory as to the mechanism behind this involves hsp70 , which is suggested to provide the energy needed by chaperones that are responsible for association and dissociation of proteins ."
"while there is still much debate as to the cause of pcos , with suggestions such as improper insulin signaling , genetic mutations and irregular androgen signaling ; most patients present with hyperandrogenism ( goodarzi et al . , ) .","common symptoms include infertility , insulin resistance , obesity and high cardiovascular risk factors ( azziz et al . , ) ."
"overeression of sgta is implied to inhibit ar function by causing said retention in the cytoplasm , whereas knockdown of sgta is said to result in increased ar activity and promiscuous activation of the receptor by ligands other than testosterone , such as progesterone ( buchanan et al . , ; goodarzi et al . , ) .","asides from affecting androgen signaling , sgta has been linked to pcos via its role in apoptosis , promoting cell death when both over - and under - eressed ( yin et al . , ) ."
"another disease linked to androgen signaling is breast cancer , one of the most common cancers among women .","a study ( zhu et al . , ) first examined the relationship between sgta and breast cancer cells and found that sgta was overeressed in breast cancer cells compared to normal tissue ."
the importance of sgta within the cell cycle is another likely contributor to its role in tumorigenesis .,"the role of sgta is also linked to that of hsp90s ( highly eressed protein chaperones that assist in protein degradation ) , suggesting that while they usually bind in the cytoplasm , during cell apoptosis sgta dissociates and then accumulates in the nucleus , although much more research is needed to suggest how this further links to apoptosis ( yin et al . , ) ."
a link is suggested between sgta and the chemoresistance of nsclc cells by sgta suppressing cisplatin - induced apoptosis .,there is a known relationship between nsclc and sgta eression ; sgta is positively correlated with cellular proliferation and was frequently highly eressed in nsclc cells .
"one study suggested sgta contributed to the malignant progression of escc and thus could be used a prognostic biomarker ( yang et al . , ) .","much like the nsclc study , overeression of sgta was shown to play a role in the development and progression of tumors , although more research is still needed to decipher the mechanisms behind these observations to further understand sgta ' s role ( yang et al . , ) ."
"it was suggested that in the absence of vpu , overeression of sgta leads to interactions with hiv - 1 gag , another hiv - 1 protein , and the resulting complex inhibits hiv - 1 release .","however , in the presence of vpu stable interactions form between sgta and vpu that prevent sgta - gag interactions ( waheed et al . , ) ."
"another viral protein interacting with sgta is protein a from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) , a member of the coronaviridae family , the largest known rna viruses ( fielding et al . , ; philp et al . , ) .","sgta is thought to play a role in virus assembly or release from the cell but more research is needed to fully understand the implications of sgta ' s involvement with sars - cov and the mechanisms behind this ( fielding et al . , ) ."
"after this sv40 has to exit through the er membrane and cross the cytosol to reach the nucleus where it subsequently activates transcription and replication of the viral genome ; thus cellular transformation is caused ( wiethoff et al . , ) .",endocytosis then brings sv40 molecules complexed with lipid rafts into the cell where they proceed through endosomes before reaching the er .
first it linked the tpr domain ' s ability to interact with hsc70 ; this aids penetration of the er membrane and subsequent transport to the cytosol .,"then it linked the n - terminal domain with the infection of sv40 into the nucleus ; although the exact role the n - terminal plays is uncertain , results showed that the n - terminal was crucial for further infection after sv40 has entered the cytosol ."
the highly conserved bag6 protein is flanked by a ubiquitin - like ( ubl ) domain on the n - terminus and a bag domain on the c - terminus .,"the central region consists of a disordered proline - rich region , zinc - finger like and nuclear localization signal ( nls ) domain ."
"numerous other functions associated with bag6 have been identified , including the regulation of apoptosis , t - cell response and protein homeostasis ( kuwabara et al . , ; lee & ye , ) .",this suggests a potential function in spermatogenesis and brain development respectively .
an overview of bag6 functions and its association with disease are given in the following sections .,"therefore , dysfunctions in the bag6 complex cause various cellular abnormalities which lead to both physiological and pathological diseases ( lee & ye , ) ."
the small sections of bag6 whose structures have been solved are shown in fig .,"the primary sequence of bag6 can be subdivided into three distinct domains : the n - terminal ubl - containing region spanning amino acids - 474 ; a central proline - rich domain constituting amino acids - 1029 , a possible site for binding of hydrophobic substrates according to in vitro and in vivo studies ( leznicki et al . , ) ; and a c - terminal nls and designated unconventional bag domain constituting amino acids - 1132 ."
further eerimental evidence showed an e3 ubiquitin ligase needed to interact with eci1 to permit the degradation of er substrates .,this was eerimentally found in in vitro eeriments whereby absence of eci1 failed to successfully ubiquitinate mislocalized proteins .
"therefore , collectively , the ublcontaining domain is capable of directly recognizing and binding hydrophobic substrates ( kawahara , minami , & yokota , ) .",further structural understanding is required to gain a mechanistic understanding of substrate binding to the ubl domain .
it is involved in direct interaction with the molecular chaperone family hsp70 / hsc70 via the atpase domain .,"mechanistically , the interaction between hsp70 and c - terminal bag domain commences with hsp70 in an adp - bound state possessing a vacant nucleotide binding domain ."
"in vivo binding assays have revealed the co - precipitation of the bag6 and hsp70 , reinforcing that bag6 is a hsp70 - binding motif .","however , differences in the residual interaction between the bag domain and hsp70 across the six members of bag proteins rationalizes why in vivo studies showed reduced affinity of bag6 to hsp70 ( thress , henzel , shillinglaw , & kornbluth , ) ."
"bag6 behaves as a special transporter which eloits its "" holdase "" activity to sort aggregation prone substrates depositing them into their desired functional system .","this suggests that bag6 exhibits critical chaperoning characteristics , supported by studies which shows preferential binding of hydrophobic tail - anchored proteins via the tmd which allows sufficient time frame for the fate of polypeptides to be decided ( slavotinek & biesecker , ) ."
bag6 variants lacking the nls due to alternative splicing have shown preferential localization at the cytosol .,"although bag6 is primarily localized in the cytosol , the nls domain indicates that its presence in the nucleus is important too , and functions of bag6 as a quality control site have been displayed in both localities ( mock et al . , ) ."
this concludes that functional bag6 has a direct effect on regulating developmental defects .,"an example of unregulated apoptosis causing health defects is in mice , whereby because of in vivo genetic ablation of bag6 , embryonic lethality is caused due to amplified levels of apoptosis and cell proliferation ( desmots , russell , lee , boyd , & mckinnon , ) ."
"moreover , bag6 is deemed compulsory for the operation of reaperinduced apoptosis .","this is deduced from cases of depleted endogenous bag6 whereby the caspase activation of reaper is hindered suggesting the need of functional bag6 to act as an anti - apoptotic regulator ( thress et al . , ) ."
"for that reason , during development , bag6 is proposed to play ambiguous yet case - dependent roles .",several studies support this hypothesis whereby the absence of the gene encoding bag6 in mice resulted in neonatal lethality due to extensive abnormal apoptosis .
"other independent studies demonstrate that slight undereression of bag6 causes mitotic and g1 / s phase arrest in mislocalized chromosomes and in mammalian in vitro cells respectively , as well as enhanced apoptotic activity in hct116 cells , thus contributing negatively to health conditions ( kawahara et al . , ) .",this portrays the differential roles of bag6 in precise cellular contexts as well as its contribution to cells with varying cellular levels .
"importantly , bag6 associates itself with nascent polypeptides and evidence supports this eerimentally as , on co - treatment of eukaryotic cells with protein synthesis inhibitor , polyubiquitinated associated bag6 proteins disappeared ( minami et al . , ) .",there are three common pathways coupled to bag6 to maintain quality control within the cytoplasm upon recognizing eed hydrophobic regions of polypeptides .
"when membrane protein insertion fails , bag6 triages uninserted substrates to the degradation pathway via the proteasome upon being ubiquitinated or attempts are made to correctly refold the protein and for reinsertion in the er .","furthermore , during degradation deficiency , a ubiquitin - positive aggresome forms and bag6 along with the hydrophobic substrates deposits into an aggregate ( kawahara et al . , ) ."
bag6 associates with several protein binding partners when carrying out quality control functions .,the breakdown of bag6 anatomy found the n - terminal ubl domain to be associated with the ubiquitin proteasome system ( ups ) .
it was eerimentally deduced that bag6 heterotrimeric complex is involved in the direct interaction of the proteasome - bound substrate whereby bag6 plays a key role in the interaction .,"this targets the substrates to the proteasome where it undergoes degradation ( lee & ye , ) ."
initial studies proposed bag6 to be a protein associated with the proteasome .,"however , newer research via ms analysis elucidated extremely high sequence similarity between the s proteasome subunits and bag6 immunoprecipitates as well as bag6 ' s collaboration with interferon - ( ifn - ) - induced immunoproteasomes , which are typically favored due to their ability to produce peptides satisfactory to mhc class i molecules ( minami et al . , ) ."
issues associated with mlps are that their hydrophobic region is eed to the aqueous cytosolic environment ; thus they are inclined to form aggregates .,this poses challenges for cells eeriencing er - stress as membrane integration efficiency is further reduced .
an atpase associated multiprotein complex then extracts the ubiquitinated protein from the membrane and bag6 is recruited .,this suggests preferential chaperoning activity of bag6 as opposed to the assisting multiprotein complex which shuttles the substrates to the proteasome for degradation .
"notably , some polyubiquitin conjugates remain which can potentially form aggregates , and thus become unaffected by proteasome degradation as a result of its inhibitory effect ( wang , whynot , et al . , ) .",this concludes that the absence of bag6 prevents its detrimental role in maintaining client erad protein solubility and escorting of substrates to the proteasome for degradation .
"although bag6 can independently maintain retro - translocated substrates in a soluble , unfolded state , undereression of its heterotrimeric complex counterparts trc35 and ubl4a allowed erad substrates to remain stabilized .",this exemplifies the strong inhibitory effect of absent bag6 on erad degradation .
"notably , the bag domain of bag6 is necessary and can bind ubl4a self - sufficiently which plays a pivotal role in the correct assembly of ta proteins ( kuwabara et al . , ) .","to successfully achieve protein homeostasis through er - associated degradation and mislocalized protein pathways , the formation of the bag6 complex with trc35 and ubl4a is vital ."
"across the dimer , several key hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions were observed playing a vital role in its strong binding character .",the secondary structure reveals overlapping of three - helices from each domain .
"however , double and triple substitution abolished the interaction altogether , particularly simultaneous val - 1068 and leu - 1086 , establishing these residues as the most critical for the bag6 - ubl4a interaction .","fascinatingly , out of the four interactions illustrated , point mutations on ubl4a his - 106 and phe - 107 significantly lowered the binding affinity of the bag6 - ubl4a complex indicating the importance of both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions in stabilizing the dimer ."
bag6 - derlin2 interaction facilitates the recruitment of bag6 to the mislocalized protein site as well as retrotranslocation of substrates back to the cytosol .,"importantly , bag6 is also essential during the er exit of substrates and in the prevention of hydrophobic domains forming a blockade wang , whynot , et al . , ) ."
"however , it is likely that this review will barely scratch the surface of future disease implications of bag6 that remain to be discovered and understood .",several roles of bag6 in disease have already been identified and will be discussed below .
"extensive studies into the primary role of bag6 localized in human testes have been implicated to protect hsp2a from polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation , thereby maintaining its stability in germ cells .",it has been established that hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions govern the binding between bag6 and hsp2a .
"recent studies have revealed hsp2a as a regulator of zona pellucidareceptor complex whereby in infertile male subjects , this complex formation is perturbed due to a lack of hsp2a eression due to a knock - on effect from the lack of bag6 .","ultimately , bag6 plays a role in male infertility by stabilizing hsp2a by a similar manner of hsp70 - bag6 interaction mechanism ."
"the genotype and alleles of bag6 are prognostic for non - small cell lung cancer in norwegian - croatian subjects , as implicated by logistic regression analyses .","it was observed that the c allele of bag6 rs3117582 snp posed a gene - dosage increased risk of lung cancer whereby subjects carrying a single c allele had fold increased risk and an even greater - fold risk for subjects carrying two c alleles ( etokebe et al . , ; rosenberger et al . , ) ."
"typically , mutations in the promoter - region of genes have an impact on eression and when the specific rs3117582 snp is situated in the promoterregion of bag6 , it may perturb bag6 eression .","as a result , normal functions of bag6 in regulating cellular processes are disturbed ."
"the normal major allele homozygote was associated with reduced risk to osteoarthritis while the major - minor allele heterozygote contributed to the increased susceptibility , irrespective of anatomical site and gender in the croatian population .","results from the study indicate that variations in alleles and genotype of bag6 affect the etiology of osteoarthritis due to dysfunctions in bag6 protein regulatory roles ( wang et al . , ) ."
"this is suggestive of bag6 ' s behavior as a repressor of tim - 3 activity which functions by protecting helper t - cells from galectin - 9 - mediated death , thereby promoting pro - inflammatory cytokine production and proliferation ( binici & koch , ; kawahara et al . , ; rangachari et al . , ) .",this is supported eerimentally whereby increased levels of tim - 3 and low frequency of ifn - - production were observed in bag6 - deficient t - cells .
"as outlined in this section , bag6 is a crucial multi - functional protein contributing to several diseases .",it is involved in several unrelated cellular pathways and plays a pivotal role by functioning at the interface of protein synthesis and quality control of nascent polypeptides .
"however , to fully understand the functions of bag6 in such diseases , a range of patient cohorts need to be investigated , not limiting to certain geographical regions to understand the full potential of bag6 as a target , thus allowing elucidation of specific diseases that may benefit from bag6 counteractions .","the role of bag6 in immune response regulation allows the multifunctional protein to behave as a promising diagnostic , more so a prognostic marker protein , whereby this unravels promising new perspectives for conventional therapies , for example , in autoimmune disease ."
"this requires full mapping and structural characterization of substrate - bag6 interactions and upon discovery , manipulations can be made helping combat disease .","furthermore , the bag6 cofactors contribute to recognizing and determining the fate of hydrophobic substrates but the mechanism it follows is yet to be fully understood ."
"although bag6 binds its substrates with high affinity , it is unknown how bag6 is able to release individual substrates upon reaching their final destination .",a number of answers regarding bag6 ' s role in health and disease are yet to be discovered .
"the process was defined in yeast systems as the guided entry of ta proteins ( get ) pathway ( denic , ) or transmembrane domain recognition complex ( trc ) pathway in mammalian systems ( johnson , powis , & high , ) .","the studies made evident that ta protein targeting and insertion can be regulated , particularly in mammalian systems ."
"using a new protease protection assay a key component of the pathway essential for membrane insertion was found : the atpase trc40 ( also known as asna1 , yeast homolog termed get3 ) , trailblazing the proximate identification of the other components in further studies using genetic and biochemical approaches .","the challenges involved in identifying the components in the trc pathway were likely a result of heterogeneity of insertion assays measuring binding of ta proteins ( stefanovic & hegde , ) ."
"to be trc35 and ubl4a , respectively , forming a complex with an additional protein bag6 ( bat3 ) ( mariappan et al . , ) .","in large scale yeast genetic interaction profiles sgt2 was found as another essential factor in protein targeting by virtue of its strong functional relationship with the get pathway ( chang et al . , ) ."
this quality control pathway is well - balanced allowing nascent proteins to mature but forcing degradation of poorly folded proteins over time .,"accurate triage of degradation versus biosynthesis is essential for maintaining the desired quantity of ta proteins in the membrane , and ensuring the quality of proteins meets the requirements ."
bag6 was found to bridge ubl4a and trc35 and form a similar construct ( cbag6 ) .,"prior to the structure elucidation , sequencing alignment eeriments suggested that ubl4a in higher eukaryotes lacks the get5 - n domain , and trc35 does not have a - loop , both of which interact in yeast to form the get4 / 5 complex ."
"as a result of the absent - hairpin , and are shifted compared to get4 resulting in the greater rmsd of the ctd .","get4 was found to physically interact with get3 as well as get5 , the mammalian homolog trc35 interacts with trc40 as well as bag6 ( mediator of ubl4a interaction ) , and the residues of trc35 at both the trc40 and bag6 binding interfaces are well conserved from the yeast homologs ."
"this interface is also conserved in mammalian systems and the ba g6 ( l1032 , y1036 and m1040 ) interacts along the helices , , of trc35 ( f195 and m271 ) ( mock et al . , ) .","an extended , highly ordered loop following the - helix of get5 - n lies along the helices , , of get4 which form a well - conserved pronounced hydrophobic cleft , a result of an insertion in the loop connecting and and subsequent deviation of the and from the helical arrangement ( chang et al . , ) ."
"ubl4a - c domain was found to contain three helices , helices and form the dimer interface with conserved hydrophobic residues , and helix wraps around bag6 - c ( kuwabara et al . , ) .",verifying that bag6 mediates the indirect interaction between trc35 and ubl4a .
"the interaction of the complex with these two proteins provides insight into how priority and time are encoded within the sorting system for different hydrophobic substrates ( shao et al . , ) .","the cbag6 complex in mammals acts as a pre - targeting step for insertion of ta proteins , and it is a crucial part of the trc pathway mediating the transfer of proteins from sgta ( sgt2 in yeast ) to trc40 ( get3 in yeast ) ."
"in a large scale genetic yeast study using small molecules , get4 and get5 were found to have highest correlation scores as interactors of sgt2 based on homozygous co - sensitivity for yeast deletion strains ( hillenmeyer et al . , ) .","in vitro immunoprecipitation results showed sgt2 in varying ( almost invariably lower ) concentrations compared to the identical amounts of get4 and get5 , suggestive of a transient association of sgt2 with the get4 / 5 complex , therefore a dynamic stoichiometry ( chang et al . , ) ."
"the negatively charged residues of sgta - nt at the binding interface ( d27 , e30 , e33 , e40 ) are highly conserved , interacting with conserved positively charged residues of ubl4a - ubl ( k6 , k66 , k46 , k48 ) .",the greatest difference between the interactions of mammalian and yeast complexes is the r otation of the mammalian system due to the shift in the charge distribution of key residues on the surface of each interacting partner .
get3 binding by a hydrophobic substrate is thought to be the point at which it is committed to the ta protein insertion route .,"get3 is an atpase , it forms a "" closed "" configuration when bound to atp ( and in some cases adp ) ; in this form a hydrophobic nucleotide - binding groove is available , thereby increasing its affinity for ta proteins ( mateja et al . , ) ."
"the first is the anchoring interface responsible for binding specificity , and it involves ( y30 , r37 , r42 ) of get4 forming hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts within the groove created by and of get ( f246 , y250 , e253 , q257 , e258 , e304 , d308 ) .","in vitro isothermal titration calorimetry eeriments ( itc ) with purified wild type and mutant get4 / 5 - n and get3 components together with the crystal structures of the get3 - get4 / 5 complex found two functionally distinct binding interfaces between get3 and get4 ( chang et al . , ; chartron et al . , ; gristick et al . , ) ."
"get4 / 5 has been indisputably proven to use a dual mechanism to aid ta protein insertion , a first passive mode involves binding get3 and tethering it near ta proteins held by sgt2 , acting simply as a bridge .","in yeast systems the get4 / 5 complex is associated with the ribosome via the interaction of get5 with sgt2 , and get4 / 5 interacts with get3 targeting protein by the get4 ."
"this has been related to mammalian systems as the trc pathway , the picture that has emerged is of initial hydrophobic protein capture at the ribosome , then assembly into highly dynamic sorting complex containing many potential binding partners .","the pathway protects against high levels of aggregation , and it allows a rapid and private bridging mechanism of transfer from sgta to trc40 using the get4 / 5 complex equivalent cbag6 ( wang et al . , ) ."
following these observed phenotypes in yeast get4 and get5 deletion assays it appeared likely that the deletion of ubl4a and trc35 which are closely related in sequence and function will have similar effects in mammalian constructs .,"as yet , there is no published report as to the effects of deletion of these crucial bridging proteins in relation to the delivery of ta proteins , and the consequences of reduced delivery ."
"this field is still rapidly evolving and there are many outstanding questions , in particular with regard to understanding the roles of this machinery in disease states .",it is likely that one or more of the proteins discussed here is already under investigation as a drug target and that many of the interaction partners for these proteins have yet to be identified .
they are thus good candidates to develop novel oral vectors and constitute attractive alternatives to vaccinal strategies based on attenuated pathogens which could induce healthy risks .,"here , we summarized the most recent researches performed on the use of lab as live vaccine delivery vectors ."
"opportunistic infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in severely immunocompromised patients , such as those receiving chemotherapy or with haematological malignancy , aplastic anaemia or hiv infection , or recipients of solid - organ or stem cell transplants .","in addition , the increasing use of biological therapies will result in more patients at risk of opportunistic infections , albeit to a lesser degree than classic causes of immunocompromise ."
"opportunistic lung infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality for patients immunocompromised because of hiv infection , haematological malignancy , aplastic anaemia or chemotherapy treatment , or who are recipients of solid - organ or stem cell transplants , and also may complicate treatment with the new biological therapies for inflammatory conditions .",eert clinical assessment with early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are required for a positive outcome .
cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses the herpesvirus cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) is an important cause of lung infection in patients with impaired t - cell - mediated immunity such as transplant recipients .,"cmv infection is defined as active cmv replication regardless of symptoms or signs , whilst cmv disease is infection associated with evidence of organ - specific disease ."
"cmv pneumonitis is more likely with high - level viraemia , especially if the viral load increased rapidly .","tumour necrosis factor a inhibitors and risk of mycobacterial disease , endemic fungi and legionella pneumophila ; anti - cd20 drugs and mycobacterial disease , cytomegalovirus pneumonitis and pjp ) c early detection of aspergillus using non - culture - based techniques be absent in patients with cmv pneumonitis ."
"in the absence of pneumonia , the mortality from respiratory virus infection is relatively low although infection can persist for several weeks .","if npa is negative , immunofluorescence or pcr on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( balf ) has a higher sensitivity ."
"the organisms involved are more diverse than those seen in conventional pneumonia and include both gram - positive ( streptococcus pneumoniae , staphylococcus aureus ) and gram - negative ( e . g .","the major risk factors are neutropenia , antibody deficiencies and high - dose corticosteroids ."
"post - transplantation ) , prolonged glucocorticoid therapy , malignancy , graft versus host disease ( gvhd ) , diabetes mellitus , chronic granulomatous disease and alveolar proteinosis .","nocardia pneumonia usually develops over weeks with cough , haemoptysis , weight loss , fever and night sweats but can be more acute ."
"the diagnosis can be made rapidly through identification of characteristic beaded , branching gram - positive and weakly acid - fast filaments on microscopy .",blood and sputum cultures can be positive but require prolonged aerobic culture .
"prophylaxis with trimethoprimesulphamethoxazole or nebulized pentamidine is recommended in patients with hiv infection ( cd4 count < 200 cells / mm ) , transplant recipients ( solid organ and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( hsct ) ) and those receiving prolonged high - dose glucocorticoids ( > 20 mg / day for days or longer ) .","second - line therapies include clindamycin plus primaquine , pentamidine , atovaquone , or trimethoprim plus dapsone ."
"radiological features include diffuse interstitial infiltrates , focal consolidation , discrete nodules , and hilar lymphadenopathy .",diagnosis is by microscopic identification ( indian ink stain ) or culture from respiratory tract samples .
"common endemic fungi causing pulmonary infections include histoplasma capsulatum , coccidioides ( coccidioides immitis and coccidioides posadasii ) , blastomyces dermatitidis and sporothrix schenckii .","reactivation of latent infection can occur in immunocompromised patients , especially with defects in t - cellmediated immunity , so a history of travel or residence in a high - risk area can be relevant ."
r apid differential diagnosis of infectious diseases is increasingly important as novel pathogens emerge in new contexts and treatment strategies are beginning to be tailored to specific infectious agents .,"because clinical syndromes are rarely specific for single pathogens , unbiased multiplex assays are essential ."
"however , it is not sufficient when larger numbers of known pathogens must be considered , when new but related pathogens are anticipated , or when sequence divergence might impair binding of pcr primers .","thus , to address the challenge of more highly multiplexed differential diagnosis , we established an oligonucleotide microarray platform ."
"we report establishment of a microarray platform for pathogen surveillance and discovery , the greenechip system .","its key features include a comprehensive microbial sequence database for probe design and protocols for sample preparation , amplification , labeling , hybridization , and analysis ."
"the rrna sequences of fungi , bacteria , and parasites obtained from the ribosomal database project ( rdp , ) or the ncbi database were added to create a panmicrobial database ( greenepmdb ) .","the greenepmdb comprises the , 638 viral sequences of the greenevrdb that represent complete and partial viral genomes , and , 790 bacterial s rrnas , , 109 fungal s rrnas , and , 626 s parasitic rrnas ."
"when possible , we chose highly conserved regions within a coding sequence for an enzyme such as a polymerase and other regions that corresponded to more variable structural proteins .",we thought that rnas that encode structural proteins may be present at higher levels than those that encode proteins needed only in catalytic amounts and that use of probes representing noncontiguous sites along the genome might allow detection of naturally occurring or intentionally created chimeric viruses .
our intent in implementing the greenechip was to have the potential to identify known and related agents for which precise sequence information was not available .,"to assess the extent to which a given probe sequence can hybridize to a nonmatching but related sequence , we analyzed synthetic mismatch controls ."

the prevailing approach for studying gene eression profiles is limited in its ability to identify these would - be targets for broadspectrum antiviral therapeutics .,"many gene eression microarray studies have proposed distinct gene signatures to discriminate different viral infections ( zaas et al . , ) or influenza from bacterial infections ( parnell et al . , ( parnell et al . , , ramilo et al . , ) ."
"we have developed an integrated , multi - cohort analysis framework that leverages the heterogeneity present in public data repositories ( e . g . , geo and arrayeress ) , which in turn increases sample size and allows for the identification and validation of robust and reproducible signatures of a disease phenotype .","we have demonstrated the utility of this framework in identifying novel drug targets , diagnostic biomarkers , and repurposing fda - approved drugs ( chen et al . , ; khatri et al . , ; li et al . , ; mazur et al . , ; sweeney et al . , ) ."
"first , to obtain a common transcriptional signature across all respiratory viral infections , we applied our method to three gene eression datasets of human blood samples from three viral infections ( influenza , human rhinovirus [ hrv ] , and respiratory syncytial virus [ rsv ] ) , measured on two different microarray platforms in three countries to identify a robust - gene meta - virus signature ( mvs ) of respiratory viral infections .","we tested this signature against independent cohorts composed of , 087 blood samples to show that it was not confounded by sample tissue , treatment , viral strain , or microarray technology ."
we applied our method to five influenza gene eression datasets consisting of samples and identified an - gene influenza meta - signature ( ims ) .,"using additional independent cohorts , we showed that this influenza - specific signature was able to discriminate symptomatic from asymptomatic subjects , influenza infection from other respiratory viral infections , and patients with mixed influenza and / or bacterial pneumonia from those with bacterial pneumonia alone ."
these two multi - cohort analyses showed that there was a conserved host response to respiratory viral infections and there were virus - specific responses that could distinguish different virus types .,both have significant potential for use in the diagnosis and treatment of viral infections .
"in order to avoid the potential influence of a single cohort on the results due to unequal sample sizes or other unknown confounding factors among cohorts , we performed a ' ' leave - one - cohort - out ' ' analysis .","we hypothesized that the resulting set of genes that were significantly differentially eressed , irrespective of the set of cohorts analyzed , would constitute a robust signature of respiratory viral infection ."
"other significant and relevant kegg pathways included cell cycle , nf - kb signaling , toll - like receptor signaling , lysosome , and sphingolipid metabolism .","kegg pathway analysis using ipathwayguide ( draghici et al . , ; khatri et al . , ; tarca et al . , ) of the mvs identified significant pathways , including pathways for viral infections such as epstein - barr virus , influenza a , herpes simplex , and measles ( table s3 ) ."
"out of mvs overeressed genes ( 84.5% ) , and out of undereressed mvs genes ( 59.14% ) were statistically significant ( p < 5 ) in the validation cohorts ( figure b ) .",these data indicated that the mvs defined broad immunological responses in the host to respiratory viral infection .
"the mvs is specific to viral infection differential diagnosis of bacterial versus viral infection is confounded by similar clinical symptoms and underlying conditions such as immunosuppression and extrapulmonary complications ( babcock et al . , ; ison and lee , ; parnell et al . , parnell et al . , , ramilo et al . , ) .","therefore , we elored whether the mvs could distinguish viral infections from bacterial infections ."
these results suggest that the mvs score is not confounded by the febrile status of children .,the mvs scores were significantly higher in afebrile rsv - infected children than in those with febrile bacterial infections ( p = 1 ) and distinguished both groups with high accuracy ( roc auc = ( figures a and s1a ) .
"however , the mvs scores increased significantly for virus - shedding symptomatic subjects over - 72 hr and began to decline toward asymptomatic baseline levels as symptoms resolved ( figures c , d , s1e , and s1g ) .",the mvs scores remained unchanged over time in asymptomatic subjects that were not shedding any virus in both groups .
"further examination of these individuals revealed that the asymptomatic subject , who followed a trajectory similar to the symptomatic group , was shedding the virus .","the original study referred to this subject as an ' ' asymptomatic shedder ' ' ( woods et al . , ) ."
"however , a larger systematic analysis of diverse viruses would be necessary to identify such a core signature .","our results also suggest that the mvs might be able to distinguish other viral infections prior to symptom onset similar to influenza , though additional challenge studies using other viruses are needed for validation ."
"therefore , we hypothesized that despite a common transcriptional response to most respiratory viral infections , there might be a virus - specific transcriptional response .","a number of studies have previously reported virus - and strainspecific signatures ( hu et al . , ; zaas et al . , ) ."
"in the discovery cohorts , we used samples from healthy individuals , patients with bacterial infection , and day ( pre - inoculation ) individuals as controls .",we used samples with influenza infection and individuals after inoculation as cases .
"although our very stringent criterion might have left out some genes with varying eression in influenza , it allowed for the identification of a reproducible transcriptional profile that was found in all five influenza discovery cohorts despite the presence of significant heterogeneity .",we identified genes ( fdr < %) as significantly overeressed ( table s4 and supplemental eerimental procedures ) .
"many of these genes have been shown to be overeressed after influenza infection ( ramilo et al . , ) , confirming the validity of our results .",network analysis of these genes by ingenuity pathway analysis ( ipa ) confirmed that of the genes are part of a network involved in innate virus sensing and initiation of antiviral response pathways ( figure s2 ) .
the remaining genes were homogeneously overeressed in patients infected with influenza across all discovery cohorts ( figures a - 3 k ; table s5 ) .,"network analysis by ipa showed that of these genes were interconnected , with irf7 and stat1 forming a central axis of transcriptional regulation ( figure l ) ."
"we asked whether the ims could distinguish between influenza and bacterial infections , similar to the mvs .","therefore , we defined the geometric mean of the ims genes as the ims score of a sample ."
"despite the presence of biological ( age , pathogens , antibiotics ) and technological ( three microarray platforms ) confounding factors , the ims scores of the patients with influenza infection were significantly higher than those of healthy controls and patients with bacterial infections ( p % 3 ; figures c , e , and g ) , with high specificity and sensitivity in distinguishing influenza patients from those with a variety of bacterial infections ( auc range 6-0.97 ; figures d , f , and h ) .","next , we compared the ims scores from pbmcs of pediatric patients ( age % years ) with influenza or bacterial infection ( staphylococcus aureus , streptococcus pneumoniae , and escherichia coli ) in an independent cohort ( gse : gse6269 ) ( ramilo et al . , ) ."
"these results suggested that the ims might be specific to influenza , because none of the patients in these cohorts were infected with influenza .","in contrast , the mvs scores were significantly higher in both of these cohorts ."
"therefore , we compared the ims scores of influenza - infected patients with those of patients with other respiratory viral infections ( rsv and hrv ) using three datasets ( gse : gse34205 , gse42026 , and gse38900 ) .",these datasets profiled whole blood samples from children ( age < years ) .
"blue nodes in the network represent ims genes , and red nodes represent genes that were significantly overeressed during influenza infection but are not included in the ims .","challenge study allowed for analysis of the ims scores during the initial acute phase of infection , whereas the pneumonia cohorts allowed for analysis of the ims scores in patients with an established infection as they progress through recovery and resolution of symptoms ."
"for example , the ims scores for all h3n2 symptomatic volunteers were higher than for asymptomatic volunteers at hr after inoculation ( auc = ; figure s4a ) , suggesting that the ims score correctly identified symptomatic volunteers prior to symptom onset .","furthermore , an increase in the average ims score of symptomatic volunteers also preceded symptom onset in both groups ."
"for instance , hr after inoculation , roc aucs were 4 and 5 in the h3n2 cohort for mvs and ims , respectively .","however , mvs and ims behaved differently in the gse52428 challenge study , where mvs achieved higher discriminatory power than ims at the same time point after inoculation ( figures c and d ) ."
"in the pneumonia cohorts , our analysis showed that the ims score remained unchanged from baseline in healthy controls and patients with bacterial pneumonia or sirs ( figures e and f ) .","in contrast , the ims scores of the influenza pneumonia patients were significantly higher than those of bacterial pneumonia ( p = 5 in gse40012 and p = 017 in gse20346 ) at the time of admission and progressively decreased over time in the influenza pneumonia patients ( p = in gse40012 and p = 3 in gse20346 ) ( figures e and f ) ."
"therefore , we elored the change in the ims scores after influenza vaccination in three independent cohorts of individuals .","despite a large number of influenza infection ( mejias et al . , ; parnell et al . , ; ramilo et al . , ) and vaccination ( franco et al . , ; furman et al . , ; nakaya et al . , ; tsang et al . , ) studies , no common transcriptional signature between influenza and vaccination has been proposed ."
"( gse : gse47353 ) divided vaccinated ( fluvirin , novartis ) healthy individuals into three groups ( low , moderate , and high responders ) that were defined as the lowest th percentile , st to th percentile , and above th percentile of microneutralization titers , respectively .","the ims scores increased significantly for the high ( paired t test p = 08 ) and moderate ( paired t test p = 6 ) responders , but not for low responders ( paired t test p > 5 ) on day after vaccination compared to day ( figure a ) ."
"in a cohort of females ( gse48023 ) , the ims scores increased significantly on day after vaccination in responders for h1n1 ( paired t test p = 02 ) and h3n2 ( paired t test p = 15 ) , but not in non - responders ( paired t test p > ) ( figures b and c ) .","therefore , we used this definition to categorize responders and non - responders in two independent vaccination cohorts ( gse : gse48018 and gse48023 from franco et al . , ) and elored whether the ims scores showed difference between vaccine responders and non - responders prior to the - day mark ."
"we investigated whether the ims response could be seen in epithelial cells , the target cell population for influenza replication .","indeed , in three independent datasets of samples , the ims scores increased significantly in cell lines of epithelial origin ( calu - 3 and a549 ) after influenza infection ( figure s6 ) ."
"furthermore , the increase in the ims score was fastest in cells treated with ifn - b ( 1.5 hr ) , slowest for infection with wild - type pr8 influenza virus with or without ns1 protein ( 6 hr ) , and intermediate for transfection with only viral rna ( 4 hr ) .","however , the magnitude of the change in the average ims score at hr after infection was higher for cells eed to influenza viral rna , infected with pr8 influenza virus lacking ns1 protein , or treated with ifn - b and is probably due to the absence of the ns1 protein that inhibits vrna - or ifn - b - induced pathways in each of these conditions ."
the goal of this study was to integrate gene eression data from multiple heterogeneous sources to define both a conserved host response to respiratory viral infection and one specific to influenza .,"these dual goals could be useful in multiple settings , such as determining the likely prognosis in a viral infection , the diagnosis of a specific viral infection , identifying vaccine responders , and uncovering new biological pathways and possible drug targets for further study ."
"using our previously described multi - cohort analysis framework , we analyzed independent cohorts from datasets consisting of , 939 samples that were collected in countries and represented infections from viruses and bacteria in whole blood , pbmcs , and epithelial cells to identify the mvs and ims that are robustly and consistently differentially eressed across age , gender , clinical time course , and illness severity .",our results showed that the mvs is able to distinguish virus - infected patients from those with bacterial infections or healthy controls with high accuracy and identify influenzainfected subjects at risk for being ill before onset of clinical symptoms .
"for instance , although the total number of genes reported by these studies ranged from to , none of the ims genes were reported by all studies .","although several groups have proposed influenza infectionspecific gene sets , there is little overlap among them ."
identification and validation of these robust and reproducible signatures across multiple independent cohorts could in turn enable further systematic global analyses .,"for instance , none of the existing studies of influenza infection and vaccination have elored how their proposed signatures relate infection and vaccination to each other ( furman et al . , ; hu et al . , ; li et al . , ; nakaya et al . , ; parnell et al . , parnell et al . , , ramilo et al . , ; tsang et al . , ; woods et al . , ) ."
"thus , it has remained unclear which of these genes were most relevant to influenza infection .",herein we identified a concise influenza response signature with many isgs .
"third , the ims score can be used as a more objective measure of a vaccination response .",our results in influenza - vaccinated individuals show that the ims score increases significantly in responders but remains unchanged in non - responders .
"in general , the ability to define metrics for the immune system , such as we have done here , goes beyond the concept of biomarkers and provides a means to measure and understand functional and , potentially , mechanistic pathophysiological relationships for other diseasespecific clinical cohorts .","finally , the specificity of ims to influenza compared to other respiratory viruses enables identification of a virus - specific immune metric that can be applied to both vaccination and natural infection studies , and might be a starting place for studies of differential biology of influenza infection ."
"the samples in these datasets represented different biological conditions including viral infections ( influenza , rsv , hrv , sars , adenovirus , enterovirus , hhv6 ) , bacterial infections ( e . coli , s . aureus , s . pneumonie , salmonella ) , non - pathogenic systematic inflammatory response , and healthy controls .","we downloaded microarray gene eression datasets from the ncbi geo comprising , 939 samples derived from whole blood , pbmcs , epithelial cells , or cell lines ( table s1 ) ."
"for each study , we used the sample phenotypes as defined by the primary publication of a source study .",microarray probes in each dataset were mapped to entrez gene identifiers ( ids ) to facilitate integrated analysis .
"we estimated the effect size for each gene in each dataset as hedges ' adjusted g . if multiple probes mapped to a gene , the effect size for each gene was summarized via the fixed effect inverse - variance model .","we applied two meta - analysis methods as described in our previous publications ( figure s1 ; tables s1 and s2 ) : combining effect sizes and combining p values ( chen et al . , ; khatri et al . , ; sweeney et al . , ) ."
"we used fisher ' s sum of logs method ( fisher , ) for meta - analysis by combining p values .","for each gene , we summed the logarithm of the onesided hypothesis testing p values across k studies and compared the result to a c - distribution with k degrees of freedom ."
"in order to avoid influence of a dataset with a large sample size on the results , we removed one dataset at a time and applied both meta - analysis methods at each iteration .",we did not filter for heterogeneity between datasets when identifying mvs because different viruses can induce various genes at different levels .
we defined the ims score of a sample as the geometric mean of the normalized log2 - transformed eression of the overeressed genes .,"we defined the mvs score of a sample as the geometric mean of the normalized , log2 - transformed eression of the overeressed genes minus that of the undereressed genes ."
"in these datasets , we used mean of the normalized log2 - transformed eression values to compute the mvs and ims scores .","if a dataset contained negative values , computing a geometric mean is not possible ."
meta - effect size across all viral infections was used as fold change in ipathwayguide to identify significant pathways .,"we performed functional pathway analysis via ipathwayguide ( draghici et al . , ; khatri et al . , ; tarca et al . , ) ."
"all datasets , except one ( gse19392 ) , are whole blood or pbmc samples obtained from patients with or without a viral infection over wide range of age ( from less than months to over years ) .",we incorporated technical heterogeneity in our analysis by choosing datasets that were profiled using microarrays from different manufacturers .
"for each study , we used the sample phenotypes as defined by the primary publication of a source study .",microarray probes in each data set were mapped to entrez gene identifiers ( ids ) to facilitate integrated analysis .
"the mvs analysis incorporated datasets from multiple respiratory viruses , while the ims analysis examined only influenza .","to that end , we performed two multi - cohort analyses , which we termed ' metavirus signature ' ( mvs ) and ' influenza meta - signature ' ( ims ) ."
"we chose three datasets ( gse34205 , gse42026 , and gse40396 ) , from which we created five discovery cohorts .","unlike a conventional biological eeriment , we sought to represent biological and technical heterogeneity observed in the population by choosing cohorts that were collected at different centers and profiled using different technologies ."
"we also incorporated technical heterogeneity in our samples as before , by choosing datasets that were profiled using different microarray platforms .","we chose datasets that were collected at centers in different countries to represent different biological confounding factors such as population genetics , treatment protocols and infectious agents ."
"in gse40012 , only samples from patients with influenza pneumonia and healthy controls were used , irrespective of which day the samples were taken ; the rest of the samples in this dataset ( bacterial pneumonia , mixed - pneumonia , and non - infectious systematic inflammatory response ) were used for validation of the ims in figure a and f .","in gse34205 and gse42026 , we used samples from healthy controls and influenza - infected samples , but samples from rsv - infected patients were used for validating specificity of the ims to influenza infection in figure a and b ."
we applied two meta - analysis methods as described in our previous publication ( supplementary figure ; supplementary table ) .,"in this framework , for each analysis a subset of the total datasets was selected to be used as discovery cohorts as described above ( supplementary table ) , and analyzed using two meta - analysis methods : i ) combining effect sizes and ii ) combining p - values ."
"for each gene , we summed the logarithm of the one - sided hypothesis testing p - values across k studies , and compared the result to a - distribution with k degrees of freedom .",we used fisher ' s sum of logs method for meta - analysis by combining p - values .
a dataset with a large sample size can significantly influence meta - analysis results .,"therefore , we performed meta - analysis by removing one dataset at a time in order to avoid influence of a single dataset in identifying the mvs and ims ."
we used the wilcon - mann - whitney or anova to test whether there was a statistically significant difference between the mvs or ims scores of two groups .,"if a dataset contained negative values , computing a geometric mean is not possible ."
the best international practices and eeriences will be adapted and put into practice .,all the prevention and control work must take the local situation and realities into consideration .
preventive measures and methods should be introduced to the general population to make them aware of how they can protect themselves and prevent disease .,education of high - risk groups such as prostitutes and drug abusers about relevant laws and regulations against these activities should aim at behavioral changes in these groups .
the scientists ' messages promoted greater concern about the possibility of a widespread epidemic at the level of the national government .,"on april , the state council held a discussion on the prevention of aids and other stis , and the politburo met to discuss hiv in early ."
"the action plan certainly provided cover for the small , eerimental interventions described in chap .",""" some local government leaders are not fully aware of the potential risk of an enlarged hiv epidemic , and the social and economic impact on society in china "" , the text read ."
"they used this strategy politically , too , encouraging high - level representatives from other countries and international organisations to raise the issue of hiv when they visited china .","when learning about the behaviours that spread hiv and while trying out different prevention programmes , chinese scientists and health professionals had discovered the value of working with partners from other countries ."
"speaking the following week at china ' s first national aids and std conference , piot made an impassioned plea for china ' s leaders to show more resolve in tackling aids .",""" over the next two decades what happens in china will determine the global burden of hiv / aids "" , he said ."
"less than a year later , in october , united nations secretary - general kofi annan added his voice to a growing chorus demanding greater commitment from the chinese leadership .",""" there is no time to lose if china is to prevent a massive further spread of hiv / aids "" , he told an audience at zhejiang university ."
"cumulatively , these visits did contribute to a gradual change of thinking on behalf of china ' s policy makers .",""" somehow , external voices are always more influential "" , noted one aids programme official ."
"in the early years of the epidemic , even the official bulletin of the chinese academy of preventive medicine ' s aids programme , which carried aids case reports and data from other types of hiv surveillance and research , was classified as a confidential internal document .",it was no secret to anyone in china or abroad that statistics produced by government departments were not always accurate due to difficulties in data collection and other problems .
"officials recognised that this was nothing like the real number of cases ; in china as in most other lower - and middle - income countries at the time , only a small fraction of hiv infections had actually been identified through testing .","when interacting with the press , including with foreign journalists , officials usually confined themselves to reporting the number of confirmed , registered hiv cases : , 711 in september , for example ."
"though they were published by the highest administrative body in the land , these estimates were not widely publicised as officials continued to report the number of confirmed hiv cases and journalists continued quite wrongly to assume that this represented the government ' s official estimate of the total number of people living with hiv in china .","this misunderstanding led many people to believe that china was deliberately covering up the extent of its hiv epidemic , even though that was not the case ."
"with that number already on public record , china ' s scientists argued , why not try and do a better job at home ?","they used a simple spreadsheet - based model that included estimates of the number of drug injectors , sex workers , clients , gay men , and former plasma donors , and then combined that information with estimates of the percentage of each of those groups infected with hiv ."
"using the eerience of the first round of estimates coupled with better data sources , the ministry of heath updated the figures the following year .","in april , they announced that they believed some , 000 people were living with hiv in the country ."
the organisations that joined to become the national centre for aids / std control and prevention had sought international guidance in building up a national hiv surveillance system and provided a lot of training and support to provincial governments .,"several of the worst affected provinces , led by yunnan , built up a strong hiv surveillance system in high - risk groups early in the epidemic ."
""" when you try to hide numbers , well , people will just make them up "" , said us cdc ' s ray yip .",the biggest splash was made by the united nations theme group on hiv / aids in china .
other eerts have put the number of cases in china higher by varying amounts .,"a unaids report in china in estimated as many as million people living with hiv / aids "" , the report said ."
"some of the major factors that have contributed to the relatively slow response to aids in china comprise insufficient openness in confronting the epidemic , a lack of commitment and leadership at many levels of government , especially provincial and local levels , a lack of adequate resources , a crumbling public health care system , and severe stigma and discrimination against people infected or affected by hiv / aids .","indeed , we are now witnessing the unfolding of an hiv / aids epidemic of proportions beyond belief . . ."
"zunyou wu , now director of ncaids at china cdc , agrees : "" it was definitely a wake - up call .","if you always go slowly and peacefully , you can ' t change anything "" ."
"the first apparent case was reported to chinese health authorities in november , but china did not share the information with the world health organization until february .",sars is an airborne viral infection that seems to have spread from domestic animals to humans in southern china .
china ' s failure to confront the sars epidemic openly and to report cases quickly and honestly in the earlier stage left the country ' s reputation very badly bruised .,but it also opened the door to a new way of doing things .
"beijing ' s dark side was exemplified by its initial cover - up of the epidemic , and by its knee - jerk resorting to draconian measures developed during the aids epidemic , such as the jailing of ' intentional transmitters . '","the sars epidemic has shown both the old face of the chinese political system , and a potentially new face ."
one of those was the idea that news of disease outbreaks would shame china in the eyes of the world .,""" we did need courage to break down some ingrained ideas , to break through some barriers "" , the former vice minister said ."
one of the important effects of the sars epidemic was that it removed the bureaucratic filter that usually stood between scientists and the country ' s most senior politicians .,"according to us cdc ' s ray yip , "" sars brought the scientists into contact with people they wouldn ' t normally be able to react with "" ."
""" we must learn the lessons of our success in fighting sars , and carry out hiv / aids prevention and control in a practical , active and urgent way "" .","she called for more accurate estimates of the extent of infection and more prevention research , as well as a more open and pragmatic attitude ."
"hiv testing would be made universally available for free to all chinese citizens via the local cdc or other approved facilities , and all hiv - positive pregnant women would get free antiretroviral drugs and free infant formula milk they needed to reduce transmission of the virus to their babies .","in september , speaking in front of the united nations general assembly ' s special session on hiv / aids , executive vice minister of health gao qiang , on behalf of premier wen jiabao , made an extraordinary commitment : the chinese government promised to provide free antiretroviral treatment for all rural aids patients , as well as for poorer patients in china ' s cities ."
"in its earliest incarnation , the four frees and one care programme was underwritten by a grant from the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria .","while gao qiang lobbied colleagues in other departments to raise domestic spending on health , gao qiang also encouraged the judicious use of funds available from other sources ."
the story of how they did that is told in chap .,"now , they apparently had the green light to reproduce their successes on a much larger scale ."
"s protein could be cleaved by egenous trypsin but not by coeressed furin , suggesting that the protein is not normally processed during infection .","to investigate scov s protein , full - length and individual domains of s protein were eressed on the surface of insect cells and were characterized for cleavability and reactivity with serum samples obtained from patients during the convalescent phase of sars ."
"however , the spectrum of the antibody response , its role in viral clearance , and its use as a correlate of protection has not been described .","during the convalescent phase of sars , antibody against the whole virus can be detected at day and increases to a peak titer by day ."
"for plaque assays , cells were allowed to settle onto polystyrene dishes for h before virus inoculation .","after virus adsorption , cells were sequentially overlaid with % lowmelting - temperature agarose and then with sf900 - ii supplemented with % fetal calf serum and were cultured for more days before staining with neutral red ."
"each fragment was cloned into a set of vectors ( 18 variants in all ) , to provide his - tagged , maltose binding protein - tagged , and cell surface - displayed forms of s protein .",all fragments generated were flanked by dissimilar restriction sites for the enzyme sfii .
cells were plated in a well plate ( cells / well ) and overlaid with ml of me - dium .,"after virus inoculation , cells were cultured for a further days at c , harvested , washed with pbs , fixed with cellfix ( becton dickinson ) , and stained with serum and conjugate ."
"no human cov oc43 serum samples were available for the present study , so the reactivity of cov oc43 with sars s protein could not be assessed .","similarly , only serum samples from cov e - infected patients were available ."
"we examined a number of biochemical features , to characterize the protein eression before use for antibody binding .",the s protein signal peptide and tm domain were substituted for regions known to function well in this eression system - a signal peptide from the major baculovirus glycoprotein gp64 and a tm domain from the vsv g protein already present in pacvsv g tm .
"to assess whether the calnexin pathway was relevant to eression of s protein , we coinfected recombinant full - length s protein with a virus - eressing calnexin and re - examined the level of glycosylated and nonglycosylated protein at days after infection .","the s proteins of all covs are heavily glycosylated , and improper glycan trimming can result in poor surface - eression levels through retention of the viral glycoprotein by the glycoprotein chaperone calnexin ."
"recombinant s protein produced in the presence of coeressed furin showed no evidence of cleavage ( figure b ) , suggesting that furin is not associated with scov envelope maturation .","the consensus furin cleavage site does not occur in the s protein sequence , but several dibasic sites , which also can be recognized by the enzyme , are present , allowing the possibility of furin cleavage ."
"when serum reactivity was assessed by use of wb , however , the pattern of binding was substantially different .","reactivity was seen with the full - length protein s - f1r1 , but strong binding was also seen with s - f2r1 and s - f3r1 ( figure , bottom ) ."
"and m . z . , unpublished data ) , so the use of a more specific test for seroconversion , based on s protein , may be valuable .","serum samples from patients with confirmed cov e infection did not react with s - f1r2 by use of facs ( figure ) , whereas the serum sample from a patient with suspected sars showed a weak but clear shift in fluorescence ."
the earliest wb - positive serum sample ( 10 days after onset ) gave a pattern of binding similar to that of the other serum samples tested ( figures and ) .,serum samples were also used in wb assays to examine the changes of reactivity with each individual s protein fragment over time .
"in the present study , full - length s protein on the surface of insect cells did not bind a variety of species of red blood cells , suggesting that it does not hemagglutinate .",s protein released by detergent lysis also failed to bind to any discrete proteins in far - western blot assay of vero cell membranes ( data not shown ) .
"differential antibody binding was not influenced by the high - mannose glycans present on insect - derived glycoproteins , because s protein prepared in mimic cells ( invitrogen ) , which add complex glycans to the polypeptide , showed the same pattern of reactivity with the serum samples used ( data not shown ) .","thus , although facs showed the highest reactivity with fragments , including the amino terminus of s protein , wb with the same serum samples showed preferential reactivity to the carboxyl terminal half of the molecule ."
"our preliminary work with purified soluble full - length s protein suggests that sensitivity is maintained with the soluble protein , indicating that assay formats simpler than flow cytometry will be feasible .","this class of antibody includes those most useful for diagnosis ( see above ) , suggesting that the most suitable assay format for a final diagnostic will be best configured with authentically folded protein , rather than , for example , peptides ."
the spinal cord and its leptomeninges were involved to a lesser degree .,the histopathological picture as well as the laboratory findings suggests a viral cause of the disease .
"thirty cats were affected , seven of which were examined post . mortem .","these showed , throughout the brain and spinal cord , mononuclear perivascular cuffing , gliosis and meningitis ."
"in , strijm reviewed the clinical findings in cases of staggering disease recorded from till .",", the disease has become recognized in certain parts of sweden and is referred to as "" staggering disease "" ."
the present investigation details the pathological and clinical features of staggering disease and includes a search for aetiological agents with the use of immunohistochemistry and serology .,"furthermore , it was decided to discuss the possible aetiology of the disease based on modern knowledge of feline infectious agents ."
four cats were clinically examined at private veterinary clinics and afterwards referred to the department of pathology for necropsy .,fifteen cats were examined by several small animal veterinarians at the university clinics .
the number of cases in which the different parts of the brain and spinal cord were examined are shown in table .,"from the spinal cord , sections were taken from cervical , thoracic and lumbar segments ."
"in cases , portions of the proximal sciatic nerve were taken for histological examination .",portions of the eyes and sartorius muscles were taken from eight cats .
"sections of the basal ganglia , hippocampus , thalamus , mesencephalon , caudal colliculus , obex and the spinal cord were stained with lul fast blue , nissl , giemsa , phosphotungstic acid haematoxylin , gomori ' s reticulin and lendrum ' s stain for inclusion bodies in selected cases .",paraffin wax sections were cut l . trn thick and stained with haematoxylin and eosin ( he ) .
"the presence of inflammation in the leptomeninges was graded from to with regard to the degree of cellular infiltration where = slight , = moderate , evere .","the size of the inflammatory nodules was rated from to where = a few cells , = moderate cluster of cells , = extensive cellular infiltration ."
"and a . uggla , swedish national veterinary blood chemistry and csf analysis complete blood analysis was performed in cats .","in five cats , material from the parietal lobe , basal ganglia , thalamus , mesencephalon , caudal colliculus , cerebellum and pons were fixed in buffered per cent formalin for h and then examined for the presence of pseudorabies virus antigen , canine distemper virus ( cdv ) antigen and tolasma gondii antigen , by the peroxidase - antiperoxidase ( pap ) immunohistochemical method ( sternberger , ) with polyclonal primary rabbit antibodies kindly su rijksuniversiteit , ghent , belgium ( pseudorabies ) , lied by p . de groot c . rmell swedish national bacteriological laboratory ( cdv ) institute ( tolasma gondii ) ."
"cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) of seven cats was obtained by cisternal puncture and examined for colour , turbidity , protein content , total red ( rbc ) and white blood cell ( wbc ) counts and differential cell count .","serology serum from cats was tested for the presence of felv antigen and antibodies to fiv using an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) kit ( cite - combo - test , idexx corp . , portland , me , u . s . a . ) ."
"some of the cats with staggering disease came from urban , but mostly ( 68 per cent ) from rural surroundings of uppland and malardalen , sweden .","cases of the disease occurred throughout the year , but most often from december to may ."
"fifteen cats were male ( 60 per cent ) , twelve of them neutered .","the cats were aged to years , the mean age being years ."
four cats came from households where there were other cats unaffected by the disease .,one cat came from a home where two other cats previously had been affected by staggering disease .
"in two of the cats with leukopenia , the differential cell count was normal .","the other three cats with leukopenia showed mild neutropenia and mild lymphocytosis ; the neutrophil - lymphocyte ratio being : 58 , : 59 and : 66 , respectively ( normal range of the neutrophil count : to per cent ; normal range of the lymphocyte count : to per cent ) ."
six of the cats tested for antibodies against fcov were negative ( titre < in ) .,"in two cats the fcov antibody titre was in and in , respectively ."
"parenchymal lesions in the cerebellum were slight or absent , whereas cerebellar meningitis was severe .","in the medulla oblongata , lesions were not as extensive as in the more proximal sections of the brain stem ."
the liver of three cats showed varying degrees of fatty change .,"the cortex of the kidney of cats exhibited small interstitial collections of lymphocytes , histiocytes and plasma cells ."
"in eight cats , the lymph follicles of the spleen were reduced in number .",the retropharyngeal lymph nodes showed follicular hyperplasia and abundant accumulation of lymphocytes in cortex and paracortex in five cats .
"the abundance of neurological signs in cats with staggering disease is a reflection of a widespread failure of the nervous system , typically seen in disseminated inflammations .","the laboratory findings , including leukopenia and elevations in protein content and wbc count of the csf , are not specific for viral infection , but at least suggest that the disease in the cats of this study is infectious in its nature ."
any of these viruses as well as some other agents known to cause cns disorders in cats could be the cause of staggering disease .,"the most notable viral agents causing progressive multifocal involvement of the cns in cats are feline infectious peritonitis virus ( fipv ) , feline leukaemia virus ( felv ) and feline immunodeficiency virus ( fiv ) ."
the results of serological investigation for coronavirus antibodies do not support the view that fipv or other coronaviruses are plausible aetiological agents in feline non - suppurative meningoencephalomyelitis .,"in the present investigation , all major lesions were confined to the cns ."
"however , felv is more commonly associated with epidural lymphosarcoma , which is usually manifested as acute posterior paresis or paralysis ( pedersen , b ) .","feline leukaemia virus ( felv ) has been reported as a cause of encephalitis in cats ( sottiaux and pialat , ) ."
"seroconversion in fiv infection may be delayed for months or even years ( sparger , ) .",antibodies against fiv were not found in the cats of the present study .
"in addition , six of the cats with staggering disease had been vaccinated against feline panleukopenia .","both clinical and histopathological data ( csiza , de lahunta , scott and gillespie , ) are different from the cats of this report ."
sweden is a rabies - free country and staggering disease has neither the clinical signs nor histological features typical of rabies .,"aujeszky ' s disease ( pseudorabies ) , which is fatal in carnivores ( dow and mcferran , ) , is excluded because of differences in the clinical picture , absence of intranuclear acidophilic inclusion bodies in neurones and astroglia and negative immunohistochemical staining for virus antigen ."
"domestic cats are susceptible to eerimental infection with cdv , but natural disease has not been reported in cats ( appel , sheffy , percy and gaskin , ) .","canine distemper virus ( cdv ) has been reported as a cause of encephalomyelitis in tigers ( blythe , schmitz , roelke and skinner , ) ."
tick borne encephalitis virus ( tbev ) of the flavivirus group is transmitted by the tick ies ricinus in sweden .,none of the cats developed neurological signs although histological lesions of a nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis were observed in two cats .
"tolasma gondii , the most important non - viral infectious agent causing cns disease in cats , is ruled out because of negative immunohistochemical staining for . gondii antigen , absence of tissue cysts and absence of extraneural lesions .","borrelia burgdorferi , a cause of arthritis and possibly meningitis in dogs ( greene , ) has not been reported as a cause of neurological disease in cats ."
the feline meningoencephalomyelitis of the present investigation is doubtless identical with that described by kronevi ef al .,and shows many similarities to the cases of unknown aetiology reported in switzerland by hoff and vandevelde .
"in recent years , a further outbreak of the disease was observed in the same park ( truyen et al . , ) .","attempts to isolate a virus from the cns again failed , but feline herpes virus type ( fhv - 1 ) was isolated from the tonsil of one lion ."
"the seimc considers it appropriate to produce a consensus document that will be useful to primary care physicians as well as specialists in internal medicine , infectious diseases and tropical medicine who help treat travelers returning from tropical and sub - tropical areas with infections .",tropical and subtropical countries where there is a greater risk of contracting an infectious disease are among the most frequently visited tourist destinations .
"various types of professionals ( clinicians , microbiologists , and parasitologists ) have helped produce this consensus document by evaluating the available evidence - based data in order to propose a series of key facts about individual aspects of the topic .",the first section of the document is a summary of some of the general aspects concerning the general assessment of travelers who return home with potential infections .
"regional growth was eected to be highest in asia and the pacific ( between % and %) and the americas ( between % and %) , followed by europe ( between % and %) , and africa and the middle east ( between % and %) .","familitur data showed that international tourist movements made by spaniards were million in , , 140,000 of which were to the african continent , , 000 to america ( central caribbean and south ) and , 000 to asia ."
the target population in this document is adults with infections imported after returning from international travel .,"from a medical point of view , these guidelines will be useful to primary care physicians as well as specialists in internal medicine , infectious diseases and tropical medicine who treat travelers returning from tropical and sub - tropical areas with infections ."
"a search of the pubmed database was performed using the following selection criteria : articles published between and march , in english or spanish , and limited to humans only .","general evaluation of the returned traveler with a potential infection - the need to evaluate the asymptomatic traveler - the main syndromes associated with imported infectious diseases - evaluation of the traveler with severe infectious disease - evaluation of the traveler with potentially transmissible diseases and isolation precautions main infectious syndromes in the returned traveler - acute or persistent diarrhea - fever of unknown origin - localized cutaneous lesions - respiratory infections - eosinophilia - neurological infections - urinary tract infections special characteristics of the pregnant traveler special characteristics of the immunocompromised traveler general methodology of the document a systematic review of the bibliography was performed to evaluate all data concerning the causes , diagnostic methods and therapeutic options for infections imported by travelers ."
"depending on the purpose of the trip , there are two main groups : trips for personal reasons and those undertaken for professional reasons .","with respect to duration , three types may be distinguished : short - term ( < 3 weeks ) , medium - term ( 3 weeks to months ) , and long - term ( > 3 months ) ."
"when possible , c - reactive protein and procalcitonin levels should also be requested ( a - iii ) .","the analytical determinations that should be ordered for the seriously ill patient include blood count , biochemical tests including serum transaminase , bilirubin and blood coagulation , renal function , glycemia , arterial blood gas , and an analysis of urine ."
enterotoxigenic escherichia coli ( etec ) is the most frequently identified causative agent worldwide ( a - iii ) .,most cases of acute traveler ' s diarrhea are caused by bacterial pathogens .
"in an imported dermatosis that develops slowly , cutaneous leishmaniasis , mycobacterial infection or a subcutaneous mycosis should be suspected .",histological examination and identification of the causative agent with molecular biology techniques or mass spectrometry is essential ( a - ii ) .
praziquantel should be added for cases with possible epidemiological eure to schistosomiasis ( b - iii ) .,"when the cause cannot be identified , the empiric treatment for imported eosinophilia should be a combination of oral ivermectin plus albendazole ."
"when empiric anthelmintic treatment is administered , the patient should receive clinical follow - up with monitoring of peripheral blood eosinophil counts , since some parasites , like trichuris spp .","and schistosoma spp . , have developed resistance leading to anthelmintic treatment failure ( a - ii ) ."
the course of malaria in immunocompromised patients ( especially those infected with hiv and with low cd4 + lymphocyte counts ) tends to involve more severity criteria than in non - immunocompromised individuals .,"early diagnosis and treatment is essential , therefore , if there is clinical suspicion ( a - iii ) ."
early diagnosis and treatment with ivermectin at a dose of g / kg / per day for at least days is required ( a - iii ) .,"s . stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome and disseminated strongyloidiasis are more frequently found in immunosuppressed patients ( corticotherapy , transplants , htlv - 1 coinfection ) and have very high mortality rates ."
patients with cancer are an example of how considering all people equal before epidemics could negatively affect those who are frail .,"in a report from liang and colleagues , patients with cancer living in china had worse outcomes following infection with sars - cov - 2 than the general population ."
"moreover , remote monitoring could be a good option for follow - up for patients with covid - 19 who do not require hospitalisation .","for patients with cancer who do not need such intensive therapies , homecare options should be considered , such as telemedicine and mobile health - care devices ."
hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) is a major cause of liver disease .,"however , the detailed mechanism underlying hepatocyte infection with hcv is not yet completely understood ."
the hcv structural protein includes two envelope glycoproteins e1 and e2 ; these glycoproteins form a heterodimer and mediate viral binding and entry into host cells .,"to infect a cell , hcv must first attach itself to the cell surface by interaction with specific cell surface receptors , and consequently induce conformational changes in the glycoproteins e1 and e2 and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes ."
"in addition to cause an infection , hcv can use multiple attachment factors and receptors in parallel or in succession .","since liver is the major target organ of hcv infection , the eression pattern of hcv receptors has been suggested to be liver specific or dominant within the liver ."
"lsectin shares % and % amino acid sequence identities with dc - signr and dc - sign , respectively , and has been shown to bind in vitro with mannose , glcnac , and fucose .","interestingly , lsectin can be colocalized with dc - signr on the lsecs ."
we further showed that lsectin could bind to the hcv e2 glycoprotein in a calciumdependent manner .,these results might contribute to the understandings of the complicated mechanism of hcv infection .
"lsectin , dc - signr and empty vectors ( for mock cells ) were individually transfected into nih3t3 cells , and lg / ml g418 was added after h . clones that stably eressed lsectin or dc - signr were screened , and the eression was confirmed by western blotting and fluorescence - activated cell sorter ( facs ) analysis , using anti - lsectin mouse monoclonal antibody we previously raised and anti - dc - signr antibody ( igg2b ; r & d systems ) .",lsectin and dc - signr were subcloned into the a site of the pires eression vector .
the amount of e2 antigen was quantified by elisa using anti - fc monoclonal antibody ( sigma ) .,hcv e2 was also cloned into the psectag2 / hygro vector for producing myc - tagged e2 .
"for the soluble lsectin protein inhibition eeriment , hek293t cells were transfected with pflag - cmv - lsectin .","after washing three times , the adherence of e2 was quantified by facs using anti - fc or anti - myc antibody ."
stable lsectin or dc - signr nih3t3 cells were seeded h before infection in - well plates .,"after washing three times with serum - free dmem , ll of the pseudotype retroviral particles in medium were added to the cells followed by incubation for - 5 h at c under gentle agitation every min ."
"after washing , the sera were diluted in an adhesion buffer and were allowed to incubate with the cells for h at c ; the unbound viruses were removed .",the hcv rna copies bound to the cells were measured by quantitative pcr using the hcv kit ( shenzhen pg bio - tech ) .
"since lsectin could interact with dc - signr and c 1 , which are the well - defined hcv receptors , we asked whether lsectin could interact with hcv by binding hcv e2 glycoprotein similar to the manner of dc - signr and c 1 .",nih3t3 cells stably eressing lsectin or dc - signr were generated and the eressions of these proteins on the cell surface were roughly comparable ( supplementary fig .
the binding of e2 with nih3t3 - lsectin stable transfectants was efficiently inhibited by egta and less ( fig .,"lsectin can bind to carbohydrates such as mannose , glcnac , and fucose ; this prompted us to investigate whether the interaction between the e2 glycoprotein and lsectin was influenced by these agents ."
the affinity of the hcv pseudotypes with lsectin was approximately fivefolds that of the control pseudotype particles alone ( fig .,"to evaluate whether the hcv glycoprotein binds to lsectin in the context of a viral particle , we tested the binding of the hiv pseudotype particles bearing the hcv e1 and e2 chimeras to the nih3t3 - lsectin cells ."
") , lsectin binding to hcv virions could not be inhibited by mannan ( fig .","c ) , suggesting the similarity but not identity of lsectin with dc - signr in the hcv adhesion ."
it was reported that a soluble form of e2 protein had a significant genotypespecific difference in c 1 binding assay .,"hcv can be classified into six major genotypes and further subdivided into at least subtypes , which exhibit different phenotypic properties ."
"this article discusses the pathogens associated with virus - induced wheezing illnesses during infancy and early childhood , the association of bronchiolitis during infancy with an increased risk of childhood asthma , and the association of respiratory viruses with asthma exacerbations in older children and adults .","although it is unclear whether respiratory viral infections cause asthma , observational studies have demonstrated a high rate of asthma in children with a history of severe viral lower respiratory tract infections ( lrtis ) during infancy , and viruses are associated with the majority of asthma exacerbations among both children and adults ."
"the initial rsv infection is typically the most severe , causing lower respiratory tract disease , such as bronchiolitis , in % to % of infants .","other viruses such as rhinovirus , piv , and adenovirus circulate nearly year - round with seasonal peaks of illness ."
"although , rhinovirus historically was thought to be limited to the upper respiratory tract , investigations have demonstrated that rhinovirus can infect the lower airways , is associated with infant bronchiolitis , and becomes a more dominant pathogen in wheezing illness as children get older [ 13 , .","rhinovirus , which circulates year - round with major peaks during the autumn and spring , is a leading cause of upper respiratory tract infections , and most children show evidence of having had a rhinovirus infection by age years ."
"the first descriptive studies of the viral etiology of bronchiolitis in the s through the s primarily used such detection methods as cell culture , antigen detection , and serologic testing .","kim and colleagues studied the epidemiology of rsv infection in infants and young children admitted to a children ' s hospital in washington , d . c . , from to the mid - 7 0 s and found that % of children with bronchiolitis had evidence of infection with rsv ."
acute respiratory illnesses associated with wheeze or ' ' rattly chest ' ' were classified,nasopharyngeal aspirates and detailed information were collected prospectively during acute respiratory illnesses and pcr was used to identify viral respiratory pathogens .
allander and colleagues found hbov as the sole virus isolated in approximately % ( 12 of ) of respiratory samples from children under years of age who were hospitalized with acute wheezing .,"in general , the use of sensitive molecular techniques has confirmed the major role of rsv in infant bronchiolitis , broadened the role of viruses that were previously difficult to detect by culture , and allowed for the identification of new respiratory viruses ."
"however , rhinovirus was detected more frequently in young children hospitalized for wheezing from april through november .","among children older than years , a respiratory virus was significantly more likely to be detected in children admitted for wheezing , than children without wheezing ."
"therefore , the diverse group of research investigations in this area includes case infants in whom the specific viral agents of bronchiolitis were not determined , case infants with only rsv bronchiolitis , and case infants with either rsv or non - rsv bronchiolitis .","although several early studies focused solely on rsv bronchiolitis or were conducted before routine testing for rhinovirus was available , more recent studies have used pcr to investigate the association of non - rsv bronchiolitis and subsequent wheezing ."
"though the cohort was small , the evidence from this study points to the likelihood of increased risk of asthma through age among children who have a history of severe rsv bronchiolitis during infancy .","at age years , approximately one third of children with a history of severe rsv bronchiolitis were diagnosed with asthma and these children were significantly more likely to have a diagnosis of asthma than their nonhospitalized controls ."
piippo - savolainen and colleagues also found that children hospitalized for bronchiolitis in the first years of life were more likely to have asthma in young adulthood .,"fjaerli and colleagues found that a group of children hospitalized with bronchiolitis during infancy , whether rsv - positive or rsv - negative , were more likely to be under a doctor ' s care for asthma at age , compared with a retrospectively recruited , nonhospitalized control group of children ."
"in the cohort of children enrolled at birth in the tucson children ' s respiratory study , stein and colleagues found that children with a history of rsv lrti in the first years of life were times more likely to have parental report of infrequent wheeze ( one to three episodes of wheezing in past year ) and times more likely to have frequent wheeze ( more than three episodes of wheezing in the past year ) at years , compared with infants with no lrtis in the first years of life .",these studies have allowed for the investigation of the association of viral lrti that did not require hospitalization with subsequent wheezing .
all of the children in the cohort have at least one parent with respiratory allergies or physician - diagnosed asthma .,the coast cohort is different from the tucson cohort in that it includes only children with an increased risk of developing asthma .
"these approaches include comparing the prevalence of respiratory viruses detected in asthma patients with and without acute exacerbations , and comparing virus detection in patients with asthma to that in patients without asthma in community , emergency department , or hospital settings .","in general , many studies before the use of sensitive molecular techniques detected lower rates of viral infection during acute asthma exacerbations [ 83 , , , ."
"in children with asthma , the investigators found higher rates of virus detection among those hospitalized with an exacerbation compared with those without an exacerbation in the prior weeks .","thumerelle and colleagues conducted a regional study of french children ( october , , through june , ) , aged to years ."
"the investigators found that over the study years , the average timing of the peak of asthma hospitalizations in school - age children occurred days following the return to school , with later peaks for preschool children and adults .","in a separate study , johnston and colleagues used a mathematical model to investigate the relationship between peak asthma hospitalizations in canada and the return to school ."
"a study by teichtahl and colleagues included adults admitted for asthma exacerbations and matched controls admitted for elective surgery , august to july .","viruses are important triggers of asthma exacerbations in adults , and studies using pcr have detected viruses in approximately % to % of exacerbations ( see table ) [ 89 , , ."
viral detection was positive in % of the specimens collected to weeks after hospital admission .,"in the near - fatal asthma group , % of the viruses detected were picornavirus and % were adenovirus ."
hmpv was detected in % of subjects at admission compared with % in followup .,williams and colleagues determined the prevalence of hmpv in a cohort of adults at initial enrollment during an asthma hospitalization and at follow - up months later .
"overall , there were no differences in rhinovirus positivity between the subjects with and without asthma .","however , the investigators found that participants with asthma had more frequent clinical lrtis associated with rhinovirus than did controls ( 43% versus %, respectively ) ."
epidemiologic investigations have provided valuable insight into the role of respiratory viruses in wheezing illnesses in children and adults .,"viruses are the most important cause of lrtis in infancy and early childhood , and lrtis with respiratory viral pathogens have been identified as significant risk factors for the development of early childhood asthma ."
the results showed that mutation that inactivated endoribonuclease made nsp11 lose its ability to inhibit poly ( i - induced ifn - promoter activity .,"in conclusion , our present work indicated that the endoribonuclease activity of nsp11 was essential for nsp11 to inhibit the ifn - induction ."
"however , during the coevolution with the host cells , many viruses encoded proteins that inhibited the interferon production , making it difficult for host cells to defeat viral infection ( bowie and unterholzner , ; spann et al . , ; weber et al . , ) .","then , ifn - induced the ifn - regulated genes responsible for the antiviral response ( sadler and williams , ) ."
"infection with prrsv also subjected pigs to secondary infection by bacterial and viral pathogens , which may be due to the immunosuppression induced by the virus ( feng et al . , ; mateu and diaz , ) .","since the emergence of prrsv in the united states in and in europe in , prrsv has caused one of the most economically important diseases of swine which was characterized by severe reproductive failure in sows and respiratory distress in piglets and growing pigs ( rossow , ) ."
"orf1a and orf1b could produce nonstructural proteins ( nsp1 , nsp1 , nsp2 , nsp3 , nsp4 , nsp5 , nsp6 , nsp7 , nsp7 , nsp8 , nsp9 , nsp10 , nsp11 and nap12 ) ( den boon et al . , ; fang and snijder , ) .","our previous study and others have found that prrsv suppressed ifn - production induced by poly ( i ( luo et al . , ) and that nsp1 , nsp2 and nsp11 from prrsv were the ifn antagonists ( beura et al . , ; shi et al . , ) ."
"prrsv nsp11 possessed the nidovirus uridylate - specific endoribonuclease ( nendou ) activity ( nedialkova et al . , ) , which was a major genetic marker that was unique to nidoviruses ( ivanov et al . , ) .",our present work showed that nsp11 was an interferon antagonist and the endoribonuclease activity was essential for nsp11 to inhibit the ifn - production .
"primary antibodies used for this study were anti - irf - 3 , antiserine - phosphorylated species of irf - 3 ( pirf - 3 ) ( cell signaling technology ) , anti - actin ( beijing zhongshan goldenbridge biotechnology company , china ) and anti - flag ( sigma ) .",prrsv strain bj - 4 was a kind gift from dr . hanchun yang ( china agricultural university ) .

"at the appointed time , cells were harvested and the luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system ( promega ) in microbeta trilux liquid scintillation and luminescence conters ( microbeta - 1450 ) ( wallac ) .","cells grown in - well plates were transfected in triplicate with the indicated reporter plasmid ( 200 ng ) , phrl - tk ( 80 ng ) , and eression vector ( 500 ng ) or supplied with an equivalent control vector ."
"briefly , the total protein concentration was quantified with the bradford protein assay ( biocolor bioscience & technology company , shanghai ) .","the detailed procedure for immunoblots has been described ( shi et al . , ) ."
"nedialkova ' s study showed that nsp11 from the arterivirus , eav , also had the catalytic center ( his - 126 , his - 141 and lys170 ) and mutating one of the three amino acids could abolish the endoribonuclease ( nendou ) activity ( nedialkova et al . , ) .","and site - directed mutagenesis studies showed that mutation of one of the three amino acids could abolish the nucleolytic activity ( guarino et al . , ; ivanov et al . , ) ."
these results suggested that the endoribonuclease activity of nsp11 was responsible for its inhibition to interferon induction .,"c , nsp11h129a failed to block poly ( i - induced activation of the ifn - promoter ."
and the results showed that nsp11 inhibited the phosphorylation of irf - 3 induced by poly ( i and did not influence the eression of irf - 3 ( fig .,") , but nsp1h129a could not inhibit the phosphorylation of irf - 3 induced by poly ( i ."
"and the in vitro study showed that replacement of any of the three putative catalytic residues reduced the eav nendou activity to background levels ( nedialkova et al . , ) , which was consistent with the results of inactivated endoribonuclease in other nidovirales ( guarino et al . , ; ivanov et al . , ; xu et al . , ) .","of any of the three putative catalytic residues ( his - 126 , his - 141 , or lys - 170 ) reduced plaque sizes and reduced yields of infectious progeny ( posthuma et al . , ) ."

"despite the apparently low transmissibility of hcov - emc at this stage , it may also be the beginning of another sars - like pandemic , in which there will be increasing animal - to - human and subsequent human - to - human transmission .","alternatively , these nine documented cases may just represent the tip of an iceberg , with a majority of cases remaining undetected because of mild or asymptomatic forms of infection ."

"we focus on three of these motifs , which were found to be of greatest interest to us .",subsequent filtering of this search to identify such unique combinations has provided several examples that can be used as markers to identify particular proteins within or across databases .
the primary sequence of a protein refers to an ordered string of amino acids that belong to a finite set .,"it is therefore natural to eect that the distribution of amino acids , across all protein sequences , would appear to be fixed , given no mutations over a specific period of time ."
"here we describe a procedure that , by computing the frequency of key amino acid pairs , can quickly classify large groups of proteins into functional groups .",techniques that can quickly determine significant similarities between protein sequences are valuable in predicting an unknown protein ' s function within the cell .
"as an example , we describe the distribution of select amino acid pairs within the genome of the coronavirus , tor2 , which is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) .",the goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate how these two residue motifs can be used to develop rapid methods for searching protein or genomic databases in order to locate potentially interesting or aberrant protein sequences .
"the underlying structure of a protein sequence , which is the order of the amino acids , has unique and identifiable characteristics .","as an analogy , in written english , the letter q is almost always followed by u ."
"using the entire swiss - prot database ( release number ) as the basis for our calculations , we have constructed a probability table for the occurrence of the naturally occurring amino acids ( see table ) .","in addition to the swiss - prot database , we have also included data from complete human genebank ( ncbi build number march , ) as a source for all characterized and hypothetical human protein sequences ."
"; a s ; n s is the sth protein , a i with i z q is the ith amino acid in the sequence , and n s is the length of the protein sequence a s .","for any vector b n , if there is a sequence a s in o such that b n is a segment of a s , then we can say b n occurs in o ."
( ii ) when k p ; q ; b n implies that among the amino acids in vector b n there is a decreased affinity .,"that is , the vector b n occurs more frequently than eected ."
"in this case , the order sensitivity of b n can also be reflected by the value of k p ; q ; b n and produces the following outcomes :","in a similar approach to the condition described above , we may choose q b n p p n b n , where p n b n is a permutation of b n , and p n denotes a permutation transform ."
"in cases where k p ; q ; b n m p ; q p ; q the corresponding vector b n is called dpositive , while in those cases where the opposite takes place : k p ; q ; b n m p ; q p ds p ; q the vector b n is called d - negative .","by judiciously choosing a d equal to , we obtained , two - residue , positive - pairs , and two - residue negative - pairs ( see table ) out of a total of possibilities of amino acid pairs ."
"for example , according to table , cc is an attractive motif with d , then","( 2.13 ) , the detection of a deleterious mutation based on the increased appearance of an arbitrary string of these residues becomes possible ."
"therefore , we can also use any of the remaining seven ' ' negative ' ' motifs in table to develop additional detection methods .","since both n s m and n s c are small numbers for fixed proteins , the overall number of cm pairs in most proteins should be close to zero ."
"the total number of proteins in swiss - prot is , 723 , amongst which the number satisfying n s cc is , 922 , while the total number satisfying n s cc x1 is , 801 .","in our analysis of the positive and negative two - residue pairs , we have arbitrarily chosen cc and cm as candidates with which to search the swiss - prot database ."
"however , we would eect to find about , 233 proteins having cm pairs in the swiss - prot database , based upon the amino acid frequencies given in table , which is greater than the number observed .","for human proteins in swiss - prot , the total number of proteins containing cm pairs is , and there are only proteins that satisfy n s cm x4 ( table ) ."
"if we combine these two concepts and describe them in mathematical terms , we observe that the rates q n s c = n s and q n s cc = n s c describe these two conditions , where n s , n s c and n s cc are the numbers of all amino acids , cysteine , and cc , respectively .",we can then derive we have found the following computational results based on swiss - prot database s % : 024318 ; s % : 073867 and p x t cjx t c x2 : 28245 p c .
"we observed that the total number of cc pairs within the human subset of sequences contained in genebank ( a total of , 178 proteins ) was .",this was the most complete and readily available source of human genetic sequences and should therefore provide us with an accurate representation of both cc and cm pair distributions .
"even though both cc and cm can occur in the same protein , the total number of proteins in genebank that contain both cc and cm pairs is and these pairs almost always occur at different locations in the sequence .","using the cutoff value of four cc pairs as statistically significant , we determined the probability of finding a cm pair within proteins that already contained a cc pair ( table ) ."
"using the probability distributions obtained from swiss - prot , we obtained the probability of ccm as 00005866 .","if we filter the set of proteins described above for redundant entries , we obtain a set of unique proteins that contain the ccm triplet in the human proteome ."
"we eect that this can be used to rapidly classify proteins that carry these statistically uncommon pairs , into large families .","as an example , we focused on the double - cysteine ( cc ) pair , a pair that occurred more frequently , within the swiss - prot and complete human genebank databases ."
"while the fact that extracellular proteins contain numerous cysteine residues is not new , the distribution of these cysteines into distinct cc pairs is interesting .","proteins containing the cc motifs have previously been mentioned in the literature ; however , their surprising prevalence within protein databases has not been mentioned ."
"further analysis is required to determine if these pairs have arisen due to some type of duplication event through evolution , leading to the increased stabilization of extracellular matrix proteins .","this , however , does not elain the subset of proteins that contain numerous cc pairs , with respect to the calculated probabilities ."
"the most relevant mutation would seem to come from serine to cysteine , where there are a total of four possible substitutions tct , tcc , agt , agc to either tgt or tgc .","thus , the probability of changing cys - y - met into ccm would be greater if the mutation at y occurred at the same rate as that at x . mutations to cysteine can arise from a single base substitution from phenylalanine , serine , tyrosine , arginine and glycine ."
"having developed a formal approach to the search for interesting amino acid pairs in protein sequences , we now discuss its application in the detection of specific diseases .","in our first example , we will focus on developing detection methods for the coronavirus responsible for causing severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) ."
"( iii ) the total number of the proteins in o that satisfy n s cm x1 is , 438 , of these are found in humans .",( ii ) the total number of human proteins in o that satisfy n s cc x6 is .
after examining the complete proteome the sarsassociated coronavirus we observed a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the cc and cm pairs in the sars - associated coronavirus ' genome .,"the genome of the sars - associated coronavirus contains a total of open reading frames , which code for six characterized and five uncharacterized proteins ."
"of the putative proteins , four contain either cc or cm pairs .","two large poly - proteins , gi : 29836505 and gi : 29836495 contain cc and cm pairs , as well as cc and cm pairs , respectively ."
if the presence of increased cc or cm pairs was indicative of infection by sars we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells .,"as a very specific example , this could be accomplished through the use of specific trna mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the p and a site simultaneously ."
"through this technique , we can rapidly classify large groups of proteins into families based on the occurrence of these motifs .","by analyzing affinity and anti - affinity , we developed a procedure to search out all two - and three - residue clusters within these databases ."
"beyond the simplistic view of a process exclusively dedicated to the turnover of cellular components , recent data have uncovered uneected functions for autophagy and the autophagy - related genes , such as regulation of metabolism , membrane transport and modulation of host defenses - indicating the novel frontiers lying ahead .",complex post - translational modulation of the atg ( autophagy - related ) proteins adds additional entry points for crosstalk with other cellular processes and helps define cell - type - specific regulations of autophagy .
"the word autophagy , derived from the greek word for "" self - eating "" , refers to the catabolic processes through which the cell turns over its own constituents .","the proteasome is also involved in cellular degradation , but autophagy refers only to those pathways that lead to the elimination of cytoplasmic components by delivering them into mammalian lysosomes or plant and yeast vacuoles ."
"from here , they participate ( probably together with specific snares and tethering factors ) in the orchestrated fusion of golgi - , endosome - and plasma - membrane - derived membranes to form the phagophore .","the pas has been shown to emerge from regions of the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum enriched in the phosphatidylinositol - 3 - phosphate ( ptdins3p ) - binding protein dfcp1 , which have been named omegasomes ."
"the identification of the atg proteins in autophagy was a milestone in the understanding of the importance of this process , .","autophagy has been shown to participate in physiological processes ranging from adaptation to starvation , cell differentiation and development , the degradation of aberrant structures , turnover of superfluous or damaged organelles , tumour suppression , innate and adaptive immunity , lifespan extension and cell death ."
selective autophagy relies on cargo - specific autophagy receptors that facilitate cargo sequestration into autophagosomes .,"autophagy receptors interact directly with the structure that needs to be specifically eliminated by autophagy , as well as the pool of the atg8 ( yeast homologue of mammalian lc3 ) protein family members present in the internal surface of the growing autophagosomes , ."
"atg32 and atg36 are yeast autophagy receptors for mitochondria and peroxisomes , respectively ; they are found on the surface of these organelles and seem to operate in the same way as atg19 ( refs - 18 ) .",the distribution of atg19 on the surface of the cargo and its interaction with atg8 through an lir motif allow the hermetic formation of a double - membrane vesicle around the targeted structure .
"those include the pink1 kinase , the parkin ligase and the mitochondrial outer membrane protein fundc ( all of which were linked to mitophagy , and the smurf1 ligase and the sting adaptor , which participate in the clearance of pathogens , .","however , only a handful of these molecules have been identified so far ."
"the activity of mtorc1 is stimulated by a variety of anabolic inputs , which include the energy and nutrient status of the cell as well as the presence of amino acids and growth factors .",this kinase negatively regulates autophagy by inhibiting the activity of the atg1 ( ulk1 ) complex through direct phosphorylation .
these metabolites are taken up by neurons and oxidized to generate atp .,"moreover , the neurotransmitter glutamate , released by neurons , can be retransformed into glutamine by astrocytes ."
"downstream of the ulk and the pik complexes , phosphorylation can regulate the activity of lc3 - ii .","when phosphorylated by pka or protein kinase c ( pkc ) , lc3 becomes inoperative in autophagosome formation , ."
phosphorylation of autophagy receptors also increases their affinity for binding to substrates and lc3 during selective types of autophagy .,"phosphorylation of p62 by the casein kinase favours its interaction with ubiquitinated proteins , whereas phosphorylation of optineurin by the tank - binding kinase enhances its affinity for lc3 to promote the elimination of cytosolic salmonella ."
"although ubiquitination plays an important role in the selection of the cargo targeted for destruction during selective types of autophagy , there are so far no indications that this post - translational modification occurs on atg proteins .","recently , the formation of an atg12 - atg3 conjugate though the action of atg7 and the autocatalytic activity of atg3 has been described in mammalian cells ."
"atg5 , atg7 , lc3 and atg12 are acetylated by the p300 acetyltransferase when cells are maintained in nutrient - rich media and deacetylated by sirt1 in response to starvation , an event necessary to induce autophagy , .",an initial study showed that some of the atg proteins are acetylated and an analysis of the acetylome has revealed the importance of this modification in the regulation of autophagy .
"however , although these two atg proteins are required for the generation of the pas , they seem to be unnecessary for cups formation .","in mammalian systems , this mode of secretion could elain the non - lytic release of viruses that subverts the autophagy machinery for egression or the eulsion of cellular material by autophagosomes at the late stages of reticulocyte maturation into erythrocytes ."
"interactions between tascc , lysosomes and autophagosomes could be key in coordinating cell metabolism by coupling autophagic degradation with both the synthesis and secretion of proteins .","tascclike structures have also been observed in non - senescent cells , suggesting that this mechanism for protein secretion may be widely used ."
this situation mirrors the recruitment of lc3 - ii on to phagosomes to enhance their fusion with lysosomes in phagocytic cells .,"the role of lc3 - ii and other members of the atg8 protein family in these processes probably relies on their capacities in mediating tethering or fusion of vesicular structures , and / or binding the cytoskeleton ."
autophagy as a regulator of tissue microenvironment metabolism starvation is the classical autophagy stimulus that induces the degradation of intracellular components to generate metabolites essential to maintain cell viability ( fig .,"a ) , which are used to fuel mitochondrial respiration and atp production , ."
"a recent metabolomic study has demonstrated that cells can maintain minimal levels of mitochondrial respiration to produce atp under hypoxia ( 1% oxygen ) , and these cells also display increased levels of autophagy activity and intermediates resulting from protein and lipid catabolism .","in this context , the activation of the hypoxia - responsive factor hif - 1 regulates the eression of many glycolytic enzymes and also induces mitophagy ."
"metabolites resulting from elevated autophagy and glycolysis in these fibroblasts , such as lactate , ketone bodies and amino acids , are released into the tumour microenvironment and sequestered by cancer cells to fuel the oxidative phosphorylation necessary to sustain tumour growth .","in particular , fibroblasts perform aerobic glycolysis inside tumours and display an increased eression of glycolytic enzymes , elevated hif - 1 activity , autophagy and mitophagy ."
"this emerging topic has been recently reviewed , and some of the non - autophagic functions of atg genes are shown in table .","some modules involved in autophagosome formation , such as the two conjugation systems ( atg5 - atg12 and lc3 - pe ) and the pik complex i , are recruited to the phagosomal membrane to promote the fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes during phagocytosis triggered by the engagement of toll - like receptors ."
this complex is also required for type ii ifnmediated host defense against norovirus by inhibiting the formation of its membranous replication complex .,atg5 - atg12 suppresses the type i interferon ( ifn ) production by direct association with the retinoic - acid - inducible gene i ( rig - i ) and ifn - promoter stimulator ( ips - 1 ) .
they are used to subvert clearance by participating in the formation of a vacuole containing the bacteria that promote infection .,"complexes acting upstream of the conjugation systems , such as the ulk1 complex and pik complex i , are necessary for the intracellular cycle of the bacterium brucella abortus ."
the c - terminal fragment resulting from this processing localizes to mitochondria and sensitizes cells to apoptosis .,"thus , similarly to proteins involved in apoptosis that also function beyond apoptosis , atg components , as well as other proteins involved in autophagy such as ambra1 , vps34 and p62 ( for which autophagy - independent roles are not discussed here ) , are engaged in non - autophagic functions ."
"the modulation of this process engages actin filaments and the histone deacetylase hdac6 , which are both dispensable for autophagosome maturation under starvation conditions .","for example , we still know very little about the regulation of basal autophagy , which operates under normal growing conditions ."
"for example , the human genome contains homologues of the single yeast atg8 protein , yet the role of these counterparts remains to be elucidated .","some members of this protein family , that is , gabarapl1 and gabarapl2 , were shown to participate in autophagosome closure , whereas lc3c also acts as a specific receptor during selective antibacterial autophagy ."
"not surprisingly , defects in this process are intimately associated with numerous human diseases .",the importance of autophagy in many aspects of physiology is now recognised .
"we do not propose a universal solution , but a range of dose schedules ( including zero ) which may have a more acceptable risk profile as guidance .",these debates will continue in the coming months as we learn to accommodate to the pandemic .
the three assays were highly linear over the examined range ( see the online data supplement ) .,( corresponding to pg of reverse - transcribed rna ) was used to quantitatively target the housekeeping gene b2m .
"the results confirmed the previously published data , with flj10350 and tnni1 being significantly up - regulated and pippin being significantly down - regulated ( see the online data supplement ) .","we analyzed eression of three genes that had been found , by sybr green i analyses , to be differentially eressed in patients with congenital heart defects ."
"for normalization of the target genes analyzed in the course of this study , the housekeeping gene b2m was simultaneously assayed with the genes of interest .","the obvious sample - to - sample variations ( see the online data supplement ) stress the importance of effective systems for normalization , as achieved with the multiplexed cr - realtime pcr assay ."
forty - eight pairs of primers were designed to facilitate direct sequencing of ace2 regions spanning all of the snps .,buffy coat dna was extracted according to the blood and body fluid spin protocol in manufacturer ' s instructions for the qiaamp dna blood mini kit ( qiagen ) .
"when we used the allele frequencies obtained from the control group , the group sample size provided a power of at least % for the determination of a genetic factor that contributes % increased likelihood toward the development of sars or poor outcome with % confidence .","statistical significance among groups was examined by the test for each snp locus ( sigmastat , ver ."
"we therefore conclude that although ace2 serves functionally as the receptor for entry of the sars coronavirus into human host cells , the evidence provided by this study does not support an association between its common genetic variants and sars susceptibility or outcome .","despite its x - chromosome location , poor outcomes in male sars patients do not appear to be related to genetic variants of ace2 ."
the aspecific stimulation of the excretion of anti - rotavirus antibodies in the milk after inoculation of the only adjuvant fraction of the vaccine is confirmed .,"the excretion level , however , was significantly lower than after rotavirus vaccination ."
"on this basis , a growing number of diverse bh3 - only proteins are being reported .","while compelling cell biological and biophysical evidence validates many bh3 - only proteins , claims about significant bh3 sequence similarity are often unfounded ."
"however , past evolution of a protein family , such as the bcl - 2 family of apoptosis regulators , is protohistorically recorded in the genomes of present - day cells .",the lack of ancestral sequences is only one of many obstacles to tracing the evolutionary history of genes and their cellular processes .
"despite limitations , comparisons across species have catapulted forward our understanding of biological processes , exemplified by bcl - 2 family proteins .","thus , cross - species comparisons need to be captured and understood to broaden our biological knowledge of bcl - 2 family members and their central roles in normal development and in cancer ."

"three - dimensional structures have been determined for many bcl - 2 family members , revealing a series of approximately alpha helices with a central helical hairpin .","to determine cell fate in response to a wide range of environmental and internal stresses , anti - and pro - death bcl - 2 family members interact in a regulated series of events and conformational changes , the details of which are actively being pursued ."

"there may be other cases where divergence accumulated over evolutionary time scales , producing proteins that will exhibit similarities only in this short region .","conversely , the lack of verifiable sequence similarity using currently available bioinformatics does not negate the potential importance of bh3 - like motifs in biology ."
"furthermore , sequence similarity of bh3 is not sufficient to automatically infer common ancestral origins ( see box ) .","by contrast to the structurally defined bcl - 2 protein fold , which forms a single protein domain ( helical bundle ) , individual bh motifs do not constitute separate protein domains ."
"moreover , because d - structure evolves more slowly than sequence , remote homologs may be found among canonical / other bh3 - containing proteins as more protein structures are solved .","this scenario does not exclude the possibility of divergent evolution in some instances , such as between the bh3 - coding ens of the pro - apoptotic bcl - 2 homolog bak and the bh3 - only protein bik , as we previously hypothesized ."
"indeed , interacting proteins are known to evolve and co - evolve in a lineage - specific manner , and interacting proteins often display similar evolutionary histories ( see box ) .",in the meantime we can only attempt to avoid a mammalian - centric perspective .
"alternatively , bcl - 2 proteins could act on lipid membranes , such as changing membrane curvature in a manner that does not require specific interactions with foreign proteins .",ectopically eressed mammalian bcl - 2 proteins may use different mechanisms to modulate cell survival / death in yeast by acting on distinct effector proteins .
"these findings destabilize the idea of ced - 9 being a prototypical multi - bh protein , and that simpler metazoans are necessarily less equipped than complex ones .","the decoded genome sequences of the sponge a . queenslandica , the cnidarians n . vectensis and h . vulgaris , the echinodermate s . purpuratus , the urochordate c . intestinalis and the cephalochordate b . floridae revealed that these "" early - branching "" metazoan species have a large and unique set of bcl - 2 homologs ."
"sequence analyses indicate that bcl - 2 family proteins consist of three clades ( bcl - 2 - like , bax - like and bid - like ) that share d structural folds and common ancestry despite lacking bh motifs , and a fourth fast - growing group of phylogenetically unrelated proteins with limited sequence similarity in the bh3 motif .","the examples presented here illustrate the difficulty in interpreting functional versus phylogenetic similarities of the diverse bh3 sequence motifs reported to date , and in handling the potential huge number of predicted bh3 - containing proteins ."
"our eerience with building hmm profiles with bh3 - like proteins invariably leads to profile drift in iterated searches , indicating that these sequences collectively contribute noise .","this method identified a bh3 in pxt1 ( q8k459 ) , but the assigned bh3 pfam domain is untraceable and may not exist , and the other hmm study provided no details regarding the bioinformatic approaches ."
"while previously reported bh3 search strategies potentially narrow the list of candidates somewhat , there is little certainty of this .","definitive bioinformatic procedures that reliably predict new bh3 - containing proteins are currently lacking ( see box ) , and new improved methods are needed ."

"background chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) , lung cancer , and tuberculosis are three leading causes of death in china , where prevalences of smoking and solid - fuel use are also high .","we aimed to predict the eff ects of risk - factor trends on copd , lung cancer , and tuberculosis ."
we obtained the aetiological eff ects of risk factors on diseases from meta - analyses of epidemiological studies and from large studies in china .,"we modelled future copd and lung cancer mortality and tuberculosis incidence , taking into account the accumulation of hazardous eff ects of risk factors on copd and lung cancer over time , and dependency of the risk of tuberculosis infection on the prevalence of disease ."
"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) , lung cancer , and tuberculosis are the second , sixth , and eighth leading causes of death in china , accounting for almost million deaths in ( 20 % of all deaths in china ) .","a half of chinese men smoke and more than % of chinese households use solid fuels , such as wood , crop residues , and coal for heating and cooking ."
we provide a systematic assessment of the future trends of these three leading communicable and non - communicable respiratory diseases in china that share smoking and indoor air pollution as risk factors .,these results quantify the potential benefi ts of programmes that target one or more of these risk factors or disease outcomes .
"individuals in the slowly progressive latent state or the recovered state are at risk of reinfection , although prior infection confers partial immunity .",individuals in the infectious state can be treated and enter the recovered ( r ) state from which they remain at risk of relapse to active disease .
the incidence of tuberculosis depends on risk - factor eure and population prevalence of infectious cases .,"we used a dynamic tuberculosis transmission model , specifi cally the deterministic compartmental susceptiblelatent - infectious - recovered model ( fi gure ) , described in detail elsewhere ."
"we present results for provinces that span a range of characteristics : jiangsu , a province with moderate historical prevalence of tuberculosis and representative historical trend in prevalence compared to other provinces and guizhou and shanghai which have prevalences and trends that diff er from other provinces ( webfi gure ) .","to account for heterogeneity across provinces , we did tuberculsosis analyses at the provincial level ."
"similar to large rise in female smoking with a lower peak , as seen for example in japan ; this is an ideal scenario , included to provide a theoretical upper - bound on the benefi ts of gradual smoking reduction over the projection period see webfi gure for prevalence over time .",we used china data online for data on provincial populations .
"china has implemented an ambitious programme to disseminate improved cooking stoves , , primarily to improve effi ciency and reduce fuel use .",solid - fuel scenarios only encompass fuel changes and did not take into account alternative stoves .
"the coal share of solid fuel remains at its level given the past trends in biomass to coal conversion , and its policy drivers , this is the lowest bound for coal share of solid fuels see webfi gure for fuel - use over time .","if alternative stove designs reduce eure signifi cantly , they can be treated as equivalent to fuel change ; partial eure reduction can be modelled with eff ect sizes between those for solid fuels and clean fuels ."
the same solid - fuel scenarios were used for men and women but the relative risk is higher for women ( table ) the national change in relative proportion of urban and rural population over time was applied to all provinces .,the proportion of diff erent categories of solid - fuel use in future scenarios were calculated such that transitions from coal and biomass to clean fuels in any year were proportional to their prevalence in the year of transition .
"china made signifi cant progress in dots eansion between and in provinces , municipalities , and autonomous regions .","after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , china further eanded dots coverage so that nationally an estimated % of smear - positive cases of tuberculosis were detected and treated in ."
"low relative risks have also been observed in other asian populations , which likewise began smoking late .","because the deaths in the proportional mortality study occurred in - 88 , around the peak of the smoking epidemic in china , , relative risks for copd and lung cancer were substantially lower than in populations in europe and the usa , which have smoked longer ."
"for smoking and latent infection , we used the pooled estimate from a recent meta - analysis , which had relative risks for disease similar to other published meta - analyses .",", the relative risk for progression to active tuberculosis was obtained by dividing that for smoking and active tuberculosis from the only cohort study relative risk in the only study of smoking and active disease among people who were latently infected ."
"the sponsor of the study had no role in study design , data collection , data analysis , data interpretation or writing of the report .",the corresponding author had full access to all data in the study and had fi nal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication .
"at the population level , with moderate tobacco control , the sum of the annual avoided copd and lung cancer deaths among men would be an estimated and million , respectively , % of all projected deaths of men from these diseases ( webfi gure ) .","if tobacco control is aggressive , with smoking in men declining to % by , million copd deaths and million lung cancer deaths would be averted ."
"conversely , if female smoking rises to % by , an additional million copd deaths and million lung cancer deaths are eected among chinese women .",this asymmetry of benefi ts and harms occurs because the relative risks seem to rise slowly among new smokers but fall steeply in former smokers ( webfi gure ) .
the benefi ts would be twice as large with a complete transition to clean fuels .,"proportionally , more deaths are prevented among women because they are closer to the pollution source during cooking , have higher eure to pollutants , and hence higher relative risks ."
"nonetheless , reducing smoking and solid fuels would further reduce incidence of tuberculosis from projected levels .","after accounting for the overlap between the eff ects of the two risk factors , if smoking and solid - fuel use are if there is sustained % coverage of eff ective dots ( webtable ) , the annual incidence of infectious tuberculosis in the three provinces presented here is estimated to decline after , even if smoking and solid - fuel use remain at their current levels ( fi gure ) ."
"the decline in incidence in these three provinces will be - 28% less under moderate dots than under optimum dots , and - 79% smaller under minimum dots .",incidence of tuberculosis is projected to decline even when dots implementation is less eff ective .
reductions in smoking and solid - fuel use can signifi cantly reduce the burden of copd and lung cancer .,"moderate , aggressive , and complete reduction of these eures over the next three decades , through mechanisms such as tobacco taxation , advertising ban , and fuel pricing , can lead to - 38% reduction in deaths from these two diseases , which have few other eff ective treatments ."
current and projected mortality from copd and lung cancer from the global burden of disease analysis used chinese mortality data sources and accounted for demographic and socioeconomic development .,the relative risks and how they change over time were based on meta - analyses and large high - quality epidemiological studies in china and elsewhere .
benefi ts of tobacco control in diff erent scenarios would be - 81% smaller for men and - 94% smaller for women if the relative risks for eff ects of smoking on copd and lung cancer do not rise signifi cantly after the peak of the smoking epidemic ( webfi gure ) .,"one recent study in china is consistent with increasing relative risks , but the possibility of ethnic diff erences cannot be ruled out ."
"if the causal eff ect on tuberculosis were only from smoking , the benefi ts of reducing eure would be smaller than those in fi gure , by - 37% for diff erent scenarios in jiangsu , by - 32% in guizhou , and by - 13% in shanghai .","in addition to the above sources of uncertainty , fundamentally new technologies for early detection and treatment of chronic diseases could signifi cantly aff ect future burden ."
"in addition to their disease burden , these diseases have large and inequitable household and societal economic burden associated with health - care costs , reduced labour - market participation , and decreased accumulation of human capital , described in detail elsewhere for china and for other developing countries .","our results show that reducing common risk factors could have a substantial eff ect on future burden of copd and lung cancer , and be an important contributor to tuberculosis control ."

"whereas the sars - cov outbreak was contained within months , mers cases continue to occur years after the emergence of mers - cov in the human population .","currently , dromedary camels are suspected to be one of the direct reservoirs for the zoonotic transmission of mers - cov , although the exact chain of transmission remains to be elored in more detail ."
"the mers - cov pl pro domain , which resides in nsp3 , has recently been confirmed to recognize and cleave after the sequence lxgg at the nsp122 and nsp223 junctions , as defined previously for other cov pl pro s , as well as an ixgg sequence , which constitutes the nsp324 cleavage site .","comparative sequence analysis of the mers - cov genome and proteome allowed for the prediction and annotation of nsps , along with the location of the probable proteolytic cleavage sites ."
"the best - studied linkages are the ones occurring at lys of ub , which results in the targeting of the tagged substrate to the s proteasome for degradation , and at lys , which generates a scaffold for the recruitment of cellular proteins to activate numerous signaling cascades , including critical antiviral and proinflammatory pathways .",additional ub molecules can be linked to any of the lysine residues in ub itself or to its n terminus to generate polyubiquitin ( poly - ub ) chains of various linkage types .
"viral rna molecules are recognized by pattern recognition receptors , such as the cytoplasmic rig - i - like receptors ( rlrs ) rig - i and mda5 , which are activated by intracellular viral rna transcripts bearing tri - and diphosphates and double - stranded rna ( dsrna ) replication intermediates , respectively .","upon their stimulation , rlrs signal through the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein ( mavs ) , leading to the formation of a signaling complex at the mitochondrial membrane and ultimately to the activation of transcription factors irf - 3 and nf - b ."
"similarly , mers - cov infection has been found to elicit a poor type - 1 ifn response in cultured monocyte - derived dendritic cells and alveolar epithelial a549 cells as well as ex vivo in bronchial and lung tissue samples .","previous work has shown that during infection , sars - cov indeed suppresses the host ' s antiviral responses by preventing the induction of ifn - eression in cell culture ."
"using this approach , we were able to remove the dub activity from pl pro without affecting its ability to cleave the nsp324 cleavage site in trans .","based on the structure of this complex , mutations were introduced that selectively disrupted ub recognition by targeting regions of the ub - binding site on pl pro that were sufficiently distant from the active site of the protease ."
"as secondary antibodies , horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) - conjugated antibodies were used ( p0447 and p0217 ; dako ) .","primary antibodies used were mouse anti - ha ( ab18181 ; abcam ) , mouse anti - v5 ( 37 - 7500 ; invitrogen ) , mouse anti - actin ( a5316 ; sigma - aldrich ) , mouse anti - flag ( f3165 ; sigma - aldrich ) , and rabbit anti - gfp ."
"recombinant eression plasmid ( pe - sumo - pl pro ) was isolated from a single colony , and dna sequencing confirmed the eected sequence of the pl pro domain and the in - frame fusion of the - end to a sequence encoding a his - sumo purification tag , which facilitated purification of the product by immobilized metal ( nickel ) affinity chromatography as described below .","using standard methodologies , the sequence encoding amino acids of mers - cov pp1a / pp1ab was pcramplified , cloned downstream of the t7 promoter of eression vector pe - sumo ( lifesensors ) , and used to transform escherichia coli bl21 ( de3 ) gold cells ( stratagene ) grown under kanamycin selection ( 35 g / ml ) ."
"the cells were pelleted , resuspended in lysis buffer ( 20 mm hepes , ph , mm nacl , % ( v / v ) glycerol , and mg / ml lysozyme ) , and lysed for h at c , followed by sonication .","the lysate was clarified by centri - fugation at , 000 g for min at c , and the soluble fraction was applied to talon resin ( ge healthcare ) pre - equilibrated with lysis buffer ."
sds - polyacrylamide gels were stained with coomassie brilliant blue ( sigma - aldrich ) and scanned using a gs - 800 calibrated densitometer ( bio - rad ) .,"after a - h incubation at c , the reaction was stopped by the addition of laemmli sample buffer ( 4 lsb ; mm tris , % sds , % glycerol , 2% bromphenol blue , mm dtt , ph ) ."
eression and purification of mers - cov pl pro for crystallization - e . coli bl21 ( de3 ) gold cells harboring pe - sumo - pl pro were grown at c with aeration in ml of lysogeny broth containing kanamycin ( 35 g / ml ) to an a of .,eression of the his - sumo - pl pro fusion protein was then induced by the addition mm isopropyl - d - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside for h at c with aeration .
"cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation ( 17,211 g at c ) , and the supernatant containing the his - sumo - pl pro fusion was applied to a column containing nickelnitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin ( qiagen ) .","cell pellets were resuspended in ice - cold lysis buffer ( 150 mm tris , ph , m nacl , mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride ( pmsf ) , mm dtt ) and lysed using a french pressure cell ( aminco ) ."
"crystals of unliganded pl pro were also grown using the vapor diffusion method in % peg , m trisodium citrate , ph , % isopropyl alcohol after concentrating the protein to mg / ml .","crystallization of pl pro and pl pro ub complexes - the purified pl pro ub complex was concentrated and crystallized at c in two different conditions using the vapor diffusion method : ) % peg , m trisodium citrate , ph , % isopropyl alcohol at mg / ml , which yielded the structure of open pl pro ub ( see "" results "" ) , and ) 0 m ammonium sulfate ( amso ) at mg / ml , which yielded the structure of closed pl pro ub ( see "" results "" ) ."
"in preparation for x - ray data collection , single crystals of open pl pro ub from condition above were briefly swept through a droplet of cryoprotectant composed of % peg , m trisodium citrate , ph , % , 2 - propanediol before flash cooling in liquid nitrogen .","similarly , single crystals of closed pl pro ub from condition above and unbound pl pro were cryoprotected in 5 m amso , % glycerol and % peg , m trisodium citrate , ph , % , 2 - propanediol , respectively , before flash cooling in liquid nitrogen ."
firefly and renilla luciferase activity was measured using the dual - luciferase reporter assay system ( promega ) on a mithras lb multimode reader ( berthold technologies ) .,eeriments were performed in triplicate and independently repeated at least four times .
dub activity of purified recombinant mers - cov pl pro was also demonstrated using ub - 7 - amino - 4 - trifluoromethylcoumarin or ub - 7am ino - 4 - methylcoumarin as a substrate .,"to characterize the direct activity of recombinant mers - cov pl pro toward poly - ub , we purified the enzyme from e . coli and incubated it with either lys - or lys - linked poly - ub chains ."
the packing of the palm and thumb domains forms a cleft leading into the active site in a manner consistent with the domain organization prototyped by the clan ca group of cysteine proteases .,"the ubl domain packs against the thumb domain composed of helices - 7 , which in turn packs against the palm domain composed of strands , , and ."
"in addition , in the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus usp domain pl1 pro , a structurally analogous bl2 loop was found to be in an open conformation with poorly defined electron density in the absence of substrate .","the sars - cov pl pro domain has also been crystallized both in the presence and absence of ub , and although the bl2 loop of unbound sars - cov pl pro was resolved in two of three monomers of the asymmetric unit , the third showed weak electron density for bl2 and high temperature factors , indicating a high degree of mobility ."
"pl pro residues interacting directly with ub were replaced with larger , bulkier residues that would prevent ub binding by altering both shape and surface electrostatics of the ub - binding site .","individual mutation of eight different pl pro residues ( arg , thr , ala , asn , val , val , val , and gln ) and combinations thereof were generated ( fig ."
processing of ha - nsp3c - 4 - v5 in trans by wild - type pl pro and our panel of mutants was visualized via western blotting ( fig .,"we assume that the successful processing of the nsp324 site in ha - nsp3c - 4 - v5 is indicative of unaltered proteolytic cleavage capability of pl pro , which during infection facilitates the release of nsp1 , , and from the viral polyproteins ."
we therefore designed luciferase - based reporter gene assays to establish whether the dub activity of mers - cov pl pro alone suffices to antagonize the ifn - pathway .,"mers - cov pl pro is thought to possess these properties based on its capability to inhibit rig - i - , mda5 - , and mavs - induced ifn - promoter stimulation and to reduce tnf - - induced nf - b reporter gene activity ."
the inhibitory effect of the pl pro variants on the activation of the ifn - promotor by the different stimuli was measured via co - eression of a firefly luciferase reporter gene under control of the ifn - promoter .,another co - transfected plasmid encoding renilla luciferase was included as an internal control in order to be able to correct for variability in transfection efficiency .
"it should , however , be noted that the a1656r mutant was also impaired in cleaving the nsp324 site , and therefore this mutation nonspecifically disrupted the two proteolytic functions of pl pro .","strikingly , each mutant containing the v1691r substitution was completely unable to inhibit ifn - promoter activation , resulting in relative luciferase activity levels similar to those seen with the active site mutant ( fig ."
"taken together , our data show that the dub activity of mers - cov pl pro suffices to efficiently suppress mavs - induced ifn - promoter activation and that this activity can be selectively disabled , without disrupting protease activity toward the nsp324 cleavage site , by targeting the ub - binding site of the enzyme .",this demonstrates for the first time that the dub activity of mers - cov pl pro is specifically responsible for suppressing the innate immune response .
"in addition , our results demonstrate that the majority of the mutations within the s1 ub - binding site of pl pro that were tested do not affect trans cleavage of the nsp324 junction , with the exception of an a1656r mutant that did disrupt cleavage of the nsp324 site .","particularly , the substitution of val with the bulky and charged arginine residue severely impaired dub activity in our cell culture - based assays ."
"ultimately , these effects need to be studied in the context of a viral infection ; however , a simple inactivation of the protease / dub would not only fail to prove the specific involvement of the dub activity , it would also prevent viral replication .","some of these dubs , specifically those found in rna viruses , are also critical for viral replication by catalyzing the proteolytic cleavage of specific sites in viral polyproteins , thus complicating our ability to study the direct effects of the additional dub activity of these viral proteases ."
"it has been suggested that sars - cov pl pro may recognize lys - linked di - ub via its s1 and s2 sites , although to date , no crystal structures have been reported of sars - cov pl pro in complex with a di - ub substrate .","in contrast , sars - cov pl pro rapidly cleaves lys - linked poly - ub and displays only moderate activity for lys linkages in similar assays ."
such a highly organized structure can also be formed in tertiary lymphoid organs ( tlos ) at sites of infection or chronic immune stimulation .,"the lymph nodes ( lns ) and spleen have an optimal structure that allows the interaction between t cells , b cells and antigen - presenting dendritic cells ( dcs ) on a matrix made up by stromal cells ."
"second , they allow entry of antigen - loaded dendritic cells ( dcs ) and other innate immune cells .","first , they filter lymph or blood and sample the antigens in these fluids ."
"various terms , such as ectopic lymphoid tissue , lymphoid tissue neogenesis and tlos , have been used to describe the occurrence of these organized structures .","sometimes , the chronic infiltrate organizes into distinct t and b cell - rich aggregates ."
it is becoming clear that these structures could have similar yet distinct functions in the induction and maintenance of adaptive immune responses .,"in this review , we first describe the molecular and cellular signals that lead to development of tlo structures in several disease models ."
lto cells develop further into follicular dcs ( fdcs ) and fibroblast reticular cells ( frcs ) that provide the conduit framework on which t and b cells migrate and interact with each other .,"in addition , production of lymphangiogenetic growth factors , such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) - c , vegf - d , fibroblast growth factor ( fgf ) - 2 and hepatocyte growth factor ( hgf ) , leads to formation of lyve - 1 + lymphatic vessels ."
"together , these studies have highlighted the importance of interactions between hematopoietic cells and stromal cells , and between lta1b2 signaling and homeostatic chemokines in the complex organization of slos .",recent insights indicate that signals derived from the nervous system could provide this first signal for ln development .
"given this , it has been suggested that inflammation - induced tlos might have developed during evolution before slos did .",together these data illustrate that homeostatic chemokines and cytokines are sufficient and necessary for the induction of tlos .
"second , lti cells have been observed in models of spontaneous tlo development , such as the perivascular tlos seen in hypercholesterolemic apoe - / mice and the ibalt structures seen in neonatal lungs eed to lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) .","human tlos , such as those seen in ipah , also contain adult lti - like cells that are cd4 - , ckit + and ox 4 0 l positive , and also eress rorc"
rip or the intestine - specific villin promoter driving eression of cxcl13 ) and transgenic overeression of il - 7 both result in increased numbers of lti cells and dependence of tlo formation on lti cells .,"however , in these systems , lymphoid organogenesis starts before birth , which means that the requirement for lti cells in induction of tlo formation could be overestimated ."
"( b ) as in slos , tlos are divided into discrete b and t cell areas .","although , fully formed tlo structures often contain only a single t cell area and a larger b cell area , in which gc reactions can be seen ."
"lti cells , b cells , t cells and dcs remain candidate cell types , with an emerging role for th17 cells .","overall , there is no strong evidence pointing towards one specialized lti cell type in tlo induction ."
"it has been elegantly demonstrated that inflammation can induce this program of myofibroblast differentiation in tissue - resident fibroblasts , while at the same time inducing the production of the homeostatic chemokines cxcl13 and ccl21 , and lymphangiogenic cytokines .","several studies have suggested that lto and frc cells of the t cell zone , like myofibroblasts , stain positive for a - smooth muscle actin and produce desmin ."
"they are also an important source of vegf - c , which induces lymphangiogenesis .",tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) a and eress surface molecules ( cd40l ) that could help in structuring tlos .
"in conclusion , tlo formation follows the same basic set of rules also implicated in formation of lns and peyer ' s patches ( figure ) .","controversies remain on the precise nature of the lti cell , and how it communicates with lto cells ."
"although the deeper lung was once considered sterile , there is now evidence that it is not ; particularly following viral infection or chronic cigarette smoking , typical triggers of tlo formation in the lung .","isolated lymphoid follicles ( ilfs ) are a specialized type of tlo that forms postnatally in the intestinal wall , through epithelial recognition of nucleotide - binding oligomerization domain - containing protein ( nod1 ) ligands derived from commensals ."
it is also possible that the remodeling around blood vessels and the subepithelial areas leads to formation of a conduit system that provides a path for the encountered antigens to reach the tlo .,"in many instances , the tlos are found immediately next to lymphatics , but no study so far has been able to determine if these lymphatics are afferent ( bringing antigen to the tlo ) or efferent ( erting lymphocytes ) ."
"almost all tlos described exhibit signs of b cell class switching , as exemplified by the presence of high amounts of the activationinduced cytidine deaminase ( aid ) enzyme and the presence of gc reactions .",a major constituent of tlos are the b cells that accumulate on the fdc network .
"in a model of influenza , for t cell immunity to persist , there is continued dependency on lung dcs that take viral antigens from the lung to the mediastinal lns , even long after the virus has been cleared , for presentation to memory t cells .",it is not known why some infections leave behind a tlo structure whereas others do not .
more severe pathology of the grey matter and earlier onset of disease has been noticed in cases of autoimmune encephalomyelitis in which ectopic b cell follicles are present .,"the eansion of b cells inside an individual tlo around islets is often oligoclonal , suggesting the presence of an autoantigen ."
"strikingly , the disease was also prevented by treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins ( ivigs ) to saturate fc receptors on effector cells .",this finding shows that these tlos contribute to immunopathology via a humoral mechanism .
tlos have also been found in the meninges of patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis ; a severe feature of sle .,"notably , all meningeal b cell follicles are found in cerebral sulci adjacent to large subpial cortical lesions , suggesting that soluble factors diffusing from these structures have a pathogenic role ."
"although it has been proposed that there is an autoimmune component in many chronic tissue - destructive diseases such as copd , another elanation could be colonization of the lung by latent adenovirus or unsuspected commensals in the lung .","until we know the antigen - specificity of the b and t cell responses in tlos , we can only speculate on the nature of the antigens presented in diseases such as ipah and primary biliary sclerosis ."
"treatment with pcn significantly increases survival , enhances viral clearance , accelerates induction of virus - specific antibody production , and significantly decreases morbidity and lung damage ; these changes have been attributed to prior development of ibalt .","absence of any specific viral antigens are protected against both sublethal and lethal doses of two different influenza viruses , a mouse - adapted sars - coronavirus , and a mouse pneumovirus ."
"in a model of diabetes in nod mice , neutralization of cxcl13 leads to disorganized tlos , yet there is no clear effect on diabetes incidence .","clearly , more preclinical studies on these compounds are needed before we can envisage an intervention study in humans ."
the formation of these structures follows the same basic rules and involves the same cell types that also control the formation of slos .,"given the fact that the function of tlos is similar to that of slos , the basic question for the field is why exactly our defense system mounts this , at first sight , redundant response ."

recent data indicate that the hiv - 1 quasispecies that arise following a mucosal infection are usually derived from a single transmitted virus .,"moreover , the finding that the first effective immune responses drive the selection of virus escape mutations provides insight into the earliest immune responses against the transmitted virus and their contributions to the control of acute viraemia ."
"this has advanced our understanding of the nature of the transmitted virus and the first immune responses in the period before establishment of stable viraemia ( the viral set point ) , which occurs - 6 months after infection .","recent advances that enable the identification of patients within the first few weeks of hiv - 1 infection , 2 have provided researchers access to samples from acutely infected patients earlier and in higher numbers than previously available ."
"in this review , we focus our discussion on the early host or viral factors that are crucial for determining the outcome of hiv - 1 infection .","these include the nature of the transmitted virus , or founder virus , suppression of the initial infection by genetically influenced"
"in addition , we review what is known about the nature of innate and adaptive immune responses during this early phase of infection , drawn from studies of humans and macaques infected with hiv - 1 and simian immunodeficiency virus ( siv ) , respectively .","immune responses , and the rate of virus mutation and viral fitness of selected mutants ."
"it is still uncertain whether hiv - 1 is transmitted as a free or a cell - bound virus , but siv can be transmitted in either form .","in addition , the mechanism by which hiv - 1 crosses the genital mucosal epithelium is unclear ."
virus replication at this focus might in fact be supported by early innate immune responses that lead to the recruitment of additional susceptible t cells to the site .,homogeneity of the founder virus indicates that the established infection probably arises from a single focus of infected mucosal cd4 + t cells .
"up to % of uninfected cd4 + t cells at this site become activated and die by apoptosis , resulting in the release of apoptotic microparticles that can suppress immune function .","therefore , % of cd4 + t cells in the galt can be depleted in the first weeks of hiv - 1 infection , , ."
"virus diversification occurs during this decrease in viral load , and multiple escape mutants are selected under the pressure of adaptive immune responses that are first detectable just before peak viraemia - 33 .","in the absence of antiretroviral drug therapy ( art ) , the set point is maintained by a balance between virus turnover and the immune responses ."
"chronic immune activation is not observed in naturally siv - infected sooty mangabeys , in which the infections rarely progress to aids .","this is despite high levels of virus replication and acute cd4 + t cell depletion , suggesting a role for immune activation in aids development ."
"similar virus vector - based vaccines have been shown to stimulate simian immunodeficiency virus ( siv ) - specific c + t cell responses in rhesus macaques , and an adenovirus serotype vector eressing gag protected against challenge with a chimeric siv - hiv ( shiv89 . 6 p ) virus but was not protective against challenge with the more natural sivmac239 ( ref .","the step vaccine , comprised of three recombinant attenuated adenovirus serotype viruses eressing hiv - 1 gag , pol and nef , stimulated c + t cell responses to the viral proteins but again showed no protective effect , ."
the volunteer cohort was low risk ( annual incidence of infection ~ 0.3% ) and this may be relevant as it may be easier to protect such people than those at high risk .,"this showed for the first time a small protective effect , with % fewer vaccine recipients becoming infected with hiv - 1 than controls ; the result was statistically significant in one of the three analyses made ."
"it will also be important to understand why broad - specificity , neutralizing antibodies are not routinely induced and to determine ways to safely induce them , and to identify what immune responses lead to a better outcome - as in the rare individuals , known as ' elite controllers ' , who successfully control hiv - 1 infection for decades without needing antiretroviral drug therapy , .",there is a general consensus in the field that future vaccine approaches should be less empirical and that a deeper understanding of the earliest immune responses to hiv - 1 and siv infection is needed .
"in contrast to other pathogens that have infected and selected humans for millennia , hiv - 1 is a new pathogen to humans .","therefore , the influence of the host ' s genetics on the immune response to hiv - 1 infection may be more evident ."
"it is possible that kir3ds1 mediates specific recognition of hiv - infected cells by nk cells , although the exact nature of the ligand is elusive .","these observations probably reflect an influence of interactions between kir3ds1 and / or kir3dl1 and hla - b bw4 ile on the development and / or functions of nk cells , and possibly c + t cells , which may help to control viral set point ."
"the first detectable innate immune response , occurring sometimes just before t , was an increase in the levels of some acute - phase proteins , such as serum amyloid a ( h . kramer and b . kessler , personal communication ) .",a further wave of acute - phase protein production coincided with a cytokine response ( described below ) and a rapid increase in plasma viraemia .
"levels of il - 15 , type i interferons ( ifns ) and cxc - chemokine ligand ( cxcl10 ) increase rapidly but transiently .","il - 18 , tnf , ifn and il - 22 also increase rapidly but are sustained at high levels , whereas the increase in il - 10 is slightly delayed ( fig ."
"high - level systemic cytokine responses during acute infections with avian influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus are likewise associated with immunopathological consequences , .",the intense cytokine response in acute hiv infection may instead fuel viral replication and mediate immunopathology ( discussed below ) .
"dcs are markedly reduced in number during acute hiv - 1 infection ( n . bhardwaj and p . b . , unpublished observations ) .","this rapid decline in circulating dcs , particularly plasmacytoid dcs ( pdcs ) , may be due to activation - induced cell death or to the migration of activated dcs into lymph nodes , where an increase in dc numbers is observed , ."
the nk cell population eressing kir3ds1 and / or kir3dl1 eands during acute infection in individuals that also eress hla - b bw4 ile .,nk and nkt cells can control hiv replication through cytolysis of virally infected cells and the production of antiviral cytokines and chemokines .
"because nk cells share some characteristics with memory cells after their initial activation , , it may be possible to prime their antiviral activity through vaccination .",can the protective potential of innate immune responses be harnessed by vaccination ?
"similar to siv infection in macaques , the first t cell responses to hiv - 1 infection arise as viraemia approaches its peak , and the t cell response peaks - 2 weeks later , as viraemia declines .","a few studies have measured hiv - 1 - specific c + t cell responses during early hiv - 1 infection , before the first antibodies are detectable , 31,33 , 81 ( fiebig stages i or ii ) ."
"notably , t cell - and antibody - mediated selection of viral escape mutants rarely involved a single amino acid change in the epitope ; most mutants involved multiple changes such that various mutants were ' tested ' until the fittest were selected .",a minority of virus escape mutants were not associated with demonstrable t cell responses : a few mutations were probably reversions from the sequence of the transmitted virus that was selected by t cells in the patient ' s sexual partner ; others may have been selected by antibody - dependent cell - mediated virus inhibition or by nk cells .
"often , the first t cell responses decline rapidly when the escape mutations are selected , or they may decline through exhaustion , .","responses to other viral proteins , including the conserved gag p24 and pol proteins , tended to arise during later waves of t cell responses and may be more important for maintaining the viral load at the set point than for controlling early viraemia , , ."
"therefore , c + t cells curb viraemia in acute hiv - 1 infection .","as a virus - infected cell has a lifespan of day in vivo , this means that - 35% of infected cells must be killed prematurely by a single t cell response , which must reduce virus production ."
"the time it takes for the first t cell responses to become targeted to conserved epitopes might be important in determining long - term control of viral infection , , .","it is not clear what features determine which c + t cell epitopes will become immunodominant ; it is clear that hla type is important , but the precursor frequency of naive t cells that are specific for hiv proteins is also likely to be a factor that is probably influenced both by genetics and a history of previous ( cross - reactive ) antigen eure ."
"nevertheless , several epitopes for cd4 + t cells have been identified , particularly in gag .","eansion of hiv - specific cd4 + t cell responses occurs in acute hiv - 1 infection , but such responses decline rapidly , ; although , very early administration of art , to control viraemia and prevent the killing of cd4 + t cells , can rescue strong hiv - 1 cd4 + t cell responses , ."
c + t cells develop abnormally and become dysfunctional as hiv - 1 infection progresses ( reviewed in ref .,") , but the early hiv - 1 - specific c + t cell response seems to be functionally normal"
"if a vaccine cannot completely prevent infection , there should be a benefit from stimulating appropriate c + t cell responses , as shown recently in the macaque siv model .","an effective vaccine would need to stimulate c + t cell responses to multiple epitopes , especially to those that are highly conserved ."
"antibodies that show some degree of neutralization of heterologous virus eventually arise in ~ 20% of patients years after infection , , .","to determine the specificity and kinetics of antibody production after hiv - 1 transmission and to understand why broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies are not made during acute hiv infection , it is important to study the earliest b cell responses to the transmitted virus , ."
"env - specific antibody responses to autologous , consensus env epitopes were determined in the same plasma donor cohort as described earlier for innate immunity .","the first detectable b cell response was found to occur days after t in the form of immune complexes , whereas the first free antibody in the plasma was specific for env glycoprotein ( gp ) 41 and appeared days after t ."
"similar to infections with clade b hiv - 1 , the initial autologous - virusneutralizing antibodies induced in clade c infections are induced with similar kinetics and are usually specific only for the initially transmitted env variant , .","although the autologous - virus - neutralizing antibody response can control the virus quasispecies present when these antibodies appear in infections with hiv - 1 clade b or c viruses , the narrowness of the response allows rapid viral escape , 117 ( k . bar and g . shaw , personal communication ) ."
") and the membrane - proximal region recognized by the monoclonal antibodies f5 , z13 and e10 ( refs - 134 ) - are rarely generated during hiv - 1 infection ; when they do occur , they develop only after ~ 20 - 30 months of infection , , , .","these observations indicate that both genetic factors and maturation of the antibody response to hiv - 1 are necessary for the generation of this rare , late , broadspecificity , neutralizing antibody response ."
"the finding that the generation of potentially protective antibodies is delayed until after initial control of viraemia ~ 12 weeks after transmission and then focused on only a few epitopes implies that it will be important to develop a vaccine that primes a very early and broad antibody response that targets multiple neutralizing epitopes for effective control of early viral eansion ; the natural process is too little , too late .",the early perturbations to b cells by the virus similarly indicate the need for a vaccine that either has high levels of durable protective antibody responses or primes in order to induce a rapid secondary response .
"after transmission , there is probably only a - 10 day window during the eclipse phase in which the virus - infected cells could be eradicated , before the virus spreads widely and integrates to generate long - lasting and noneradicable reservoirs of latent virus .",true sterilizing immunity can be attained only if the virus is prevented from infecting any host cells .
"c + t cell - mediated killing , antibody - mediated mechanisms dependent on fcrs ( including antibody - dependent cell - mediated cytotoxicity ( adcc ) ) , nk cell - mediated lysis and - chemokine release all have the potential to prevent early infection .","however , to prevent infection these effector mechanisms would have to be ready primed , as there is not time to activate and eand central memory c + t cells , for example , before chronic infection is established ."
harnessing nk cells and nkt cells might be an effective strategy to control the increase of virally infected cells during the eclipse phase or during the increase in viraemia of early hiv - 1 infection .,"although it may be hazardous to induce chronic hyperactivation of these cells as a means to inhibit virus infection , it may be possible to immunize subjects with hiv - 1 antigens such as peptides that specifically eand potentially protective nk and nkt cell subpopulations , thereby altering the cell repertoire to contain a higher proportion of protective nk cells , ."
"once infection starts to spread , enhancing the natural containment processes might be the only immunological option to benefit infected individuals .","c + t cell responses , which are clearly effective in reducing the peak viraemia during acute infection , could be enhanced through vaccination by increasing their breadth of epitope recognition so that , rather than mediating sequential responses to single epitopes , there would be a simultaneous multi - epitope - specific c + t cell response to the virus , , ."
preliminary unpublished results with eerimental vaccines that include multiple common variants of hiv - 1 proteins such as gag ( mosaic vaccines ) have been shown to enhance the breadth and magnitude of t cell responses in animal studies .,"if a vaccine can induce greater breadth in early t and b cell responses to hiv - 1 than occurs naturally during acute infection , then the use of a combination of protective epitopes in a preventative vaccine may control the early dissemination of hiv - 1 , resulting in a lower viral set point and better long - term immune control ."
"this suggests that a well - designed vaccine strategy might have a chance of achieving good ( if not perfect ) control around the time of acute peak viraemia , preventing the onset of damaging chronic immune activation and damage to generative immune cell environments .","however , vaccine strategies must be developed that potentiate what is clearly a qualitatively and quantitatively insufficient immune response in the first few weeks of hiv - 1 infection ."
viral set point is partially predictive of both how quickly hiv infection will progress and the risk of hiv transmission .,the time at which plasma viraemia settles to a stable level ( within approximately - 6 months from the onset of hiv infection ) .
the ability of a virus to replicate in a given environment .,"by definition in in vitro studies , a drug - resistant virus has greater ability to replicate than wild - type virus when measured in the presence of a drug , similarly a t cell escape mutant will replicate better than wild - type virus when co - cultured with specific t cells ."
"it is the main site of b cell maturation , leading to the generation of memory b cells and plasma cells that produce highaffinity antibody .","a highly specialized and dynamic microenvironment located in peripheral lymphoid tissues ( for example , the spleen or lymph nodes ) ."
"there are four bw4 motif sequences , which differ only at positions ( asn , asp or ser ) and ( ile or thr ) .",the amino acid sequences at positions - 83 in the domain of hla class i heavy chains .
"their generation involves il - 23 and il - 21 , as well as the transcription factors ror t ( retinoic acid - related orphan receptor - t ) and stat3 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) .",a subset of cd4 + t helper cells that produce interleukin - 17 and that are thought to be important in antibacterial and antifungal immunity and may also have a role in autoimmune diseases .
envelope proteins of hiv are initially produced as a precursor glycoprotein of kda ( gp160 ) that is cleaved to generate gp120 and gp41 .,three gp120 molecules and three gp41 molecules are thought to combine in a trimer to form the envelope spike .
"soon thereafter increases in the number of apoptotic microparticles are observed , followed by increased levels of soluble tnf receptor ( tnfr2 ; also known as tnfrsf1b ) and soluble fas ligand .","a portion of the microparticles eress cc - chemokine receptor , suggesting that they originate from cellular targets of hiv - 1 infection ."

the central region of the n protein has also been shown to contain an rnabinding region and primary phosphorylation sites .,phosphorylation of the n protein has been shown to play an important role in virus biology .
"in this study , because of its importance for rna binding , we chose to characterize the structure of the n - terminus of the hcov - oc43 n protein using x - ray crystallography .",it also shows only - 30 % amino acid identity to n proteins from other cov strains .
"all drugs and reagents were purchased from sigma chemical co . ( st . louis , mo ) unless otherwise specified .",all oligoribonucleotides and oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized using an automated dna synthesizer and purified by gel electrophoresis .
"the pcr reaction used pfu dna polymerase , and each cycle involved heating the sample at c for sec , c for min , and c for min / kb of plasmid length ; this sequence was repeated for a total of cycles .",the templates were digested with dpni and transformed into e . coli xl - 1 cells .
"these changes , which were recorded in resonance units ( ru ) , are generally assumed to be proportional to the mass of the molecules bound to the chip .",the apparatus measured binding by monitoring the change in the refractive index of the sensor chip surface .
"at day after infection , the media were removed , the cells were lysed in ml trizol ( invitrogen ) , rna was extracted following the manufacturer ' s instructions , and g of the rna was used as the template for cdna synthesis .","after h , the media was removed and the cells infected with oc43 virus ( moi = ) at c for h in l dmem with shaking every min ."
the single mutants were constructed using a quikchange kit ( stratagene ) with a plasmid containing an open reading frame that encodes the full - length hcov - 2 2 9 e n protein as the template for mutagenesis .,"the pcr products were digested with ndei and xhoi , and the dna fragments were cloned into pet21a ( novagen ) using t4 ligase ( neb ) ."
strands and is connected by a long flexible loop composing of amino acids residues to protruding out of the core .,the core of the structure of hcov - oc43 n - ntd is a fivestranded anti - parallel - sheet sandwiched between loops ( or short heli ( figure a and b ) .
"spencer and hiscox found that the n - terminal region of the ibv protein facilitates longrange , non - specific interactions between the n protein and viral rna , thus leading to the formation of the ribonucleocapsid via a lure and lock mechanism .","it has a right - handed fist - shaped structure , in which palm and finger are rich in basic residues and the flexible loops are organized around the - sheet core of the n - terminal domain ."
"more significantly , as pointed out by saikatendu et al , the surface charge distribution , as shown in figure c , are also quite different for n - ntds from different species .","one common feature , however , is that they all possess positively charged amino acids on or near the protruding loop ."
the results revealed that the r106 residue is highly conserved among these coronaviruses ( figure a ) .,"in addition , structural alignment demonstrated that r106 is located within a positively charged region and protrudes from the protein surface ( figure b ) ."
"the results of the docking simulation , as shown in figure , showed that the interaction between r106 and rna is due to the formation of two hydrogen bonds between the n h group of r106 and the oh groups on the c2 and c3 of the furanose ring in rna .",the n of r106 also forms hydrogen bond with - phosphate group of adenine residue in rna .
spr analyses were then performed to measure the binding affinities between rna and the hcov - oc43 n proteins ( wt and r63v ) .,"to identify the role of r63 in hcov - 2 2 9 e n proteins , which corresponds to r106 in hcov - oc43 , in rna - binding , the r63 residue in the hcov - 2 2 9 e n protein was replaced by valine via site - directed mutagenesis ."
the k a values for rna binding to r107a and r110a are similar to that for wt ; the r117a mutant had the smallest k a value ( 65% ) .,"to examine the effects of other conserved positively charged residues in the positively charged loop of n protein including r107 , k110 and r117 , in rna - binding , we have created three individual mutants , r107a , k110a , and r117a , of hcov - oc43 via sitedirected mutagenesis and tested their rna - binding affinity as detailed in this study ( table ii ) ."
these results support the notion that r106 plays a critical role in virus replication .,the enhancement of viral replication by eression of cov n protein in trans was also reported previously .
"similar to that found in ibv by using site - directed mutagenesis , docking stimulation , spr , and a viral replication assay we demonstrated that r106 of hcov - oc43 played a crucial role in rna binding and virus replication .","the structure of hcov - oc43 n - ntd consists of a single - domain fivesheet structure with a long disordered loops protruding outward , similar to those of the n - ntds from other coronaviruses ."
the fifth cell line gave comparable volumes in the mf1 cross - breed and balb / c parent but a lesser volume in the swiss - webster cross - breed .,the volume of ascites produced by mice injected with four of the five hybrid cell lines tested was greater in the cross - bred offspring than in the balb / c parent .
the increasing usage of monoclonal antibodies ( mab ) as immunological reagents and for research requires the production of high titre preparations .,"it has been shown that mouse hybridoma cell lines will rapidly produce ascites correspondence to : f . stewart , afrc , institute for animal health , compton laboratory , compton , newbury , berks , rg16 onn , u . k ."
"we have extended their study and this report describes the production of first generation crosses derived from the balb / c inbred mouse line and two outbred mouse strains , their use in raising ascites tumours and analysis of the immunoglobulin yield from five hybridoma cell lines .","the study of brodeur and tsang , using a hybrid mouse line to produce large volumes of high titre mabs , suggested a cheaper and more efficient method of producing the reagents required for our studies on the antigenicity of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( tgev ) ."
male and female pairs were housed together and repeat matings usually occurred post - partum .,optimum breeding conditions permitted six litters per pair before fitter size and fecundity decreased .
"mixed groups of randomly selected male and female cross - bred mice of approximately weeks of age , as recommended in the study of brodeur et al .",", were compared to an equivalent number of balb / c male mice of weeks of age , for their ability to produce ascitic fluid ."
"da3 recognises an epitope on the viral nucleoprotein while the remainder are specific to the viral surface projection ( peplomer ) ( garwes et al . , ( garwes et al . , , .","two of them ( 3 c156 and d442 ) produce antibody capable of neutralising tgev , the remaining three ( da3 , bl15 and d298 ) have no detectable neutralising capability ."
"after clarification of the fluid by centrifugation at g , the final volume was measured and the fluids stored at c until required .","the sex of the mouse , the volume of fluid removed from it and the presence of solid tumours was noted ."
an equal volume of the same medium containing tcids0 of the fs772 / 70 strain of tgev was added and incubated at c for h before / ~ 1 of each sample was transferred to confluent monolayer cultures of secondary adult pig thyroid ( apt / 2 ) cells in well plates .,"after a further days incubation at c , end points were determined by scoring for cytopathic changes ."
after incubation at room temperature for min the plates were washed as before then examined with a leitz ortholux microscope fitted with a fluorescence vertical illuminator .,fitc - rabbit anti - mouse immunoglobulin ( nordic ) was diluted / 40 in pbsa and / al was added to each well .
"aliquots of / ~ 1 were air - dried onto polyvinyl well plates ( falcon , becton & dickinson ) at o c and then fixed with % acetone and blocked with pbsa containing % tween , % gelatin ( ptg ) for min at o c .","tgev was pelleted from tissue culture supernatant fluid through % sucrose at g for h . after resuspension in distilled deionised water ( ddw ) , to / 100 of the original volume , the virus was treated with % nonidet np - 40 for min at room temperature then diluted / 10 in ddw ."
"and d2 ) there were areas of cellular aggregation throughout the mesentery , but these did not appear to interfere with the production of the fluid .",some mice died before the ascites could develop and this occurred more frequently with the c156 and da3 groups in both the cross - bred mouse strains .
the titres of fluids collected on different days after injection did not differ significantly within each eerimental group and the results were pooled .,table iii shows the pooled results for each assay with each hybridoma cell line raised in the three types of mice .
"although balb / c , swr and mf1 mice are reasonably docile and easy to handle , there is a marked difference in the temperaments of both types of cross - breed .",although they have a slightly lower body weight at this age they produce as much ascitic fluid as their - week - old counterparts .
the number of days required for all the mice in each group to be completely harvested is also markedly different .,the balb / c mice are usually ready for fluid harvest - 21 days ( mean 08 days _ + 823 ) following injection so that the fluid is collected within a short time span .
that these differences were not due solely to the larger size of the mf1 / x mice is suggested by analysis of the yields of fluid / g body weight .,statistical analysis of the volumes of fluid removed from the three mouse strains showed that there was a significant difference between the mf1 / x and balb / c yields ( p < 1 ) whereas there was only a slight difference between the balb / c and swr / x yields ( p = 4 ) and between the swr / x and mf1 / x yields ( p = 0 ) .
"at this laboratory there have been some problems with balb / c mice producing an increased proportion of hard tumours , so reducing the volume of fluid that can be collected .",we are now using mf1 / x mice for the routine production of ascitic fluids where the longer time taken for the fluids to form is not of importance .
there appears to be some correlation between the body weight of the mice used and the amount of fluid produced in them .,in many laboratories fluid is removed from the mouse by the repeated insertion of a sterile hypodermic needle into the abdominal cavity to permit drainage of the fluid .
the mean volume of ascitic fluid harvested from the three strains also shows that the mf1 / x produce up to twice as much fluid as the balb / c strain .,"this implies a more economical use of all animals from a litter of mf1 / x mice , rather than just the males as is normal with balb / c mice ."
this study indicates the value of first generation cross - bred offspring from the parental balb / c strain and an outbred mouse strain for the production of large volumes of ascitic fluid containing high titre monoclonal antibodies .,"the first generation crosses are easy to produce , moderately easy to handle , and give consistently large volumes of high titre ascitic fluid compared to the balb / c parent ."
uni - or bilateral radial nerve palsy in newborn is a rare symptom .,we report about a case of unusual bilateral radial nerve palsy in a term - born girl who recovered completely after months and review the english - speaking literature about this condition .
"in contrast to neonatal brachial plexus palsy , an isolated peripheral nerve lesion at the upper limb is a rare occurrence in newborns .","until now , in a small number of publications , less than cases of newborns with an isolated radial nerve palsy are reported and only four cases with a bilateral lesion ."
"with respect to the clinical features , sometimes this condition could be misdiagnosed as a variant of brachial plexus palsy .","however , these conditions must be distinguished , because management and prognosis are different ."
"the delivery took place in a regional hospital and was documented as normal without any special problems such as using instruments , or pressing or pulling at the arms .",the duration of delivery was less than h . it was the mother ' s second pregnancy .
"the parents noted the special hand position in the second week of life , but they were not worried because , in general , the child was well and they planned to ask the paediatrician at the next screening examination .","the parents did not observe any abnormalities on the skin of the arms , nor redness , nor retraction ."
there was no wrist drop anymore but the finger was not flexed at rest .,"she showed normal , active finger movements and played equally with both hands ."
"other than in our case , in all newborns with bilateral radial nerve palsies , a difficult delivery and skin lesions on the dorsolateral side of the upper arms were described .","reviewing the english - speaking literature , we found reported isolated radial nerve palsies in newborns ( table ) , most of them unilateral ( 93 %) [ 1 - 7 , , , - 15 ] ; in only five cases , including our report , bilateral manifestations were described ."
"most authors assume that pressure due to abnormal intrauterine position accounts for radial nerve palsy , too .","in general , the outcome of this lesion is good : complete recovery was seen in ( 94 %) children during days to years , treated with wrist splinting and physiotherapy [ 1 , ."
"in a differential diagnosis , a local bacterial infection such as arthritis , osteomyelitis , or abscess at the shoulder region or humerus fracture has to be considered .",the presence of the grasp reflex is the main differential clinical feature between radial nerve palsy of the newborn and distal symptoms of brachial plexus palsy .
"isolated radial nerve palsy in newborns , with or without skin lesions , has predominantly a favourable outcome with conservative treatment like wrist splinting , occupational , and physiotherapy and has to be clearly distinguished from brachial plexus palsy with a highly variable outcome .",our case describes the first case of bilateral radial nerve palsy without a complicated delivery and without skin lesions on the upper arms .
"according to the report of the ministry of health and welfare ' s central mers response team , as of jun , the number of south koreans diagnosed with the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) increased to since the first case was reported , including deaths .","since th may , the world has been paying significant attention to the emerging outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) , rather than in the middle east but in south korea ."
both the cases were found in medical staffs and they both died later .,"since the sources of all the mers patients were associated with the middle east , the who in may named it as middle east respiratory syndrome ."
"because of the numerous contacts , there will be more new cases reported in the future .","the reported cases in south korea were distributed at least hospitals , but the involved hospitals are as many as or even more ."
the exact source and mode of transmission of mers - cov to human beings is unknown .,"initial investigations suggested that mers - cov originate in bats , however , mers - cov has never been isolated from bats ."
"the virus appeared to be able to spread from human to human through respiratory droplets , and it can also spread through close contact with secretions or excretions of the patients infected by mers - cov .","recent studies suggested that dromedary camels may be the intermediate host of mers - cov , and human can be infected through contact with infected dromedary , for example , eure to secretion , excreta ( urine and stool ) , undercooked dairy or meat products ."
"about % of the cases may suffer from vomiting , abdominal pain , diarrhea and other symptoms .","the severe cases can develop severe pneumonia within week , which may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) , acute renal failure , and even multiple organ failure ( modf ) ."
the chest radiography abnormalities could be from % to % in mers patients .,"but the image findings on chest radiography can range from minimal to extensive abnormalities , it presented with viral pneumonitis and acute respiratory distress syndrome , with bilateral hilar infiltration , unilateral or bilateral patchy densities or infiltrates , segmented or lobar opacities , ground - glass opacities [ 7 e10 ] ."
"no differences in fiber loading , integrindependency of transduction , or factor - x binding could be established between protein ix - containing and protein ieficient particles .","our data suggest that protein ix can affect the cell tropism of hadv - 5 , and may function to dampen the innate immune responses against hadv particles ."
"recent work by different groups has brought consensus on its location and topology in the capsid ( fabry et al . , ; saban et al . , ) .","the location and function of protein ix in the virus capsid has been the subject of investigation and debate for many years ( vellinga et al . , b ) ."
"alternatively , targeting ligands can be coupled to protein ix via the genetic inclusion of cysteine residues and subsequent chemical coupling of ligands to the reactive thiol groups ( corjon et al . , ) .","multiple polypeptides can be incorporated simultaneously ( tang et al . , ) ."
the exact molecular mechanism behind this ' pix effect ' remains to be delineated .,"our data suggest that protein ix can affect the cell tropism of hadv - 5 , and may function to dampen the innate immune responses against hadv particles ."
"we analyzed the vector ad5 e1pix leu , which lacks a major part of the c - terminal region of protein ix ( amino acids to ) for reporter gene eression in mz2 - mel3 . 0 and mz2 - mel3 . 0 / car .",the biological function of this conserved domain of protein ix is unknown .
"as previously described , pieficient hadv - 5 particles have an enhanced tendency to partly dissociate into fiberand penton base - lacking particles ( fabry et al . , ) .","the ad5 e1 pix stock appeared to contain more small particulate matter , possibly virus debris ."
"in parallel to cell tropism extending capsid modifications described for other viruses ( de haan et al . , ) , it is likely that protein ix deletion from a replication - competent hadv - 5 virus would result in a modified ability to spread in monolayer cell cultures .","to investigate this , we constructed the replication - competent hadv - 5 viruses ad5 + pix and ad5 pix ."
from our data we conclude that the omission of protein ix from hadv - 5 vectors enhances viral transduction of cell lines that are low in eression of the adenovirus receptor car .,this finding is of relevance for the development and implementation of protein ixgene modified hadv - 5 vectors .
"the specificity for the c - terminal domain of protein ix excludes differences in viral capsid stability as a cause for the observed phenomenon , since deletion of this domain does not result in reduced capsid stability ( vellinga et al . , a ) .","interestingly , the vector ad5 e1pix leu had ad5 e1 pix - like properties , implicating the importance of the c - terminal domain of protein ix in inhibiting transgene eression in car - negative cell lines ."
"unfortunately , our efforts to compare the vectors for a general difference in cell - binding affinity , using alexa488 - tfp ( tetrafluorophenyl ) labeled vector particles , were not conclusive as a result of strong and reproducible negative effects of the labeling procedure on the pieficient vector particles .","the effects were not identical for protein iitive and protein ixnegative particles , making the results obtained with these particles in comparative binding assays unreliable ."
this suggests the tropism modifying mutation affects the virus ' s capacity to spread from cell to cell .,"such small - plaque phenotypes of extended tropism mutants is not unprecedented : similar phenotypes have been described for murine corona virus mutants that acquired the capacity to bind heparin ( de haan et al . , ) ."
"c 6 is an activation marker on antigen - presenting cells such as monocytes , macrophages , dendritic cells , and b cells , and is important for co - stimulation of t cells ( reiser and stadecker , ) .",the increased activation of monocytes despite similar levels of transduction ( gfp eression ) could be due to a direct effect on the monocytes themselves or indirectly via a more efficient stimulation of t cells or nk cells .
"irrespective of the mechanism , the increased activation of monocytes and nk cells as a result of protein ix deletion is likely to have important consequences for the in vivo implementation of protein ix modified hadv - 5 vectors , since monocytes ( after differentiation to kupffer macrophages in the liver ) as well as nk cells are important players in the sequestration of hadv - 5 vectors from the blood after systemic delivery ( reviewed in muruve , ) .","furthermore , the observed differences in pbmc activation between ad5 e1 + pix and ad5 e1 pix suggest a biological function of protein ix in diminishing the immune response against hadv - 5 ."
"administration of ad5 e1 pix yielded more than ten - fold higher luciferase activity in the liver , for reasons that remain to be clarified .",omission of protein ix from the capsid resulted in a remarkable difference between ad5 e1 + pix and ad5 e1 pix upon intravenous administration in mice .
"a biological role for protein ix in hadv - 5 capsid stabilization has been proposed , based on in vitro heat - stability assays ( vellinga et al . , a ) .",protein ix is strongly conserved in all primate adenoviruses indicating the importance of the protein .

"a standard agar overlay plaque assay on cells was used to determine the infectious virus concentration in plaque forming units per ml ( pfu / ml ) ( fallaux et al . , ) .","titration of the vector stocks was performed by a picogreen - dna binding assay to determine the concentration in physical vector particles per ml ( pp / ml ) ( murakami and mccaman , ) ."
"the spei site and the downstream ' pix - remainder sequence ' were left intact , since part of this sequence forms a hairpin - loop structure situated over the polya site of the e1b transcript , which might be essential for efficient polymerase slippage needed for polyadenylation ( sittler et al . , ) .",the scai site was restored to the wild - type hadv - 5 sequence by exchanging the scai - overlapping mfei / hindiii fragment with the corresponding fragment from ptg3602 .
the coding sequence for the e3 adenovirus death protein ( adp ) was retained .,the kanamycin resistance gene ( inserted with the pshuttle - e3 - adp - egfp - f2 fragment ) was removed by clai digestion and religation of the two largest fragments .

"we found that rbd193 - cho reacted strongly with a panel of six monoclonal antibodies recognizing various conformational and linear epitopes in rbd , suggesting that this recombinant protein maintains intact conformation and good antigenicity .",here we used cho - k1 cells to establish a cell line for stable eression of a - mer ( residues - 510 ) rbd ( rbd193 - cho ) and determined its antigenicity and immunogenicity .
"therefore , establishment of an approach for producing large quantity of recombinant rbd with appropriate antigenicity and immunogenicity is needed .","the receptor - binding domain ( rbd ) in s protein contains multiple conformational - dependent epitopes that induce potent neutralizing antibodies against sars - cov infection , suggesting an attractive target for development of sars vaccine ."
"based on this reasoning , the present study aimed to eress a - mer ( residues - 510 ) recombinant rbd of sars - cov s protein ( rbd193 - cho ) in an established stable cho - k1 cell line and further determine its antigenicity , immunogenicity and protective immunity in a mouse model .","therefore , the successful eression and purification of a number of recombinant proteins in cho - k1 cells provides a rational basis for developing effective and economic subunit sars vaccines by continuous production of recombinant proteins containing the functional domains of sars - cov s protein ."
"the recombinant rbd plasmid was transiently transfected using fugene transfection reagents ( roche applied science , indianapolis , in ) into cho - k1 cells ( atcc , manassas , va ) .","genes encoding a - amino acid ( residues - 510 ) rbd of sars - cov s protein were amplified by pcr using the plasmid containing the codon - optimized full - length s protein as the template , followed by insertion into the gs gene eression vector pee14 . 1 ."
immunization of mice with rbd193 - cho resulted in induction of high titers of rbd - specific neutralizing antibodies and potent il - 4 - eressing t cell responses .,rbd193 - cho induced immunity that protected a majority of the vaccinated mice from sars - cov challenge .

"to assess this , balb / c mice were immunized with purified rbd193 - cho protein as described in materials and methods , and humoral immune responses and neutralizing activity were detected in the vaccinated mouse sera .","a good vaccine antigen should first be able to induce humoral immune responses , which are mainly represented by the induction of specific antibodies in vaccinated individuals ."
"it can either transiently or stably eress recombinant antigens , promote signal synthesis , and correctly fold , secrete and glycosylate synthesized proteins .",recombinant proteins eressed in this way may maintain native conformation and good antigenicity and immunogenicity .
"therefore , cho - k1 cells , rather than t cells , were selected because cho - k1 cells have the ability to eress the protein of interest persistently at a high level .","based on this rationale , the plasmid for transient eression of a - amino acid ( residues - 510 ) rbd ( rbd193 - cho ) of sars - cov s protein in cho - k1 cells was constructed first ."

background : globalization and the potential for rapid spread of emerging infectious diseases have heightened the need for ongoing surveillance and early detection .,the global public health intelligence network ( gphin ) was established to increase situational awareness and capacity for the early detection of emerging public health events .
"findings : every day the gphin analyzes over more than , 000 online news reports ( over , 000 sources ) in nine languages worldwide .","a web - based program aggregates data based on an algorithm that provides potential signals of emerging public health events which are then reviewed by a multilingual , multidisciplinary team ."
integration of additional big data sources and advances in analytical capacity could further strengthen the gphin ' s capability for timely detection and early warning .,the gphin ' s early adoption of big data has increased global capacity to detect international infectious disease outbreaks and other public health events .
it is quickly becoming integral to a variety of aspects of health ranging from health care administration to google flu and pharmacosurveillance .,"big data has been used to optimize sales and business processes , inform trades among sports teams and to improve city planning ."
"when a risk is identified , analysts disseminate relevant information and alerts to senior officials and stakeholders for decision - making .","while initially devised to identify communicable disease outbreaks , the system has also been used to monitor potential chemical and radio nuclear hazards ."
"volume describes the quantity of data that is collected , velocity is the speed at which the data is collected and disseminated and variety refers to the multiplicity of sources that are used to compile the data .","big data has been defined by three v ' s: volume , velocity and variety ."
local newspapers and newsletters are scanned because emerging events can be a localized phenomenon and are often reported in community newspapers and newsletters .,"various sections of news publications ( sports , travel and finance ) are also monitored as they may signal an emerging public health event ."
"access to the gphin system is provided to entities that have the responsibility to monitor , respond to and or mitigate emerging public health threats .",gphin analysts sift through these news reports to identify and provide alerts about events with potential implications for decision - making by stakeholders .
the first english report about an atypical outbreak in china was noted by a pharmaceutical company in the financial section of a newspaper that had reported increased sales of its antiviral drugs .,its utility was initially demonstrated during the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) outbreak in when early alerts were provided in reports from chinese newspapers .
"after the sars outbreak , the gphin outputs have been used by multiple countries to eand their surveillance capacity .",the ihrs note that the who may include reports from sources other than official notifications or consultations in their assessment of a potential emerging public health event .
"initial spanish language reports about the outbreak noted an unusual respiratory outbreak in the state of veracruz , mexico that had claimed two lives .","over the years , the gphin has continued to detect early signals of outbreaks of international concern such as the pandemic influenza h1n1 in ."
"in april , the gphin identified eight cases of an unknown respiratory illness and one death in jordan .","gphin issued an alert notifying stakeholders , including the who , about these cases ."
"this process has been much more efficient than individually contacting commercial transportation companies , travel agencies and airports .","examples of situational awareness of mitigation strategies include the gphin ' s ability to scan for cancellation of flights or cruises , new travel advisories , health screening procedures at border crossings or trade bans ."
"for example , during pandemic influenza h1n1 , the gphin was used as an intelligence source by the world trade organization to monitor the extent and the effect of trade bans .","similarly , during the recent response to the ebola outbreak in west africa , the gphin provided situational awareness about the cancellation of flights , travel advisories and health screening procedures at border crossings ."
"potential new data sources internet , email , smart phones and social media have developed rapidly since the gphin was first developed .","as a result , potential new sources of big data have emerged that can be analyzed to detect signals of early infectious disease outbreaks ."
"for example , google flu trends monitors online search behaviour for early warning signs of influenza ; researchers have used facebook to help predict health outcomes at the local population health level ; twitter has been used as a large source of data to monitor health trends during an avian influenza outbreak ; and mobile phones have been used to measure human mobility patterns in the context of malaria transmission in the developing world .","in addition , other organizations have started to mine social media resources to improve disease surveillance ."
social media has improved emergency response by providing real - time data capture about the health of communities and the public response to an event .,"for example , the use of smartphones and twitter in nigeria during the ebola outbreak in west africa helped to identify an outbreak in a new area three days before a who announcement ."
this has been used by participatory infectious disease surveillance applications such as flu near you and doctorme .,other novel applications include crowdsourcing systems that capture voluntarily submitted symptoms from the general public through the internet or mobile phone networks and rapidly aggregate and provide feedback about data in near real - time .
"with the influx of discussions and tweets surrounding the ebola outbreak in west africa , for example , it was difficult to distinguish between actual signals of concern and the plethora of messages that would otherwise be eected during such an event .","in addition , some social media , such as tweets that are limited to characters , may not have enough contextual information to help discern a reliable signal ."
the gphin is continuously assessing and honing the aggregators and algorithms used which could potentially result in more advanced forms of artificial intelligence .,"also up for consideration is whether better data processing could reduce reliance on a multilingual , multidisciplinary team ."
"overall , big data approaches have become a vital component of local , national and international public health efforts to detect , report , and control emerging outbreaks .","ongoing advances in big data including the use of social media and smart phones , as well as advances in analytical capacity provide opportunities for the further enhancement of the gphin ."
"her son , who lived with her in toronto , began to develop similar symptoms and presented to a toronto emergency department ( ed ) where he was diagnosed with pneumonia and admitted .","in february , a woman who had recently returned home to toronto from a trip to hong kong began to exhibit signs and symptoms of a febrile respiratory illness ; she died at home days later ."

how many are being cared for by overextended ed nurses who are not able to come close to the nursing ratios required to provide appropriate care ?,how many are unknowingly being eed to patients with communicable diseases for whom the ed is ill equipped to provide appropriate respiratory isolation ?
ed crowding has reached the point at which it now represents a major north american public health crisis .,the crux of the problem is not the volume of patients with splinters or stubbed toes or the sniffles who seek care in our eds ; it is a lack of access to appropriate inpatient beds for our seriously ill patients who require admission to the hospital .
"and in the example from the early days of sars , it can facilitate the transmission of life - threatening infections .",it delays critical therapies such as thrombolysis ; it results in ambulance diversion or delays in offloading ambulance patients in many areas ; it has a negative impact on the education of our trainees .
"when one takes into consideration the patients on our stretchers , in our waiting rooms , and on ambulance stretchers waiting to be transferred to an ed stretcher , most eds do not come close to providing comparable ratios of nurses to patients based on their acuity and needs .",why is this acceptable quality of care in the ed if it is not acceptable on an inpatient unit ?
"admittedly , such an approach is not the answer for all admitted patients ; those requiring respiratory isolation , for instance , represent as much of a risk on a ward hallway as they do in an ed hallway .","however , at least this serves to reduce the number of admitted patients in the ed so that staff is better able to provide care to those ' ' boarded ' ' patients for whom ward hallway placement is inappropriate ."
dr . viccellio has demonstrated the positive effects on patient care as a result of implementing this protocol : shorter lengths of stay and the virtual disappearance of ambulance diversion in the area .,the majority of these patients spent less than hour in the hallway of the appropriate inpatient unit before moving into a bed ; more than a quarter of the patients went directly to a room .
"the national health service established an ambitious goal : that patients , on average , would spend less than hours in an ed , regardless of whether they were admitted , discharged , or transferred .","in the early s , england was facing the same challenges that we continue to face in north american eds ."
"but the first step , as is true of so many challenges in life , is accepting that we have a problem .","without a recognition at the highest levels of government and health care administration that the current realities of emergency care are simply unacceptable , and without the desire and commitment to change , we and our patients are stuck with the status quo ."
"we have watched the media turn its attention to the issue of ed crowding off and on for the last several years ; yet despite growing public awareness , there seems little public or political will to address the issue meaningfully .","paradoxically , there is a risk that such sustained coverage of the problem , absent any solutions , will only serve to desensitize the public and lead them to the conclusion that nothing can be done ."
"as individuals , we do not need lobbying skills or political connections or more statistics .",no one is in a better position to effect change than we are .

"as a result , the levels of tnfr1 and tnfr2 mrna eression in pbmc were higher in fip cats than in spf cats and fipv - infected non - fip cats ( fig .","since tnf - alpha binds to cell surface tnfreceptor ( tnfr ) and tnfr2 to induce apoptosis and cell proliferation , we compared the levels of tnfr1 and tnfr2 mrna eression in the pbmc of fip cats , spf cats and fipv - infected non - fip cats ."

"fipv does not replicate in lymphocytes , suggesting that this apoptosis in lymphocytes is not directly induced by fipv infection , but indirectly by other factors .",the detailed mechanism of apoptosis induction in the lymphoid tissues of fip cats is not clear .
"the ascitic fluid of fip cats contains cells such as macrophages , lymphocytes , and neutrophils , all of which produce tnf - alpha .","in this study , we used pec containing adherent cells , obtained after removing non - adherent cells present in the ascitic fluid ."

"currently , we are investigating the relationship between lymphocyte apoptosis induction and the fas ligand in fip cats .","it is also possible that apoptosis - inducing factors other than tnf - alpha , such as fas ligand and trail , are involved in lymphocyte apoptosis in fip cats , for which further investigation is necessary ."

"indeed , between and , visceral larva migrans ( vlm ) linked to b . schroederi infection was reported to be responsible for % ( 12 / 24 ) of mortalities in the giant panda ( zhang et al . , ) .","in particular , a disease ( baylisascariasis ) caused by the ascaridoid nematode baylisascaris schroederi ( mcintosh , ) is a leading cause of deaths in wild populations ( zhang et al . , ) ."
"however , surprisingly , there is limited published information on the parasites of the giant panda ( n peer - reviewed publications and archived governmental reports ; january ) , most of which have been published in the chinese literature ( n publications ) .","unpublished information from zoos , animal parks and breeding centres ( sources available from authors ) suggests that parasites of the giant panda continue to be a persistent and chronic issue , adversely impacting the health and conservation of this iconic animal ."
"since b . schroederi ( originally named ascaris schroederi ) ( mcintosh , ) was found in the small intestine from a giant panda in the new york zoological park ( now the bronx zoo ) in , an increasing number of parasites have been identified in this animal species .","to date , at least parasite taxa , including endoparasites ( 5 nematode , trematode and protozoan taxa ) and ectoparasites ( 13 tick , mite , flea taxa and ' blow fly ' ) have been recorded in the giant panda ( table ) ."
"dermacentor taiwanensis iidae skin surface described in two reviews of parasites of the giant panda ( yang , ; zhang et al . , ) ; however , original literature is not available from either review n / a n / a","the gastroenteritis maggots were found in a giant panda , without morphological description n / a no genus and species names li et al ."
"although not all aspects of this cycle have been proven , based on postmortem findings for giant pandas ( ccrcgp , unpublished data ) and eerimentally infection studies in mice ( li , ( li , , a ( li , , b , , evidence indicates that giant pandas become infected via the faecal - oral route , and larvae undergo hepatopulmonary and somatic migration prior to establishing as dioecious adults in the small intestine .","currently , there is no evidence of vertical or transmammary transmission of b . schroederi ."
li found that % of b . schroederi eggs contained infective larvae within days at c .,"it usually takes - 4 weeks for fertile eggs of b . schroederi to become infective at c in moist and shaded soil ( wu et al . , ) , whereas - 10 weeks are required by ascaris eggs under the same conditions ( maung , ) ."
"however , due to the large amount of undigested bamboo fibers in giant panda ' s faeces , b . schroederi eggs may be challenging to detect using a microscopy upon routine laboratory examination .","although the presence of adult worms in the faeces or vomit indicates infection in giant pandas , the diagnosis of b . schroederi infection is commonly performed using the quantitative mcmaster test or a semiquantitative sedimentation - flotation method in most breeding centres and zoos ( loeffler et al . , ; zhang and zhang , ) ."
"schroederi serum antibody ( igg ) in eerimentally infected mice , with a sensitivity of % and a specificity of % ( xie et al . , a ) .","however , such an assay has not yet been assessed for the diagnosis of baylisascariasis or b . schroederi infection in giant pandas ."
"apart from work directed towards a vaccine against b . schroederi , efforts have also been made to understand aspects of the molecular biology and genetics of this parasite .","in another study , the microrna profile of b . schroederi via high - throughput sequencing and real - time quantitative pcr suggested that chitinases , ovarian or egg development related proteins and ribosomes were the targets of large numbers of micrornas for the regulation of genes at the posttranscriptional level ."
"importantly , showed that s was not a suitable candidate marker for assessing variation within the genus baylisascaris , but that s and s sequences were capable of distinguishing b . schroederi from b . ailuri and b . transfuga .","following the publication of the complete mitochondrial genome of b . schroederi ( see xie et al . , undertook the first molecular characterisation of this parasite using nuclear ribosomal ( r ) rna genes ( 1 8 s and s ) and a mitochondrial gene ( 1 2 s ) ."
"again , these authors found no discernable genetic difference in worms among the populations from distinct habitats of the giant panda ( i . e .","( , b used portions of the mitochondrial cox1 , atp6 and s rrna genes , which displayed very few parsimony informative sites ."
"these mites are commonly found in herbivorous hosts , including cattle , sheep , goats , horses , camelids and moose ( yeruham et al . , ) .",( acariformes : psoroptidae ) are skin mites that cause mange in domestic and wild animals .
"in addition , wild giant pandas are usually solitary animals , and only occasionally interact with each other , mainly during their short mating season ( schaller et al . , ) .","however , to date , there is only one published record of c . panda infection in wild populations of the giant panda , although obtaining such information for such populations is a considerable challenge ."
other ectoparasites that can affect the health of the giant panda are ( bloodfeeding ) hard ticks .,"since the first description of tick infection by haemaphysalis warburtoni ( wu and hu , a ) , an increasing number of hard tick species have been identified on giant pandas in the last two decades ( lai et al . , ; ma , ; qiu and zhu , ; yu et al . , ) ."
"in addition , these authors reported a higher prevalence of cryptosporidium infection in captive than in wild giant panda populations .",whether this difference relates to a high degree of transmission of cryptosporidium among giant pandas or between other animals and pandas in a captive ( high population density ) environment remains to be elucidated .
"although e . bieneusi is known as an emerging and opportunistic enteric pathogen , causing diarrhoea in humans and animals , and progress has been made in our knowledge of the epidemiology of e . bieneusi , the transmission routes of this pathogen are still unclear ( matos et al . , ; sant n , ) .","given the possibility of transmission via respiratory secretions ( mathis et al . , ) and the potentially broad host range of this pathogen ( sant n and fayer , ) , whether this new genotype i - like e . bieneusi has a specific host affiliation to the giant panda remains to be elored ."
"additional multilocus , nested pcr - rflp analysis , using genetic markers ( sag1 , sag2 , sag3 , btyb , gra6 , c22 - 8 , c29 - 2 , l358 , pk1 and apico ; see dubey et al . , ) , provided evidence that the t . gondii isolate causing this panda ' s death represented an atypical genotype ( with reference to strains gt1 , ptg , ctg , mas , tgcgcal , tgcatbr5 , tacatbr40 , tgcatbr64 and tgrscr1 ) .","the necropsy findings , and serological results from an immunofluorescence assay and a modified agglutination test as well as pcr results for dna from tissue biopsy samples ( from liver , spleen , lungs , kidneys and intestines ) all indicated that the giant panda had died from acute tolasmosis ."

"without an accurate catalogue of which parasite species exist in wildlife , and a deep understanding of their life cycles , biology and the diseases that they cause , it is challenging to evaluate their risk to animal health ( colwell et al . , ) .","although numerous parasite taxa ( n ) have been detected / recorded in the giant panda ( table ) , many of them , such as sarcocystis , strongyloides and lungworm ( see table ) , have not been described in any detail , and , to our knowledge , no voucher specimens are readily accessible in china ."
"this limitation seems to have been somewhat overcome by the development of a pcr - based diagnostic approach ( see section ; wang et al . , a ) for the simultaneous genetic ' fingerprinting ' of individual pandas ( see section ; zhang et al . , ) and the detection of their parasites in faecal samples , which could be used for field studies , in order to elore the distribution and dynamics of parasitic infections / diseases .","in addition , a major impediment to large - scale epidemiological investigations of giant panda parasites is the difficulty of assessing infection status in freeranging populations ."
"such approaches might include the use of effective disinfectants ( against the egg stage ) to block transmission , new drugs with different modes of action and / or vaccination .","because of the potential for anthelmintic resistance to develop in b . schroederi , as a consequence of routine and excessive use of anthelmintics in captive animals , an integrated approach for baylisascariasis control needs to be elored ."
"mice , rodents and / or rabbits ) prior to any well - controlled trials ( without eerimental challenge infection ) in captive panda populations in which b . schroederi is known to be highly endemic , to assess whether a reduction in prevalence and intensity of infection is achievable .","clearly , developing an anti - baylisascaris vaccine for an endangered animal , such as the giant panda , presents considerable challenges , such that immunogens might need to be selected based on consistent protection and immunorecognition in different laboratory ( paratenic ) hosts ( e . g ."
"given that anthelmintics are often used routinely and excessively in a suppressive manner in captive animal populations , there is a probability that drug resistance is emerging ( cf .","in the last three decades , multidrug resistance has emerged across five continents in endoparasites and ectoparasites of animals and , to some extent , those of humans ( blake and coles , ; coles et al . , ; geary , ; kaplan , ; mcnair , ; srivastava and misra - bhattacharya , ; vercruysse et al . , ) ."
"although this animal is critically endangered , this review indicates , surprisingly , that parasitological research of this animal is in its infancy .","by sharing new knowledge and information , this would not only significantly increase the utilisation of available data and clinical information but also enhance research opportunities to ensure the conservation of the giant panda ."
"the development of the complex network graphs permits us to describe any real system such as social , neural , computer or genetic networks by transforming real properties in topological indices ( tis ) .",this work uses randic ' s star networks in order to convert the protein primary structure data in specific topological indices that are used to construct a natural / random protein classification model .
"this set is characterized by a protein homology of %, a structure resolution of and r - factor lower than %.",the set of natural proteins contains protein chains selected from the pre - compiled culledpdb list from pisces dunbrack ' s web lab .
the model was constructed with the general discriminant analysis methods from statistica package and gave training / predicting set accuracies of 7% for the forward stepwise model type .,"a new sequence to star networks ( s2snet ) wython gui application ( with a graphviz graphics back - end ) was designed by our group in order to transform any character sequence in the following star network topological indices : shannon entropy of markov matrices , trace of connectivity matrices , harary number , wiener index , gutman index , schultz index , moreau - broto indices , balaban distance connectivity index , kier - hall connectivity indices and randic connectivity index ."
this classification can be used in the studies of the protein functions by changing some fragments with random amino acid sequences or to detect the fake amino acid sequences or the errors in proteins .,"these results promote the use of the s2snet application not only for protein structure analysis but also for mass spectroscopy , clinical proteomics and imaging , or dna / rna structure analysis ."
graph theory can be used to obtain macromolecular descriptors named topological indices ( tis ) .,"one of the widely used methods for the predicting of the protein properties is quantitative structure activity relationship ( qsar ) ( devillers and balaban , ) ."
"the data are transformed into sequence and connectivity star graph ' s tis , which are then used as input for a statistical linear method in the construction of a simple classification model .",the actual work presents for the first time a natural / random protein classification using only the chain sequence and amino acid connectivity protein structural data .
"python scripts are used to download pdb files from the pdb data bank ( berman et al . , ) and to create the correspondent dssp file with the dssp application ( kabsch and sander , ) .",the random set is composed by the same standard amino acid types and the average length of the chains is the same as that of the natural set .
"in addition , as a general property , there is a unique path between any pair of vertices .","the star graph is a special case of trees with n vertices where one has got n degrees of freedom and the remaining n vertices have got one single degree of freedom ( harary , ) ."
"the same protein can be represented by different forms which are associated to distinct distance matrices ( randic et al . , ) .","if the vertices do not carry a label , the sequence information will be lost ; for that reason , the best method is to construct a standard star graph where each amino acid / vertex holds the position in the original sequence and the branches are labelled by alphabetical order of the three - letter amino acid code ( randic et al . , ) ."
these matrices and the normalized ones are the base for the tis calculation .,"in the case of the embedded graph , the matrices of the connectivity in the sequence and in the star graph are combined ."
"the user of this interactive tool is able to choose the level of calculations , such as : embedded graph , additional weights for each amino acid , markov normalization , power of the matrix connectivity , the input files ( files with sequences , groups and weights ) , the output files , the level of details ( files for summary and detailed results ) and the type of graph visualization ( dot , neato , fdp , twopi , circo ) .","s2snet is a wython ( noel rappin , ) gui application with graphviz ( koutsofios , ) as a graphics back - end ."

the values obtained for the training / predicting accuracies are presented in table .,"eight models were constructed using embedded / non - embedded star graph tis obtained with s2snet application and forward , backward and best subset model types ."
wilk ' s u is used to measure the statistical significance of the discriminatory power of the model and has values from ( no discriminatory power ) to ( perfect discriminatory power ) .,"the f value shows the statistical significance in the discrimination between groups , a measure of the extent to which a variable makes a unique contribution to a prediction of group membership ."
the validity and statistical significance of any model is conditioned by the above - mentioned factors .,"the parametrical assumptions such as normality , homoscedasticity ( homogeneity of variances ) and non - colinearity have the same importance in the application of multivariate statistic techniques to qspr ( bisquerra alzina , ; stewart , ) as the correct specification of the mathematical form has ."
"thus , we carried out two significant tests for normality , chi - square and kolmogorov - smirnov tests , and we have found significant statistical differences ( po0 . 01 ) on the respective values ( chi - square , d ) .",the validity of the gda models depends on the normal distribution of the sample used as well as the homogeneity of their variances .

"the process began as early as the s , and grew rapidly .","telemedicine has been a notable success story ( hsieh et al . , ; xiue and liang , ) ."
"the formal reasons for implementing e - government include attempts to transform the nature of government functions ( i . e . , clearly delineate agencies ' obligations and duties ) , reengineer the structure of the state to become more lean and mean , and enhance transparency , openness , and responsiveness .","broadly , the intended result was to shift away from direct supervision of local agencies and publicize their functions and duties ."
"this tension reflects the broader conflict throughout china between the older , nationalist center of power concerned with retaining its monopoly over information and the newer , privatized , and globalized centers that tolerate diverse flows of information .","in short , china wants to promote and rein in the internet simultaneously ."

the city has provided guidance and eertise for several other provinces and metropolitan areas through collaborative agreements .,"in the process , shanghai ' s model has been gradually altered to reflect technological changes and the diffusion of skills among the population , which enables them to use it ."
"in , it fostered the digital beijing project , including the capital public information platform ( shoudu gongyong xinxi pingtai ) , which offers access to databases about population , traffic flows , and public offices , and allows civil service examinations to be taken online .","the zhongguancun park of science and technology , which began in in northwest beijing and grew to include corporate tenants , streamlined its administrative procedures through its haidian digital park , through which firms can file statistics , taxes , and financial reports through a "" one - stop shop "" portal ."
its digital city industrial park has attracted a cluster of software and biotechnology companies .,"the tianjin binhai new area combines the port , industrial , and free trade zones and offers numerous educational programs ."
"nanha , in the pearl river delta , developed a government network system of fiber - optic lines that connect the public with the offices of public safety , family planning , electricity distribution , taxation , weather forecasting , services for the elderly , public procurements and construction projects , and land auctions .","nanhai ' s system is regarded as one of the most successful in china , despite resistance from middle managers ( luo , beijing heralded it as an "" e - government model city .

"it offers a variety of social services and emergency notifications , and has been deployed to monitor hazardous chemical spills , traffic control and accident detection , trace tainted foods , and observe groundwater levels and quality .","chengdu , the capital of sichuan , has built a unified "" smart city "" e - government platform utilizing the city ' s cloud computing center ."
"suichang county , in zhejiang province , established a rural e - commerce portal to encourage local farmers and artisans to sell their goods online .","korla , in xinjiang or the uyghur autonomous region , implemented a smart korla development master plan , an unusual case of successful e - government in the country ' s periphery ."
"as schlaeger points out , information about the government is not the sole property of the government itself .",local propaganda agencies use them to monitor public opinion and as mouthpieces to encourage support for the state .
"they note ( p . ) "" that research on chinese state - netizen relations tends to emphasize confrontation while the more mundane and conciliatory use of social media by local governments in chinese netizens ' everyday life is often downplayed or trivialized . ""","schlaeger and min analyzed numerous government microblogs to elore whether they offered opportunities to encourage reforms or reinforce the existing political status quo , and concluded that they serve as spaces of eerimentation for improving both governance and government control , including managing social conflicts ."
china ' s conservative administrative structure has changed little as a result of e - government .,this leads municipal authorities sometimes to supply the government in beijing with false data .
contradictions arose and became ever more significant as administrative reform lagged behind economic reform .,"as a consequence of a deeply centralized and often inefficient management system , china has faced critical problems including bloated administrative structures , overstaffing , confusion between government and enterprise management , and the often unhelpful intervention of the central government in the economy ."
"such comments illustrate that simply introducing web - based technology is not enough : e - government necessitates organizational change , as well as new outlooks and culture .","similarly , holliday and yep ( 2005 , p . ) argue that "" perhaps the largest constraint on the development of e - government in china is that while it entails new modes of service delivery and information dissemination , it also goes beyond that , requiring a recasting of the mindset of the chinese bureaucrats . """
"for example , while golden tax certainly reduced tax fraud and enhanced public revenues , it barely put a dent in china ' s massive tax evasion , which is nearly universal and reflects norms that hold that taxes are inherently illegitimate .","kluver notes that e - government is a technical solution to problems that are deeply social , institutional , political , and cultural in nature ."
many municipal governments lack the financial resources to purchase adequate computers and networking equipment .,"public awareness of and participation in e - government programs remains low ( shao et al . , ) ."
"a second manifestation is that between the prosperous southern and eastern coast and lagging northern and eastern inland provinces ( tang , ) , a division exacerbated by the country ' s globalization .","the most serious is between wealthy urban areas and impoverished rural ones ( fong , ) ."
"with funding from the united nations development program , the ministry of science and technology funded a series of rural telecenters in rural wu ' an ( soriano , ; zhang , ) .","point out , the one laptop per child program has helped to provide computer skills to disadvantaged children of rural migrants ."
"to some extent , the digital divide is mitigated by the widespread use of mobile phones ( loo and ngan , ) , which have become affordable for the vast majority of the population .","particularly popular is little smart , or xiaolingtong , a low - end , ineensive mobile phone service that operates only within one city in which the user is registered ( cartier et al . , ) ."
"its obsession with political control does not help : many e - government services are provided through one - stop - shop government affairs service centers ( zhengwu fuwu zhongxin ) monitored by security cameras , which inhibit use .","it has not encouraged the growth of cybercafes , which in many countries form a primary segueway into cyberspace for those unable to afford a personal computer , although more than , 100,000 exist in the country ."
"indeed , the government manifests a clear paranoia about the liberatory power of the internet , which may give the population access to information other than that controlled by the state .","it should , of course , be recalled that china is among the most severe internet censors in the world ( warf , ) ."
"however , a large share of censorship occurs via internet companies themselves ( mackinnon , ) , which monitor chat rooms , blogs , networking services , search engines , and video sites for politically sensitive material to conform to government restrictions .",websites that help users circumvent censorship like anonymizer . com and proxify . com are prohibited .
"the chinese government has periodically initiated shutdowns of data centers housing servers for websites and online bulletin boards , disrupting use for millions .","email services like gmail and hotmail are frequently jammed ; before the olympics , facebook sites of critics were blocked ."
"in the chinese case , google , the world ' s largest single provider of free internet services , famously established a separate , politically correct ( by china ' s government standards ) website , google . cn , which censors itself to comply with restrictions demanded by the chinese state , arguing that the provision of incomplete , censored information was better than none at all ( dann and haddow , ) .","the government for years blocked access to the new york times , until its editors complained directly to president jiang zemin , but left the website for usa today unmolested ( hachigian , ) ."
"although it cannot monitor all websites in the countries , the state pursues the intimidation strategy popularly known as "" killing the chicken to scare the monkeys "" ( harwit and clark , ) .","reporters without borders reported in that china had incarcerated cyberdissidents , the most in the world ."
"china has done little to confront the digital divide and underserved rural areas ; for example , it lacks a robust series of rural telecenters such as found in india .","finally , china is one of the world ' s most aggressive censors of the internet , testimony to the fear that the ruling party has widespread access to information not channeled through the state ."
"more than % of its residents use the internet , far more than china ( 52% ) , and mobile phone penetration stands at %, making m - government far more feasible than in the rest of china ; for example , the government warned residents of the sars epidemic through text messages , and agencies were held accountable for misreporting data ( mol , ) .","wealthy , globalized , and technologically sophisticated , with roughly million inhabitants , it is not surprising that hong kong has developed a formidable e - government system ."
"the electronic transactions ordinance , enacted in , gives firms legal backing to digital signatures , and thus security to internet commercial transactions .","the trade and industry department regularly courts firms and investors digitally , has offered edi since for license and certificate of origin applications , and freely dispenses information about licenses , permits , approvals , and taxes ."
"as a country with a much higher per capita income than china , and a relatively democratic government , taiwan has both the resources and the political context to implement e - government in a democratic fashion .","with million people , taiwan ' s ert - oriented economy includes impressive industries in electronics , industrial machinery , and petrochemicals ."
taiwan ' s success in implementing e - government stands in sharp contrast to china .,"its , e - government readiness score was 2 , not far behind asia ' s leaders , south korea and singapore ."
"unlike the highly secretive chinese government , the government in taiwan has passed a variety of freedom of information acts , modeled on those in the united states , that facilitate the public ' s rights and opportunities to obtain data about their state .","for example , in , the taipei municipal government established an open data portal ( data . taipei . gov . tw ) , and by the national government followed suit ( data . gov . tw ) ."
"because citizen involvement is essential to good e - government , taiwan has opened digital channels for residents to voice their opinions and complaints .","the mayor of taipei , for example , has a special email system for this purpose , although his office is cognizant that the digital divide limits this avenue to those with internet access ( chen et al . , ) ."
"interestingly , not all interactions between these receptors and pathogenic ligands have beneficial outcomes , and it appears that some pathogens have evolved immunoevasive or immunosuppressive activities through receptors such as dc - sign .",it is now appreciated that the range of ligands interacting with c - type lectin type receptors on antigen presenting cells includes endogenous self - molecules as well as pathogens and pathogen - derived ligands .
these cells capture and process foreign antigens for presentation to t cells enabling efficient host defence and immunological memory .,"antigen - presenting cells ( apcs ) of the innate immune system include macrophages ( m s ) , dendritic cells ( dcs ) and b cells ."
"although the tlrs play a central role in alerting apcs to the presence of pathogenic material it is not clear whether they are capable of capturing and taking up antigens , and this function appears to be met by other families of prrs , most notably the c - type lectin receptors ( clrs ) and the scavenger receptors .","these interactions lead to apc maturation and migration to lymph nodes for subsequent presentation of antigenderived peptides to t cells ( for a comprehensive review , see ) ."
"clrs also bind soluble self antigens , leading to immune tolerance and maintenance of endogenous glycoprotein homeostasis .",these receptors function not only in pathogen recognition through the recognition of pamps but also in the recognition of endogenous ligands to mediate cell - cell interactions during immune responses .
"in addition to this there are type i clrs , such as mannose receptor ( mr ) and dec - 205 , which have multiple lectin - like domains , although not all of these act as functional crds .","clrs eressed by m s and dcs are predominantly type ii transmembrane receptors with a single carbohydrate recognition domain ( crd ) such as dc - sign , the related murine receptor family termed sign - related ( signr ) 1 - 4 , dectin - 2 , langerin and bdca - 2 ( blood dc antigen - 2 ) ."
"true ca + - dependent clrs fall into two broad categories , those recognizing mannose - type ligands and those recognizing galactose - type ligands , which can be defined at the molecular level by the presence of a distinctive triplet of amino acids within the crd ; epn ( in one - letter amino - acid code ) for mannose - type receptors or qpd ( in one - letter amino - acid code ) for galactose - type receptors .","additionally , receptors such as mr can recognize sulphated carbohydrates present on endogenous glycoproteins via a cysteine - rich domain independently of its crd ."
"it was subsequently also shown to bind icam - 2 on vascular endothelial cells , regulating dc migration ; both of these interactions occur through n - linked high mannose structures ( typically consisting of between five c - type lectin receptors mcgreal , miller and gordon table c - type lectin receptors that bind endogenous and egenous ligands .","the dc - sign family dc - sign was originally characterised as a receptor interacting with intercellular adhesion molecule ( icam ) - 3 , mediating dc - t - cell interactions ."
"as ligands for dc - sign also bind many other clrs , specific monoclonal antibodies have been used to assess the fate of ligands targeted through individual receptors .",such studies indicate that dc - sign targets antigens to late endosomal / lysosomal compartments for degradation and presentation to t cells .
"in the case of hiv , this interaction allows efficient transinfection of cd4 + t cells in secondary lymphoid organs .","paradoxically , it has been reported that a range of viruses , including hiv , hepatitis c virus , the recently discovered coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory disease , and dengue virus can eloit dc - sign to protect virions from the normal pathways of lysosomal degradation and presentation to t cells ."
mannosylated lipoarabinomannan ( manlam ) is a mannose - capped glycolipid found in the cell wall of m . tuberculosis .,data regarding the interaction of m . tuberculosis with dc - sign suggest that the pathogen has evolved to eloit the receptor as part of an immunoevasive strategy .
signr1 is also a non - opsonic receptor for yeasts such as candida albicans .,"although it cannot efficiently internalise antigen by itself , it might play an important role in trapping ligands at the cell surface , thereby facilitating recognition and uptake by other prrs such as dectin - 1 ."
"the mr family of multi - lectin receptors includes mr itself as well as endo - 180, dec - 205 and the phospholipase a receptor .","of these , only mr and endo - 180 have the capacity to bind carbohydrates in a ca + dependent manner via their crds ."
"mr does , however , appear to have a specialized role in the delivery of pathogen - associated glycolipids , such as lipoarabinomannan , for presentation on cd1b .",the ability of mr to enhance uptake and processing of mannosylated antigens for presentation by mhc - ii has recently been challenged by studies using transfected fibroblasts .
"although the mannose - type crd of endo - 180 has a similar ligand spectrum as mr , its role as a pathogen clearance receptor has not been investigated .","endo - 180 is best known as a fibroblast - eressed receptor for collagen , which binds collagen via an amino - terminal fibronectin type ii ( fn - ii ) domain , and endo - 180 - deficient mice have defects in collagen uptake ."
"by contrast , these mice have increased plasma concentrations of endogenous glycoproteins , such as lysosomal hydrolases , confirming an important role for mr in the clearance of self antigens .","surprisingly , mr does not appear to be essential for primary immune responses against fungal pathogens , and mr / mice are no more susceptible to infection by these pathogens than their wild - type counterparts when mortality and disseminated infection are measured ."
"the identification of dectin - 1 as a clr that mediates innate immune responses to b - 1,3 - and b - 1 , 6 linked glucans present in fungal cell walls is a major advance in our understanding of host responses to such pathogens .",the absence of immune defects in mr / mice in response to fungal pathogens highlights the presence of other prrs responsible for dealing with these microbes .
the precise signalling pathways initiated following tyrosine phosphorylation within the itam are not well understood .,"independently of tlr2 , the itam is also required for cytoskeletal rearrangements triggered through dectin - 1 preceding phagocytosis ."
"dectin - 1 , however , has features of both types of trafficking depending on the ligand used .",other receptors such as fcgr undergo de novo synthesis and are degraded in lysosomes together with their cargo .
"although the nature of this t - cell ligand is unknown , it is known that the interaction occurs through a distinct site from that mediating b - glucan recognition .","a more recent study using a short isoform of dectin - 1 indicates that it can stimulate both cd4 + and c + t cells , inducing co - stimulatory molecule eression and ifn - g production ."
further characterisation of these interactions will be vital to a full understanding of clr biology .,the absence of primary immune defects in mr / mice is surprising and it probably reflects an historical attribution of mannose inhibitable phenomena in the literature to mr before the discovery of other apc - eressed mannose - type clrs .
the coming years should further eand our knowledge of the roles played by clrs in the immune system .,the generation of knockout models for these other clrs should allow us to clarify the individual functions of these receptors in immune and non - immune phenomena .
the objective was to determine factors associated with time to neonatal gastroenteritis .,"by taking into account the ' ' intra - herd ' ' correlation in failure time ( in the semiparametric cox model ) , we identified management risk factors associated with hazard of diarrhoea ."
"we studied diarrhoea in newborn calves ( the major cause of neonatal mortality ) ( sivula et al . , a ; wells et al . , ; bendali et al . , b ) .","calves are at the greatest risk of diarrhoea during the first week of life , and this risk decreases with age ( vallet et al . , ; preventive veterinary medicine - 102 waltner - toews et al . , ) ."
"in the marginal approach , the regression coefficients have a population - averaged interpretation - whereas in the frailty model , a cluster - specific response is modeled .","in interpretation of the results , the main difference between these two approaches is the meaning of the regression coefficients ."
"the analysis was based on cox ' s proportional - hazards model ( cox , ) .","descriptive and analytical statistics were performed using s - plus ( mathsoft et al . , ) ."
"then , e b was the estimated vector of relative risks ( rrs ) , sometimes called ' ' hazard risks ' ' ( hrs ) .","where t is the observed age ( days ) when diarrhoea occurred ( or censoring time ) , h t an unknown non - parametric baseline hazard function ( which acts like a mean hazard for the whole population ) , z ij the vector of observed covariates and b the corresponding transposed vector of the regression coefficients ."
"furthermore , the family of frailty distributions is constrained to have a mean equal to for identifiability ( elbers and ridder , ) .",the frailty term allows both modelling of the intra - cluster correlation and generalization of the results from the sampled beef herds to the population of beef herds .
this grouping procedure took into account potential confounding factors and the inter - relationships between variables of the same class .,"in the second step , previously qualified variables were grouped into the same model within categories : feeding system , management , calving , housing and so on ."
a simple random stratified sampling design was used to select herds for the study .,"a prospective study on a random sample of herds in the midi - pyr n es region was conducted in departments of the southwest of france ( bendali et al . , a ) ."
a total of herds was eligible and represented % of the total herds of that region .,"the inclusion criteria consisted of herds with > 20 adult beef cows , at least three - quarters of calvings during the survey and the five most - important breeds of the region ( charolaise , limousine , gasconne , aubrac , blonde d ' aquitaine ) ."
"during this period , calves were born in the selected herds .","from randomly selected beef herds in the midi - pyr n es , were involved in this study and followed from december to april ."
"to assess passive immunity and the effectiveness of colostrum feeding , calves were sampled for total protein in the serum .","the minimum ' ' satisfactory ' ' level of this total protein concentration was g / l ( perino et al . , ; rea et al . , ) ."
"the ambient - weather variables ( temperature , dampness ) were recorded at the visit closest to the date of birth of each calf .","we calculated a parameter which took into account external and internal temperatures and dampness simultaneously ( andrieu et al . , ) ; this method allows a single efficient measurement of atmospheric conditions to be used for each calf in accordance with birth ."
the univariable screening procedure identified more than variables associated with diarrhoea ( p < : 2 ) in the neonatal period .,"among the variables the most positively associated with hazard of diarrhoea ( table ) , were the dam vaccination against other agents , the presence of ammonia and the cleaning after calving season ( 1.54 and 5 ) ."
"moreover , a high incidence of diarrhoea in the previous season and dystocia increased the hazard .",the hazard of diarrhoea was higher in calves born in march than those born in december .
we noted that hygiene and cleanliness seemed to have an impact on the time to diarrhoea .,"newborn calves had a higher hazard of diarrhoea when stalls were not cleaned after the calving season , and when dams were not clean ( as was observed in % of the farms ) ."
"in addition , newborn calves which require assistance during parturition can be weakened for long periods after birth , and thus become eed to more faecal pathogens than calves which stand up shortly after birth .","difficult calving causes stress for the newborn calf , which decreases resistance to pathogens owing to a combination of reduced calf vigour and delayed ingestion of colostrum ."
"in contrast to previous studies ( roy , ; schumman et al . , ; sivula et al . , b ) , dyspnea was not associated with the hazard of diarrhoea .",one elanation might be that the most calves ( 92.9% ) had adequate respiration at birth .
two uneected negative associations were found with the cleaning after each diarrhoea episode and the cleaning before each calving season .,one possible elanation is that farmers with herds with a history of disease would be more likely to clean and disinfect locations .
"having dams vaccinated against agents such as bovine viral diarrhoea and clostridium perfringens - but not against e . coli - rotavirus and coronavirus , seems to decrease the hazard of diarrhoea .",this result could be elained by a general good management of the herd .
"although the hazard risk remained < 1 in our study , the effect was no longer significant in these robust approaches .","the initial study ( bendali et al . , b ) found an uneected negative association between dam vaccination with e . coli and calf diarrhoea ."
feeding corn silage has been associated with an increased hazard of diarrhoea .,"one elanation might be that feeding additional corn silage could induce a transient increase in blood triglyceride and blood urea nitrogen , which may contribute to the hazard of diarrhoea ."
herds with high incidences of diarrhoea in the previous calving season were more likely to show this high rate ( hr : 45 in the fcm ) .,this result may be elained by the fact that herd management did not change markedly from one season to the next and the concentration of pathogens remained roughly constant .
the consequence is that providing advises to farmers should simultaneously takes several parameters into account .,"our results showed that it is not easy to identify separately individual effects of several management practices , and very often , many factors are associated ."
conclusions regarding factors influencing the hazard of diarrhoea in neonatal calves from the two different models ( with correlation taken into account ) were similar .,"hazards were higher when cows were not vaccinated ( against a variety of specific agents ) , calvings needed assistance , cows were not clean , the building smelled of ammonia , and calfdiarrhoea incidence was > 5% the previous year ."
"reactive morphological changes of microglia , which are immuno - reactive to the antibodies to f4 / 80 and / or mac - l , were demonstrated in areas corresponding to those of neuronal degeneration , coincident with the emergence of cells eressing major histocompatibility complex class ii , ia , antigen .","the antibodies to macrophage specific antigen , f4180 and to type - three complement receptor , mac - i were used for the study ."
"more recently , microglia and brain macrophages have drawn the special attention of many investigators because of their presumed active roles in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( aids ) , alzheimer ' s disease and multiple sclerosis s ' 14 . t ~ ' 2 ' 27 ' 2 s ' 3 .",reactions of microglia to neuronal damage have been investigated eerimentally in - hydroxydopamine - induced lesions in the substantia nigra t and in the facial nerve nuclei induced either by atomy ts or by an intra - anal injection of toxic ricin .
"in this murine mutant , neuronal degeneration gradually develops around the postnatal day ( p ) 10 , and death usually occurs before reaching p15 with extensive neuronal degeneration .",chronological events of neuronal degeneration in this mutant have been studied in detail s .
the colony of brindled mice was maintained by interbreeding of the offspring .,"the mice used in the eeriments were offsprings of a brindled heterozygous female ( c3h / hej - mobr ' j / + ) and a c57bl / 6 j male , originally from the jackson laboratory ( bar harbor , maine , usa ) ."
"following the methods applied previously s , normal pups were allowed to be fed only h per day from p5 and killed at p8 , or .",the body weights of these mice were comparable to those of hemizygous mice .
immune - reactive cells were identified on the section and the block trimmed for thin sectioning .,one thick sections were stained with toluidine blue and examined with a light microscope .
"there appeared to be some delay in differentiation of microglia in these mice and even on pi0 , primitive microglia were still well recognized in the cerebral cortex ( data not shown ) .","however , reactive mi - crogliajmacrophages were never seen in the cerebrum of these mice ."
ia positive cells could be detected in the leptomeninges and choroid plexuses but rarely in the brains of control mice at any age .,"when they were found in the brail ~ , they tended to be located adjacent to blood vessels ."
"after p10 , with progression of neuronal degeneration , various shaped mac - 1 positive cells ( reactive microglia / macrophages ) emerged in the brains of brindled hemizygous mice .","in the brindled hemizygous mice , there appeared to be more immature microglia on p5 suggesting some delay in maturation but such a difference was no longer ap - preciated on p7 when the majority of microglia were ramified in both hemizygous and control brains ."
"mac - 1 positive reactive microglia / macrophages appeared on pl0 predominantly in the regions where neuronal degeneration was noted , suggesting that degenerating neurons release some signals or factors causing such morphological transformation of microglia .","our previous neuropathological study of brindled hemizygous mice showed that in the cingulate cortex early neuronal changes , as manifested by enlargement of mitochondria , became noticeable as early as ' 4 but neuronal degeneration was observed after pl0 s ' s ~ ."
"although mechanisms and / or regulation of microglial transformations in vivo are not well understood , several factors such as gamma interferon , the interleukins and granulocytes / macrophage colony stimulating factor ( ( 3 / m - csf ) are known to induce microglial transformations in vitro ~ ' ~ 2'46 .","thus , the pronounced immuno - reactivity of these reactive microglia / macrophages with mab - mac - 1 may indicate elevated cellular functions that include phagocytic , secretory or adhesive capacities s ' ts ' 39,49 ."
"when we studied gfap immuno - reactivity of astrocytes on p12 , preferential distribution of strongly immuno - reactive astrocyte ~ was recognized in the areas corresponding to neuronal degeneration .",reported intensely gfap immuno - reactive astrocytes throughout the cortex in the hemizygous brindled mouse on p1537 .
"in the central nervous system , ia eression was reported in varieties of cell types including microglia ls ' 26 ' 3 s ' 44'47 and was thought to be related to immunomediated disease processes such as multiple sclerosis , eerimental allergic encephalomyelitis ( eae ) , eerimental allergic neuritis ( ean ) , etc .",ia eressing cells have been considered to play an important role in the initiation of cellular immune response ' 4 s .
"alternatively , it is possible that some immunological mechanisms are involved in cellular degeneration in these pathological conditions in humans as well as in eerimental animals .","in the twitcher mouse with major pathological changes in the white matter , ia eressing cells were more numerous in the white matter ~ 9 , while in the brindled mouse with pronounced neuronal degeneration , ia eressing cells were found strictly in the gray matter ."
this result suggests that the information about ebola outbreak events is more relevant for companies that are geographically closer to both the birthplace of the ebola outbreak events and the financial markets .,"the results also show that the effect is more pronounced for small and more volatile stocks , stocks of specific industry , and for the stocks eed to the intense media coverage ."
one of the central issues in the behavioral finance literature is to elain why some market participants make seemingly irrational decisions .,"a relatively large number of studies show that "" bad mood "" and anxiety may affect investor sentiment ."
"in more recent studies , levy ( 2 0 1 0 a , b ) study the impact of sporting games and aviation disasters on investor sentiment .","early studies observe , for instance , that the weather , which is a wellknown driver of peoples ' mood , tends to positively commove with daily stock returns ( hirshleifer and shumway , ) ."
we find negative cumulative abnormal returns on the event day and a reversal effect one day after the event .,possible reason for this effect may be that investors act irrationally to the news on the ebola outbreak and after one day they stabilize their behavior .
we find that the ebola outbreak event effect is the strongest for the stocks of companies with eure of their operations to the wac and the u . s . for the events located in the wac and the u . s .,this result suggests that the information about ebola outbreak events is more relevant for companies that are geographically closer to both the birthplace of the ebola outbreak events and the financial markets .
we find that the negative effect of the ebola outbreak events is more pronounced for small companies relative to large companies .,a potential elanation for this effect is that information dissemination is less effective for small cap stocks compared to large cap stocks .
"next , we examine whether the ebola outbreak events affect investor sentiment proxied by the implied volatility .",the results show that implied volatility increases following the ebola outbreak event days but then subsides - indicating a mood - driven effect .
we find evidence that the event effect is stronger for the securities eed to the intense media coverage than for the securities receiving less media eure .,"lastly , we evaluate the magnitude of the effect from the ebola outbreak events for securities highly eed in the media and securities belonging to a specific industry ."
the main hypothesis of this study asserts that the geographic proximity increases the impact of the information related to the - 2016 ebola outbreak on the financial markets .,"this hypothesis relies on the observed relations between : companies ' eure to different geographic regions of operation , companies ' size and type of industry in which they operate , the media coverage of disease outbreak , the fear , and anxiety that ebola outbreak provokes , and investors ' risk aversion to invest when fear and anxiety increase ."
"our study is also related to levy ( 2 0 1 0 a , b ) , who study the impact of sporting games and aviation disasters on investor sentiment .",they show that aviation disasters negatively affect investor sentiment and increase the fear for trading few days after the event .
our study contributes to this strand of literature by joining investor sentiment and the information flow from the geographically dispersed ebola disease events .,it adds up to the literature by examining investors ' willingness to invest under the ebola saturated state of mood .
several other studies observe the impact of a media coverage on specific industries .,huberman and regev perform a case study to observe the financial market effects of a media coverage of a major breakthrough in cancer research .
their study finds that a local press coverage increases the trading volume of local investors up to %.,"to identify the role of a geographic proximity , engelberg and parsons measure media effects on stock returns at a local level ."
we divide the events in two categories : who reports and u . s . newspapers ebola outbreak news .,events considered to be who reports are obtained from the official who website .
the who reports that we encounter are official statements communicated to the public with regard to any new information related to the - 2016 ebola outbreak .,"for example , on october , , the first death case on the u . s . soil was publicly reported by the who ."
such a strategy helps ensure the independence of subsequent as well as sequential announcements .,"for this reason , the sample of announcements considers only those updates documenting a news - event for the first time ( e . g . , the first - time cross - border transmission , the first - time announcement of a death case in the u . s . ) ."
"second , the u . s . stock markets are among the leading stock markets in the world and account for almost % of the global market ( hou et al . , ) .","first , they are the most closely followed in the world , thus very efficient with respect to dissemination of new information levy , a , b ) ."
"to ensure unbiased selection and categorization of the companies for each portfolio , we use the following four - step procedure .","first , we select the printed and online subscription coverage on a national level is considered ."
"r . ichev , m . marin international review of financial analysis - 166 companies by status : we are interested in active and publicly listed companies .","second , we further select the companies that have a domicile in the u . s . third , we match each company according to its operation ownership with the specific country or region of operation ( i . e . , towards its eure to the u . s . , the wac , and europe ) ."
"to further analyze a potential differential effect regarding the company industry , company size , and stock volatility , we employ fama and french ' s value - weighted portfolios constructed by size and volatility , obtained from the crsp .",the industry based portfolio is created by selecting the largest industries by contribution to the u . s . gdp in the period from january to june .
"to do this as well as to match each event with the corresponding stock or company , we refer to the lexisnexis ' s database for global news and business information .","to observe whether the intensity of a media coverage has a significant impact on specific companies , from the event category u . s . newspapers ebola outbreak news , we build a subsample of events ( or in this case , newspaper articles ) which we consider as heavily covered in the media ."
"we position days in the estimation window and days in the event window - 5 days prior and days after the event day noted as day ( for more on event study designs , see mackinlay , ) .",the abnormal returns ( ars ) are defined as the difference between the actual rate of return of the stock considered and its et eected rate of return over the whole length of the event window .
"for this reason , we use only events with nonoverlapping event windows ( there is such events ) .","hence , the event study would suffer from overlapping windows if all events were considered ."
the first selection criterion is labelled as the last occurrence and chooses an event only if it is not followed by another event within days after its occurrence .,the second selection criterion is labelled as the first occurrence and selects events in chronological order ( sequence ) .
"following french , schwert ( 1 9 9 0 a ) , and cho et al .","in our case , it is the rates of return of the first five previous days ."
"the "" monday "" or "" weekend effects "" theory states that returns on the stock market on monday will follow the trend from the previous friday .","for more evidence on the effect , see cho , linton and whang ."
"second , we hypothesize that the event effect is stronger for the stock returns of small companies relative to large companies .","this hypothesis is supported by the past research suggesting that local investors are usually the ones investing in small firms , thus their sentiment is affected by event information that is specific to the place and firm that they invest into ( see , brown and cliff , ; edmans et al . , ) ."
"having this in mind , we select the largest industries , by contribution to the u . s . gdp , and test how ( positively or negatively ) the ebola outbreak events affect each industry .",we anticipate companies from the pharmaceutical and biotechnological industry to be positively affected whereas the companies from aviation and tourism sectors to eerience a negative impact .
we hypothesize that the companies eed to the intense media coverage are more affected by the ebola outbreak events than the companies that receive less media eure .,"fifth , previous studies confirm that the intense media coverage significantly affects stock returns , trading volume , stock liquidity , and stock variability ( see , fang and peress , ) ."
more evidence on these effects can be found in table a . 5 .,"similarly to the single factor model , the cars for the companies with eure of their operations to the u . s . only and to the wac region are negative ( 145 with t - value of 63 for the u . s . and 192 with t - value of 62 for the wac region ) and larger compared to the cars for the companies with eure of their operations to europe ( 135 with t - value of 25 ) ."
decile ( smallest firms ) and decile ( highest volatility ) show stronger negative cars compared to the large and least volatile stocks ( see also tables a . 6 and a . 7 ) .,"furthermore , we find that aviation companies are the most negatively affected by the ebola outbreak events whereas the companies producing healthcare equipment are on the other extreme and benefited the most ( see fig ."
"overall , our event study analysis points to a negative impact of the ebola outbreak events towards the u . s . companies ' stock returns .",we stress that the event study results are weaker than the regression results reported in the next section due to the fact that only out of events were employed in the car analysis - as a result of the event nonoverlapping selection criteria .
"similarly , the monday coefficient is negative and the "" turn - of - the - year effect "" coefficient is positive and significant at least at % level .","coefficients for the other days of the week are mostly negative but insignificant ( see kaplanski and levy , b ; schwert , a schwert , , b for similar results ) ."
"where r i , t is the rate of return of stock i on day t with eure of its operations towards the u . s . , the wac region , europe , or all regions , is the regression intercept , r i , t j is the lagged dependent variable - the jth previous day rate of return , wd k , t with k = , , are dummy variables for the day of the week ( monday , tuesday , wednesday , and thursday ) , tax t is a dummy variable for the first five days of the taxation year , and el l , t with l = , , and , are dummy variables that denote the location where the event happened and equal on the event day if the event happened in a specific region ( either in the u . s . , the wac region , and europe ) , and zero otherwise .",the events occurred during the - 2016 ebola outbreak period ( 3 - year period ) and include a total number of event days of the disease outbreak .
our results do not rule out the existence of an effect for the fourth and fifth day after the main event day but rather suggest that we could not observe it .,we record no statistically significant coefficients on the fourth and fifth day following the main event day .
"first , the investors feel that the u . s . only and the wac region related companies are closer to the birthplace of the ebola outbreak events , and thus , assume more relevance for ( not ) investing in them .","second , the media coverage affects investor sentiment especially for the companies with eure of their operations to the u . s . and the wac region than for the companies with eure of their operations to europe ."

"due to the disparity between the small and large stocks , media can especially influence small stocks , for which the information dissemination is limited .",a potential elanation could posit that the information dissemination of small stocks is poorer than the information dissemination of large stocks .
"we employ two measures of the fear index , the vix and v ( see whaley , ) .","following baker and wurgler who use implied volatility as a proxy for investor sentiment , we next test whether ebola outbreak events affect the implied volatility ."
"for example , schwert analyzes a long - time period of market volatility and finds that the monthly stock volatility was higher during banking crises and economic recessions .","however , the increase in the volatility may also be due to an increase in the actual market volatility , which may coincidentally occur at the same time as the ebola outbreak ."
"inspired by their study , we examine the ebola outbreak event effect on various groups of stocks ( volatile vs . non - volatile ) .","table reports the results , where each dependent variable is the daily rate of return on a portfolio composed of stocks that are divided into deciles with respect to stock volatility ."
"the regression coefficient on the day of the event is larger , negative , and highly significant for the most volatile stocks compared to the regression coefficient for the less volatile stocks , which is consistent with our third hypothesis in section .","our results show that the event effect is intact for all deciles , except for decile ."
the stock returns of these four industries are positively affected by the ebola outbreak .,"the results from table confirm our eectations , revealing evidence for the industry effect ."
"a potential elanation is that investors anticipate an increase in cash flows for the industries due to , for example , investing in r & d or selling new medicines aimed at fighting the new pandemic disease .",the results are related to hirshleifer and shumway who find that innovative efficiency and citations scaled by r & d eenditures positively determine future stock returns .
the first line reports the regression coefficients whereas the second line reports the corresponding t - values ( in brackets ) .,"one , two , and three asterisks indicate a significance level of %, %, and %, respectively ."
the stock price reactions to the events are stronger for securities that are eed to intense media coverage ( see panel a and panel b of table ) .,we test whether the companies eed to the intense media coverage are more affected by the ebola outbreak events than the ones receiving less media eure .
the event dates ( denoted as t = ) are considered to be the official pheic statements .,the number of articles is normalized relative to its peak value over the - day period .
"past research documents that uneected and high - consequence events contribute to the trade turbulence in the markets increasing the volume of trades enentially ( peress , ) .",the coefficients of the proxies for stock variability and liquidity - the price range and the bid - ask spread - increase only on the day of the event and they trend downward subsequently .
"to sum up , our results support the view that not only the event but also the intensity of the media coverage induces the effect in the stock market .",the collective fear and shock of the disastrous event amplify the consequences of the event itself .
", and peress , ) may impose a strong transitory decline in the financial markets which is very different from the direct economic loss , we look for an elanation in the realm of behavioral finance .","indeed , behavioral finance studies show that the media coverage of drastic events such as ebola outbreak events can enhance anxiety , bad mood , and fear which may induce risk aversion and pessimism among the investors ."
we find that the event effect is present in all regions of interest .,we confirm that the geographic proximity of the information to the financial markets increases the importance of the event ( related to the - 2016 ebola outbreak ) and its impact on companies ' stock returns .
"we find that the implied volatility , as reflected through vix and v , significantly increases on the day of the event , which may imply that the ebola outbreak events also affect investors ' perceived risk .","in addition , we observe persistence of the effect on the first day following the event day whereas we observe no return to the prevailing average value before the event ."
we find that the event effect is stronger for securities that are eed to the intense media coverage compared to securities less covered in the media .,"our research confirms findings from the past research that high - consequence and low - probability events , such as the ebola outbreak events , are overemphasized in the media and create sentiment effects ."
"current knowledge of the structures and biological functions of the human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) system provides a framework for unraveling the mechanisms of one of the most puzzling enigmas of modern biology and medicine , which consists of the definite associations among components of the system and genetic susceptibility or resistance to disease ( dausset , ) .","although known for over years , this phenomenon is only now beginning to be understood in molecular terms ."
during the past years fastidious attempts have been undertaken to improve the identification of the most significant hla components involved in genetic associations .,"however , since the hla system displays the unusual feature of a strong linkage disequilibrium between loci and alleles , the genetic traits found to be associated with disease did not emerge at random ."
"this is best illustrated in the case of insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus ( iddm ) , which was initially found to be associated with alleles within the a , then the b , locus and finally the hla - d region .","among the hla - associated diseases , or at least for those diseases in which an autoimmune process is suspected to be directly relevant to the pathogenesis , the associations are with genes and molecules of the hla - d region ( hla class i1 genes and products ) ."
"however , the exact nature of the antigens ( foreign or self ) remains enigmatic as the potential influence of the t cell receptors ( tcr ) repertoires .","this would lead to inappropriate antigen presentation and t cell activation , resulting in an impaired immune response ."
these two hypotheses have practical implications for selecting the most pertinent typing approach in studies of disease susceptibility .,"is the disease susceptibility associated with one or a few contiguous specific linearly displayed amino acids , or with several amino acids ( or sets of amino acids ) distantly spaced in the molecule , creating a unique three - dimensional conformation ?"
"because of the strong linkage disequilibrium between loci and alleles , i feeljustified in restricting the description of the genetic associations to only the most recent data ( mainly generated by molecular means ) , since they supercede in precision and accuracy the previous data obtained by serological methods .","this chapter focuses strictly on the hla mhc class i1 genes and molecules with regard to how they contribute to better delineation of the genetic associations and how the current knowledge of their structure , eression , and functions can be used to speculate on their role in the pathogenesis of disease ."
such approaches are intended to identify which hla molecules confer the highest susceptibility or resistance to a disease and how they contribute to disease development .,"i discuss the central contribution of three - dimensional conformational structures of the hla class i1 mole - cules and emphasize in particular the possibilities generated by the formation of hybrid hla class i1 molecules , the prominent role of which has been highlighted by the most recent epidemiological studies of disease susceptibility ."
"the human mhc class i1 genes are located on a segment of chromosome and consist of several sets of a - / 3 species , for a total of - 15 individual genes per haplotype .","three major subregions - namely , dr , dq , and dp - are identified by their cell surface - eressed products , consisting of one a - fl dimer each for dq and dp and one or two concomitantly eressed a - p dimers for dr , depending on the haplotype ( e . g . , dra - drb1 and dra - drb3 or dra - drb4 ) ( korman et al . , ; kappes and strominger , ) ."
"overall , mhc class i1 genes are characterized by two apparently opposing structural features , both of which are critical to our understanding of the system .","first , the hla class i1 genes and proteins are homologous to each other ( as well as among species ) ."
"the crystal structure of one hla class i molecule has recently been obtained , and , because of the overall similarity in amino acid composition and general secondary conformation of classes i and i1 molecules , it was subsequently used to create a three - dimensional model for class i1 molecules ( bjorkman et al . , ; brown et al . , ) .",these structural variations between the class i1 gene products are the fundamental differences permitting immune recognition and are therefore likely to be critical in disease susceptibility .
"thus , a model is provided for the binding of foreign or self - peptides and for the identification of the putative contact sites between the peptides and the class i1 residues .","when the model is compared with a bulk of published and unpublished serological , functional , and genetic data , residues which are monoclonal antibody epitopes ( i . e . , protruding into the solvent ) or class ii - restricted t cell recognition epitopes ( i . e . , facing into the site or upward ) can be predicted ."
additional genes are present which are not regularly eressed or are eressed at low levels .,"platform for the two first hypervariable regions ( amino acids - 13 and - 33 ; hvrl and hvr2 , respectively ) , while the major hvr region ( hvr3 ) from amino acids to ( extending to amino acid and centered on amino acids - 74 ) is located on turns of the a - helical structure ."
"examples of supertypic epitopes are numerous ; dr2 and dr4 specificities are found on several different hla molecules ( lea , interallelic epitopes ) ( wu et al . , ; t . .","drw52 can be found on different alleles of the same gene ( drbs ) but also on a different gene product ( drb ) ( haziot et al . , ) ."
this elains the interest in studying hla and disease associations in these groups .,such recombination is rarely found within a homogeneous population and is more frequently found between different ethnic groups .
"since there are only officially recognized hla - dr typing serological specificities ( hla nomenclature ) and the structural variation accounts for over alleles , most of the serologically defined specificities are likely to be supertypic .","moreover , since serological reagents were selected through allorecognition , they are not necessarily suitable for detecting disease susceptibility epitopes ."
"this approach is particularly pertinent in the case of hybrid determinants ( i . e . , determinants created by the formation of particular a - p heterodimers , as discussed below ) for which no serological reagent is available .","this approach would not only be invaluable for epidemiological studies , but should be ultimately considered for epitope - specific therapy ."
"furthermore , it represents the best technique for definition of the reactivity of mab ' s in association , eventually , with immunodetection by western blotting of their individual chains or complex reactivity .","the first dimension ( of a two - dimensional page ) can be nonequilibrium ph gradient electrophoresis or ief , which provides better resolution of the class i1 fl and a chains , respectively ."
"apart from the genetic polymorphism , biochemical studies of hla class i1 molecules are also of interest in the study of the diversity of eression of class i1 molecules in cells of the diseased organs in which they may appear in an aberrant manner .","the use of silver staining instead of radioactivity in two - dimensional page and the development of western blotting and ief may provide more simple ways to perform biochemical typing for hla class i1 in the near future ( hermans et al . , a ; rodriquez de cordoba et al . , ) ."
"rflp analysis is based on length variation of fragments , resulting from the cleavage of specific genomic dna at polymorphic restriction sites , as revealed by southern blotting .","the use of rflp became popular a few years ago , in the hla field in particular , for the study of hla class i1 and disease association bell et al . , ) ."
"however , it was hoped that this genomic approach would identify new genetic markers uniquely associated with and specific for a disease .","indeed , had these markers existed , this approach may have localized in the hla region non - hla disease susceptibility genes ."
"however , these procedures do not provide any advantage with regard to definition and have some drawbacks .","integrated dna rflp typing strategies and procedures have been developed ( bidwell et al . , ; cohen , ) which are convenient tools for the investigation of hla polymorphism in large population samples ."
it is at present unclear whether regulatory sequences ( 5 ' upstream promoters and enhancers ) have any genetic variability .,"moreover , interest is increasing in studying the regulation of individual hla class i1 gene eression which may affect disease states ."
"this technique was rapidly combined with the polymerase chain reaction procedure , which greatly facilitates the obtaining of specific dna sequences suitable for further analysis ( by rflp or aso ) ( saiki et al . , ( saiki et al . , , .","as0 is an additional molecular technique which has been introduced to circumvent the inability of cdna probes to identify some hla class i1 splits , particularly the different dr4 dw haplotypes ."
"ultimately , the comparison of sequences of every class i1 gene ( a + ) from normal versus diseased cells will be attained .",this will undoubtedly focus interest on relevant amino acids and stretches of amino acids which are important for conferring high susceptibility to a particular disease .
"in addition to the number of class i1 a - p loci combined two by two within a haplotype to form isotypes , a powerful way to increase class i1 antigen diversity would be the association of the a and p chains of the two haplotypes by tramcomplementation within an isotype .","thus , particularly for disease associations , an appreciation of the full repertoire of class i1 dimers has to be evaluated ."
the use of allele - specific mab ' s directed uniquely at the dq a or p chain resulted in the isolation of hybrid ( dq ) molecules .,"indeed , the dq a and p chains are both highly polymorphic giles et al . , ) ."
a dqw2 ( dr7 ) p - dqwl ( dr1 ) a hybrid molecule was the first to be demonstrated in humans in a dr1 - dr7 heterozygous cell line .,our own approach included the use of two - dimensional page to detect and identify electrophoretic variants of dq molecules .
eeriments with ' 251 surface - labeled antigens demonstrated that these hybrid molecules were also eressed at the cell surface .,the lack of adequate reagents elains the limited work that has been published since our first demonstration of hybrid dq a - dq p molecules in heterozygous individuals .
"indeed , such sera would only recognize heterozygous individuals and would not segregate with a given hla haplotype in family studies .","alternatively , it may be that these determinants are less immunogenic in terms of alloantibody response ."
transfectants containing hybrid molecules will provide an exquisite tool for the production and screening of hybrid - specific antibodies which can be subsequently used in epidemiological studies .,"while in the mouse the ir gene tram - complementation phenomenon is unequivocally elained on the basis of hybrid ia molecules , among the mixedlymphocyte reaction - stimulating determinants there appear to be some that represent conformational epitopes created by the trans - association of a and p chains ( fathman , ) ."
"as a consequence , the relative risk is dramatically higher in some heterozygous situations than for any unique allele , even when present in a homozygous state .",such data cannot be elained by the model of monoallelic association .
"if hla class i1 molecules are involved , it becomes logical to propose that the particular determinant derives from a combination of products , one from the first haplotype , the other from the second haplotype .","because of the lack of polymorphism in the dr ( y chain , it is unlikely that hla - dr molecules themselves would be the structural basis of this heterozygous effect ."
"recent work in the mouse using appropriate combinations of transfected genes has shown that , while haplotype - matched a a - p genes ( haplotypes k , b , d ) resulted in the optimum cell surface eression of the dimers ( as one would eect from the biochemical studies previously conducted in normal cells ) , the level of eression of haplotype - mismatched a a - / i dimers was extremely variable and depended on the combination of haplotypes used .","as an example , a ak - pb transfectants had poor surface ia eression , while a ak - pd transfectants had no detectable ia at their surface ."
"although some dq a and / 3 genes have never been found to occur in cis in the population , this may not preclude the possibility that they occur in rare cases or even in trans ( bontrop et al . , ) .",the inability of certain dq a and / 3 chains to form functional dimers has yet to be demonstrated in humans .
"however , several other factors have not yet been investigated which could interfere with hybrid molecule formation .","these include numerous posttranslational processing events and quantitative regulatory mechanisms , some of which are noticeably different in mice and humans ( nee1 et al . , ) ."
"this is clearly a possibility for the dp subset , both subunits of which are structurally polymorphic ( ando et al . , ; lotteau et al . , a ) .","while the total lack of structural polymorphism in the dr a gene and protein means that there is no difference in whether the constitutive a chain of a dr a - / 3 dimer is coded for by either parental chromosome , other class i1 subsets are potential candidates for generating intraisotypic hybrid molecules ."
a series of laboratory eeriments using normal epstein - barr virus - transformed human b cell lines provides direct evidence for the assembly and the cell surface eression of mixed isotypes consisting of dr a and dq p chains .,"isotypemismatched molecules were therefore considered forbidden pairs and were not eected to be found at the surface of normal cells ( travers et al . , ) ."
"furthermore , this work emphasized the uneected influence of the polymorphic nh2terminal domain of the i - a p molecule in permitting pairing , since the i - e a chain is virtually nonpolymorphic .","this unorthodox pairing appears to be predominantly influenced by the allelic polymorphism of the i - a / chains , since the i - a / i - i - e a complex could be detected as an i - e a - i - a pd dimer , but not as an i - e a - 1 - a pk or i - a pb dimer ."
"in normal cells the situation is more complex , since each a or / chain has the opportunity to pair with its homologous chain ( in cis or trans ) and eventually with the chains of other isotypes ( in cis or trans ) .","it should be remembered that , in the case of transfected genes , the q and / chains have no alternative partner with which to pair ."
we have observed that a permissive haplotype does not automatically result in the appearance of an interisotypic heterodimer .,we therefore investigated the amount of individual a - p chain mrna present in epstein - barr virus b cell lines in which biochemical analysis was unable to detect the presence or absence of isotype - mismatched a - / 3 pairs .
"this , in turn , results in the extinction of the dr a - dq / isotypemismatched pair .","in a second series of eeriments , cells naturally eressing dr a - dq / 3 dimers were transfected with a dr a antisense cdna ."
whether isotype - mismatched molecules are important in the physiology of the immune response is an open question .,the fact that few data are available may be due to the presumption that they were nonexistent .
"similarly , transfectants containing various combinations of mixed a - / 3 isotype pairs should be suitable targets .","new tools can be designed to search for such sera , and mutant cells ( deleted of genes for one or several chains ) should be very useful ."
"they could account for the contribution of both dr and dq or dp subregions to susceptibility to a particular disease , as was recently suggested in cd and multiple sclerosis ( ms ) .",interisotypic class i1 dimers are indeed suitable to provide a structural basis for any haplotypic effect within the hla - d region which might be found in epidemiological studies .
the suggestions that specific conformation within hla class i1 dimers may represent a critical element for susceptibility and that hybrid class i1 molecules occur either by cis or trans - complementation within an isotype ( s ) are discussed below in the context of well - characterized diseases .,"for this purpose i review the data on ra , iddm , cd , and ms which are most relevant to the structural and functional framework of the hla class i1 molecules provided ."
"approximately % of ra patients are dr4 , versus % in controls ( stasny , ) .","thus , the dr4 haplotypes became the most - studied hla class i1 factors ."
"among these subtypes only two - dw4 and dw14 - are prevalent in ra and account for the found association with ra in caucasian studies , while dwlo appears neutral .","great effort was then devoted to biochemical dissection of the molecular basis of the alloreactive splits of the dr4 haplotypes , which in turn helped to define the ra - associated haplotypes ."
"this can be elained by the fact that the nucleotide variation affected a limited area of the gene , therefore probably corresponding to recent evolutionary processes with conservation of the restriction sites .","it is of interest to note that previous southern blot rflp studies , although usually efficient in revealing allelic diversity , were not very informative in the case of the dr4 haplotypes , notwithstanding their extensive diversity ."
"although several dr4 haplotypes are found to be positively associated with ra in different ethnic groups ( e . g . , dw4 and dw14 in caucasians and dw in the japanese ) , dr4 is not associated with ra in other ethnic groups , such as jews or asian indians .","while dwlo is the most common dr4 haplotype in jews , it is almost completely absent among ra patients , suggesting that dwlo in this population is probably "" protective , "" or at least neutral ."
this parallels the fact that dr1 is one of the least variable haplotypes among ethnic groups .,"moreover , dr is overrepresented in the group of dr4 - ra patients , irrespective of the ethnic group ."
"interestingly , mc represents highest single determinant associated with ra , since in a recent study of patients mcl is present in % of the patients and % of the controls ( carpenter et al . , ) .","this illustrates that , although supertypic ( i . e . , present on several distinct molecules ) , some "" epitope "" once identified may be of better value in predicting susceptibility haplotypes to a disease than a precise class i1 molecular subtype ."
"similar data were reported concerning the reactivity of d6 mab ' s , which recognizes an epitope on drw53 molecules ( lee et al . , ) .","the risk for ra appears to be higher for d6 than for dr4 , since d6 was found in a greater number of individuals with ra than those who are either dr4 or drw53 ."
"indeed , non - dr4 non - drw53 d6 ' ra individuals were found to possess drw molecules by assessed serology .","moreover , the individuals analyzed so far were reported to be also dr1 on the other haplotype ."
"positions , 70 , and have conserved residues , except for a relatively conservative lysine - to - arginine substitution at position in dw4 .","this contrasts with dr4 - dwlo ( a neutral or protective haplotype ) , in which positions , , and are consistently substituted similarly to those which are found in most of the dr2 p chain and which have been claimed to be protective for ra , at least in caucasians ( dw2 ) and in the japanese ( dw12 ) ( maeda et al . , ; ohta et al . , ) ."
in other studies t cell clones have been found to recognize shared determinants between dr1 and dr4 ra haplotypes .,"overall , the data localize the functional ra - associated ( i . e . , shared ) epitope to an area of the dr p l molecule common to dr1 , dr4w4 , and dr4w14 ( also dw15 and dw16 ) ."
"interestingly , in the mouse a mutant , bm12 , shows that a structural epitope can be fully exchanged between an i - e and an i - a p chain and remain fully functional ( mengle - gaw et al . , ) .","considering the above concepts , it could be that t cell clones would be the most specific tools to be used in disease susceptibility analysis ."
this would result in the initiation of a self - t cell activation and further autoimmunity .,the concept of molecular mimicry was logically proposed based on the assumption that an environmentally provided antigen could exist which would induce t cell recognition of the previously defined disease susceptibility epitope .
"since an arginine - to - lysine substitution is considered conservative , this sequence is reminiscent of the qrraa or qkraa sequences present at residues - 74 in the hypervariable region of several ra susceptibility dr p alleles .","these include drl , dr4w4 , dr4w14 , and dr4w15 ( roudier et al . , ) ."
"thus , the self - antigen - mimicry hypothesis requires further dissection of the t cell responses , the tcr repertoire , and the peptides involved .","however , no evidence was provided that the t cells involved were recognizing identical epitopes , since they could also be overlapping epitopes ( roudier et al . , ) ."
"the isolation of heat - shock protein - specific t cell clone from an ra patient ( holoshitz et al . , ) is puzzling , and the isolated clone ' s being y - 6 is even more enigmatic .","although the anticollagen type i1 response is under mhc control in several animal models , the data from humans cannot conclusively validate the hypothesis of a central role for this latter molecule in ra ."
"the latest data suggest that the dpbw2 . 1 allele found in jra patients is independent of the dr5 and drw8 specificities ( h . erlich , personal communication ) .","however , one should wait until we know the dpa allele present in these patients , since the best disease linkage may well be subsequent to an isotype - mismatched dr p - dp a molecule ."
"indeed , numerous abnormalities of hla eression have been observed in ra patients .","the most relevant finding is an aberrantly high eression on the synovial tissue , in particular , on the adherent synovial lining cells of the hla class i1 species ."
"furthermore , we have recently shown that synovial cell proliferation could be modulated by anti - hla class i1 antibodies ( teyton et al . , ) .",the class i1 molecules could therefore provide to the synovial cells an intracellular signal which affects proliferation and / or activation .
"although y - interferon is a likely candidate ( alone or in conjunction with other cytokines ) for induction of the in vivo eression of hla class i1 in synovial tissue , the exact mechanisms of such eression are unknown .","in addition to an immune function , the presence of hla class i1 molecules of synovial cells may be important in down - regulation of their proliferation ."
"among them , the most important are probably identification of the antigen ( s ) involved in triggering of the autoimmune process and the composition of the t cell repertoire capable of responding to the above aggression .","thus , considering the hypothesis that the disease could correlate with hyperinducibility of class i i molecules on synoviocytes , several key pieces are missing from the puzzle ."
this is remarkable for a disease which was not considered to involve the immune system less than two decades ago .,study of the hla has been highly rewarding over the last years .
progress almost parelleled the improvement in hla typing and reflected successive significant technological advances .,"the first association was described in , when the specificity of b15 was reported , followed in by the report of a b8 association ( nerup et al . , ; singal and blajchmann , ) ."
"it is feasible that , during this period , improvements in i - ila typing ( mainly identification of variants within supertypic specificities ) led to an increase in the relative risk for the disease .","thus , iddm is an exemplary case for further dissection of the polymorphism of the hla system in order to identify hla factors related to the highest susceptibilities and the molecular basis for the fine specificities of the different alleles implicated ."
"among dqw3 , at least three molecular subtypes have been found using serological , cellular , and molecular approaches ( dqw3 . 1 , dqw3 . 2 , and dqw3 . 3 , or dqw7 , dqw8 , and dqw9 , respectively ) .","a higher relative risk is associated with one of the dq / 3 subtypes ( this subtype being shared with the different dqw subtypes of the dr4 haplotypes , which were found earlier to be susceptible ) ."
"in contrast , there is no common polymorphic determinant ( or structural stretch of amino acids ) in the iddm positively associated haplotypes ( noticeably dr4 , dr3 , and dr1 ) and amino acid of dq / 3 is an alanine , a valine , or a serine .",noticed that all class i1 haplotypes which were not positively associated but neutral or negatively associated with iddm possessed in common an aspartic acid at position in the dq / 3 chain .
"for example , when an oligonucleotide probe detecting dqw3 . 2 versus dqw3 . 1 was used in conjunction with an oligonucleotide probe detecting dqw2 and dqw in a population of caucasian iddm patients , only % of these patients were heterozygous for dq / 3 asp57 ( todd et al . , ) .","dq / asp "" - negative homozygozity was thus correlated with disease in % of the patients ."
"similarly , two - dimensional page would have detected specifically the dqw2 , dqw , and dqw azh / 3 chains in the non - dr3 - non - dr4 iddm .","dqw3 . 1 and dqw3 . 2 can also be distinguished by their reactivity with the mab ta ( schreuder et al . , ) ."
"this haplotype was present in all seven drw6 iddm patients observed , while it was present in only three of drw6 controls ( most of the controls were dw18 and possess an a ~ p "" ~ - positive dq / 3 chain , dqj31 . 6 ) ( horn et al . , ; todd et al . , a ) .","the analysis of haplotypes rarely associated with iddm has been rewarding : drw6 , the dq / 3 sequence derived from drw6 ' iddm , contained a val57 of the dq fl chain , which corresponds to the drw6 - dw subgroup of drw6 individuals ."
"this is commonly found in caucasians , while in blacks the dr3 is mostly associated with a specific dqw4 p chain .","in the frequent case of dr3 association , the dqw p2 chain contains an ala57 ."
the emerging picture suggests that it is the charge of the polymorphic residue at position of dq p that is associated with iddm susceptibility .,"since associations of certain dr and dq antigens are very different among ethnic groups , one should only consider the individual dr / and dq a and p chains present ( and their sequences ) and not rely on the "" classical , "" but overestimated , linkage disequilibrium phenomenon ."
several important exceptions exist to the absence of asp57 dq / as a requirement for iddm susceptibility .,the drw9 haplotypes associated with iddm in the japanese have asp57 dq p . this is also the case for two other susceptible haplotypes found in japanese dr4 and dqw9 .
"since the dr ct chain is monomorphic , it cannot therefore contribute to the heterozygous effect .",this prompted a search for the class i1 molecule inducing the most susceptibility .
hybrid class i1 molecules provide the best model to elain the heterozygous effect observed for iddm .,the demonstration of the existence of homologous hybrid hla - dq molecules lends weight to this hypothesis ( cf .
"the data are consistent , the highest susceptibility being mediated by a conformational structure present in an hybrid molecule formed by the dqw3 . 2 ( i . e . , dqw8 ) fl chain of the dr4 haplotype and the dqw2 ( y chain of the dr3 haplotype .","some degree of degeneracy in the amino acid composition could be allowed by the model , leading to a gradient of "" susceptibility "" molecules ."
"indeed , the heterozygous effect was observed not only in dr3 - dr4 individuals , but also in dr4 - drl individuals .","this could be interpreted in that the conformation of the dq hybrid molecule formed in dr4 - dr1 is very close to that formed in dr4 - dr3 ( functionally and / or for peptide binding ) , and thus confers a similar level of susceptibility ."
"when other dq a - p combinations are present , the level of disease susceptibility appears to be lower , which may reflect less functional efficiency of the hybrid molecule created in these cases .","this was recently extended to the dq a locus , for which the same heterogeneity was found in both patients and controls , thus not allowing identification of the residue ( s ) of the dqw2 a chain , which contribute ( s ) to disease susceptibility ."
"alternatively , the heterozygous effect may not concern a dq a - p dimer , but some other type of class i1 molecules .","in this respect , it is noteworthy that in japanese iddm - susceptible haplotypes dr4 - dqw4"
in this population a characteristic dr p - dq a dimer could be equivalent to the dq p - dq a dimer found in caucasians .,"and drw9 - dqw9 , the dq p chain has asp5 ' , but that it is the dr p chains which may contribute to disease susceptibility ( i . e . , the absence of aspartic acid or the presence of serine in iddm dr / 3 chains from japanese patients ) ."
"in the iddm - prone nod mice which are i - e - , the eression of i - e ( i . e . , dr - like ) molecules prevents the development of diabetes , while the i - a / ( lea , dq - like ) chain possesses a predisposing ser5 ' residue ( nishi - mot0 et al . , ) .","while the authors suggest that protection may be due to an i - e - controlled suppression or to cross - tolerance to the self - antigen , i propose an alternative elanation ."
"the possible contribution of molecules other than dq was raised earlier , when a group reported the existence of a a polymorphism ( detected as a tuqi fragment in rflp ) associated with iddm ( festenstein et al . , ) .","however , the a gene has no known product , and several other groups did not find the a association ."
"however , the fact that the iddm - associated dr3 haplotypes and the iddm - neutral dr7 haplotypes , although having different dq a chains , display the same two opposing amino acids does not favor any particular role for the asp "" 7 dq / 3 - arg79 dq a interaction .","thus , the negatively charged n n - a ~ ~ ~ ~ in dq p is likely to form a salt bridge with the positively charged arg7g of the dq a chain ."
"in a series of iddm patients from norway , an increased risk was found among dr4 - drw8 heterozygotic individuals , similar to that seen for dr3 - dr4 heterozygotes .","by rflp and as0 typing , the dr4 - drw8 patients appear to bear the dr4 - dqw8 / drw8 - dqw4 haplotypes in eight of nine ."
the dqa - / 3 dimer composition found in drw9 - drw9 blacks with iddm is thus similar to that obtained in trans in the dr3 - dr4 heterozygous caucasians .,it should be pointed out that the dqal of the black drw9 haplotypes was found to be identical to caucasian dr9 and black dr7 and to correspond to the regular dqal of dr4 .
an unknown sequence ( s ) presumably on dq q is usually required to obtain full disease susceptibility .,in some instances this dq a factor may even overrule the causative effect of the specific dq fl sequence .
"following the thyroid model , in which the aberrant eression of class i1 molecules on the epithelial cell population was proposed as the central event leading to the autoimmune phenomenon observed in thyroiditis , a similar hypothesis was proposed for iddm ( hanafusa et al . , ; bottazo et al . , ) .",this central question has prompted many laboratories to investigate the somatic eression of hla class i1 molecules in the pancreatic endocrine tissue and its regulation and its role in the physiopathology of the disease .
"recent data from mice have shown that class i1 eression alone is not sufficient to endow complete antigen - presenting cell function of / islet cells ( markmann et al . , ) .",this casts doubt on the possibility that class i1 eression could be solely responsible for the initiation of autoimmunity .
"this may also be related to the class i1 eression of thyrocytes in culture which is observed following the introduction of simian virus dna ( belfiore et al . , ) .","it could be that islet p cells are uniquely sensitive to an as yet unknown specific combination of lymphokines or , alternatively , that a p islet cell specific virus determines the class i1 induction via a mechanism similar to that which has been reported in rats , in which a noninfective neurotropic coronavinus induces class i1 eression in astrocytes ( massa et al . , ) ."
"this was indeed the case ( lo et al . , ; sarvetnick et al . , ) .",it was anticipated that these animals would only differ from nontransgenic animals by the eression of class i1 in pancreatic islet / 3 cells .
"although several highly speculative elanations were proposed , none has yet been validated eerimentally .","this is the case for competition for transcriptional factors between the transgenic mhc and the endogenous insulin gene , interaction between the intracellular pathway of insulin secretion and mhc class i1 eression leading to degradation of the insulin or direct binding between insulin and the mhc proteins ( parham , ) ."
stimulation of interleukin synthesis and release by the b cell were also observed .,"using sepharose - conjugated anti - hla class i1 antibodies , we were able to directly activate human b cells via a secondary messenger pathway involving calcium flux , phospholipase c metabolism , and protein kinase c activation ( mooney and charron , ; mooney et al . , ) ."
fascinating questions remain to be answered in order to understand the role of the hla class i1 eression in iddm susceptibility .,"as the genetics have become more precise , the eression leading to the pathology has become more enigmatic ."
"alternatively , the demonstration that class i1 eression may alter in some way the cell biology of the pancreatic / cell would direct our thinking of pathophysiology and therapy onto different tracks .","identification of the self - peptide ( or foreign peptide ) , which binds efficiently to the class i1 molecules involved in the genetic susceptibility , will obviously be an important breakthrough in our understanding and may also provide new therapeutical approaches ."
"the strong negative association of iddm with dr2 has been a constant observation which warrants discussion ( bertrams and baur , ) .","the supertypic dr2 specificity is protective , but only in some subtypes , as the subdivision of dr2 into drw and drw correlates exactly with disease susceptibility , drw being dramatically decreased in iddm , while drw ( a rare haplotype in caucasians ) is associated with the disease ( tiwari and terasaki , ) ."
"alternatively , the nonresponder status could be an active phenomenon ( boitard et al . , ) .",suppression via t cells has been documented and found to be under mhc class i1
"several haplotypes , although possessing an asp57 , are only weakly negatively associated or neutral , and some asp5 ' - positive dq p individuals are positively associated with iddm .","for example , in the japanese drw9 , one could argue that a dq a chain could abrogate the role of the asp57 dq p . additional class i1 sequences of the dq p chain or of another chain may be required to confer full dominant suppression ."
this highest relative risk found in the heterozygous dr3 - dr7 individual suggests that possibility of a transcomplementation within the dq system .,"cd is also characterized by the heterozygous effect observed concerning dr3 and dr7 , which in considerable in some populations ( betuel et al . , ) ."
"however , this was not confirmed in a group of homozygous dr3 cd patients in which the dr p and dq p rflp patterns were identical to those found in the control group ( sacks et al . , ) .","a d q p chain cdna probe was reported to identify a polymorphic fragment which was a better marker of the cd than the dqw2 serological specificity ( howell et al . , ) ."
"alternatively , although independent in normal dq haplotypes , dp may be more strictly linked in the cd haplotypes .","moreover , since a dp a polymorphism ( 84% versus %) was also increased in the same patients , along with the dp p polymorphism , this study may indicate a role for interisotypic hybrid molecules and determinants formed by dp a and dq / and / or dpp - dqa ."
"this study was conducted using a panel of dp - specific oligonucleotide probes on polymerase chain reaction - amplified material , which allowed the detection of dp p and two dp a alleles .","two specific dp p alleles were increased in the patient population ( dpb4 . 2 and dpbs ) , conferring relative risks of and , respectively ."
"altogether , the data focus on position of the dp / 3 chain , at which both dpb4 . 2 and dpb3 share a lysine residue ( as in dpb1 ) .","when the dq polymorphism was further investigated at the dna and protein levels in white patients a - kda bglii rflp fragment was found in % of the cd patients , compared to % in the controls ."
"the constant presence in cd patients ( including a non - dr3 patient ) of a specific dqw2 a chain ( usually associated with the regular dr3 haplotype ) would not have been detected without the use of molecular probes , since the serological dqw2 specificity reflects the dqw2 / chain , and since this chain is structurally almost totally identical in dr3 , dr7 , and some dr5 and drw8 haplotypes .",the molecule of most importance in cd appears to be a dqw2 . 3 a - dqw2 / dimer .
or in trans ( the haplotype carrying the cis combination is likely to have evolved by crossing over during evolution between the two haplotypes carrying the trans combination ) .,"in dr3 - dqw2 individuals the genes which provide the dq a - p dimer are encoded on the same haplotype ( & complementation ) , while in dr ~ - dqw ~ / dr ~ - dqw ~ individuals the same dq cr - p dimer is encoded by genes on both haplotypes ( tramcomplementation ) ."
"the direct role of these cells in cd is supported by the recent observation that ia ' gut epithelial cells can function as accessory cells in allogeneic reactions and process and present soluble antigen to primed t cells in an mhc - restricted manner ( mayer and salien , ) .","it is of interest to note that while crypts and epithelium are drf in cd , only the epithelial cells appear to bear the dq ' molecule , which are also increased in the lamina propria ."
"it should be pointed out that , when the antigen is polysaccharidic , the hla class i1 immune response appears to be preferentially restricted by dq molecules ( durandy et al . , ) .","although it has been not defined chemically , the triggering antigen is likely to be a gluten - derived peptide which could associate with some specific affinity to the mhc class i1 molecule involved in cd ."
"the first suggestion , dating from the early s , that the hla system contributes to the genetic susceptibility to ms is now well established .","the association was initially found with hla - a3 and - b7 ( jersild et al . , ; compston , ; tiwari and terasaki , ) , then more closely with dr2 and , in particular , the dw2 subtype ."
"the dqwla subtype is associated with dri - dr2 "" short "" ( drw16 ) and dr - bon , while the dqwlb subtype is associated with dr2 "" long "" ( drw15 ) and some drw6 ( drwl8 ) .","fauchet used a dq p probe and four enzymes ( i . e . , bamhi , bglii , ecori , and ecorv ) to identify two rflp variants - dqw la and dqwlb - the latter corresponding to the cluster dqr2 - 6 previously defined ( cohen et al . , ) ."
"an earlier population study had provided evidence for an association of the dqr2 - 6 cluster with ms ( marcadet et al . , a ) .",this was confirmed and extended in a study of patients from a norwegian population .
"these may be related to previous work identifying that the al - b8 - dw3 haplotype was found in severe progressive ms , while the a3 - b7 - dr2 haplotype was associated with the more common milder disease ( madigand et al . , ) .",the two patients who were negative with two oligonucleotide probes were dr3 - .
"an rflp study of patients with ms from northern ireland and scotland mentions a polymorphism of the dq a gene ( dqa - msp1 5 - kb fragment ) which was found in increased frequency in dr2 ms patients ( heard et al . , ) .","since this polymorphism appears to be allelic to the dqw1 . 2 a usually found in dr2 - dw2 haplotypes , it is likely that in the cells of ms patients who are dr2 - dw2 dqw1 . 2 , the new dq a fragment is contributed by the other haplotype ."
the absence of a linkage between dpw4 and dr2 would argue that the two disease susceptibility elements have independent contributions .,"however , a determinant could be created by a dimer consisting of a dq cy and a dp / chain , both genetically linked to ms , although independent , which would represent the key element ."
the way in which the hla disease susceptibility factor participates in the mechanisms leading to the disease is still largely unknown .,we await studies of dp ( y polymorphism in ms in order to conclude this point .
the t cell response is also a critical parameter in inducing and / or controlling the disease .,"several reports mention modification of the tcr / repertoire in the ms population ( seboun et al . , ; beall et al . , ) ."
whether the tcr p anomaly is in itself a disease susceptibility gene or a gene in linkage disequilibrium with another predisposing gene is still debated .,it is also possible that other tcr genes contribute to the genetic background which interact with unknown environmental agents to create the disease .
"clearly , the hla class i1 molecules involved in disease susceptibility have a normal structure and may be found in the normal population , although at a lower frequency .","the data reviewed here support the concept that the disease susceptibility element is composed of amino acids ( contiguous and / or distantly spaced on the same chain , or on different chains of the same or a distinct class i1 isotype ) which delineate a specific three - dimensional conformation ."
"clearly , even when a portion of one class i1 chain appears to be predominant in disease susceptibility , additive and often synergistic contributions are found for a second chain .","in conjunction with the fact that hla class i1 molecules are a - p dimers capable of forming hybrid molecules ( intra - or interisotypic ) by czsand / or tram - complementation , this provides an ideal structural framework for the localization of the conformational disease susceptibility epitope ( s ) ."
many peptides ( but not all ) are likely to bind to the disease susceptibility element .,"moreover , as a peptide receptor , an mhc class i1 molecule could be flexible , allowing for some variation in the amino acid composition of the antigenic peptide ( s ) ."
candidate peptides are presently being tested for their ability to bind class i1 disease susceptibility elements .,the tcr represents the third partner of the functional trimolecular complex involved in the control of the immune response .
the eression of class i1 molecules on the thymus is set to eliminate mhc self - reactivity .,"however , this process may require specific amounts of any class i molecule and sufficient duration of eression of a particular class i1 molecule in order to efficiently result in a full depletion of autoreactive t cells ( self - mhc ) ."
"this possibility was suggested when anti - ia mab ' s were shown to prevent or reverse induced , as well as spontaneous , autoimmune diseases in animal models .",this concept permits the perspective that either blocking or competing antibodies or peptides may be tailored toward the disease susceptibility element and will therefore display high specificity and predictably high efficacy against the disease - associated immune response .
this article reports a study investigating hand and environmental contamination levels when health care workers ( hcws ) followed two different methods of removing gloves at two distances from the rubbish bin .,background : gloves are a necessary contact precaution to prevent transmission of infectious pathogens that spread by direct or indirect contact with an infected person or a contaminated environment .
"gloves are not only necessary for contact precautions , but also essential for preventing the transmission of infectious bacteria , viruses , and microorganisms that can spread by direct or indirect contact with an infected person or contaminated environment .","gloves also reduce the transmission risks posed by the presence of excessive wound drainage , fecal incontinence , or other bodily discharges ."
"however , to date no studies have examined the effects of the cdc - recommended method on the preventing contamination by comparing the contamination rates associated with the cdc ' s glove removal method and personal or causal glove removal methods ( ie , those predominately used in daily practice ) .","to minimize contamination during the removal of contaminated gloves , the focus must be on the doffing method used ."
"disposable latex gloves were used for the test , because latex is the material generally used by hong kong hospital authority ( hkha ) .","powder - free latex gloves ( saf - care plus ; careplus ( m ) sdn bhd , seremban , negeri sembilan , malaysia ) were purchased from the hkha ' s supplier ."
many studies use fluorescent stain to represent the contamination caused by pathogens .,", following zamora et al , a contamination stain larger than cm was considered a large patch , and one smaller than cm was considered a small patch ."
"the uv lamp was checked and tested before the study ; the same brand of uv lamp was used throughout the study period , to prevent any significant mismatch in the results .",all participants assessed the uv lamp before donning the gloves and protective clothing to ensure that no fluorescent solution was present .
"after glove removal , fps were counted by a uv scan under dim light .",a video demonstrating the cdc ' s recommended glove removal method was shown between two sessions .
"as shown in table , the small patches were more common than the large patches .",figure b shows hcw rankings for the small patches on the front of the gown at pretest and posttest .
"on an average , subjects removing gloves following the cdc glove removal method required seconds ( range , - 23 seconds ) , whereas those removing gloves following a personal or causal doffing required only seconds ( range , - 12 seconds ; f ; p , . 001 ) ( fig ) .","there were no significant differences in hand contamination rate between the two groups in terms of pretest and posttest , distance , and hcw ranking ."
"these findings might imply the following potential mechanisms for transmission of diseases spread by glove removal : glove removal mainly induces environmental contamination , especially on the front of removed gloves and the cover of rubbish bin , rather than hand contamination .","significantly fewer large patches were found , averaging - 0.2 patch at feet and virtually at feet ."
"as far as the results of this study are concerned , the cdc glove removal procedure is certainly essential to prevent cross - infection in daily practice .","our hospital has many posters reminding frontline hcws about hand hygiene and the sequence for removing ppe , yet none of these hcws followed the cdc glove removal procedure ."
"likewise , the placement of the rubbish bin is also an important point , given that most hcws remove their gloves in front of the bin .",we recommend not placing the rubbish bin under the sink used for hand hygiene .
it is conceivable that more trainings and practice exercises will decrease the time required for glove removal .,"although the cdc method offers superior protection against environmental contamination , it takes longer , likely due to rusty technique ."
"our findings underscore the importance of following the appropriate procedure for removing gloves and maintaining the proper distance between the hcw and the rubbish bin when discarding used gloves , as well as the need for proper training and supervision of minor staff in infection control measures .","in summary , more contamination was spread in the area between the hcw and the environment as well as on the cover of the rubbish bin when gloves were removed following a personal or causal method , and following the cdc glove removal procedure significantly decreased contamination of the environment and hcws ."
"of course , caution is recommended when interpreting these data , given the limitations of this study .","the unequal ratio of male and female subjects due to the female dominance of the nursing profession made it difficult to compare results , even though no sex - based differences were evident ."
"the authors thank k . f . leung for his helpful suggestions regarding statistical analysis , as well as their colleagues who took time out of their busy lives to participate in this study .",the project was supported and supervised by an infection control dissertation project of hong kong polytechnic university .
this review discusses the challenges in identifying the source of this fatal virus and developing effective and safe anti - mers - cov vaccines and therapeutics in order to control its spread and to combat any future pandemic .,"middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) , a novel human coronavirus that caused outbreaks of a sars - like illness in the middle east , is now considered a threat to global public health ."
"on september , dr . ali moh zaki , a virologist at dr . fakeeh hospital , jeddah , saudi arabia , first reported on the program for monitoring emerging diseases ( promedmail ) that a novel coronavirus ( ncov ) had been isolated from the lungs of a - year - old male patient with acute pneumonia and acute renal failure .","on september , the world health organization ( who ) was informed by the united kingdom ( uk ) of a - year - old male qatari national who had a travel history to saudi arabia and qatar and showed symptoms of ncov infection ."
"by june , who had been informed of confirmed cases , including deaths ( a case fatality rate of %) , from four countries in the middle east ( saudi arabia , jordan , qatar , and the united arab emirates ) , three countries in europe ( france , italy , and the united kingdom ) , and one country in africa ( tunisia ) ( table ) .","some of the patients reported in europe were originally infected during their travel in the middle east and became ill after their return to europe , while others who had not been to the middle east , but had been in close contact with laboratory - confirmed or probable cases , became infected because of limited person - to - person transmission ."
"on june , the obama administration designated mers - cov a threat to public health and national security and gave officials the authority to fast - track the approval of tests and treatments for mers - cov .","dr . kathleen sebelius , the secretary of the department of health and human services of the united states , made the designation , allowing the u . s . food and drug administration ( fda ) to quickly approve products after accepting an "" emergency use application ( eua ) "" ."
"medical authorities in saudi arabia have taken immediate steps to implement control measures over fears of a potential mers - cov pandemic resulting from this event , including the advisement to wear face masks in overcrowded areas .","in mid - october of this year , more than two million muslims will undertake the hajj , an annual pilgrimage to mecca , and they will remain in a confined geographical area over a five - day period ."
"genetically , we know that this virus is closely related to tylonycteris bat cov hku4 ( ty - batcov hku4 ) and pipistrellus bat cov hku5 ( pi - batcov hku5 ) in bats from hong kong .","however , the molecular clock analysis suggests that these bat viruses are unlikely the direct ancestor of mers - cov ."
"it was reported that some mers - cov cases , as noted above , had a history of contact with animals , such as camels and goats , suggesting that mers - cov may have jumped from bats to these animals before infecting humans .","however , its animal reservoir and intermediate hosts still have not been identified , which has significantly hindered the development of strategies to control this emerging infectious disease and combat the potential pandemic of mers ."
"however , the problems encountered in the development of sars vaccines should be revisited before the mers vaccines are designed .","to control mers , we must develop an effective and safe vaccine , which constitutes a second challenge to researchers ."
"by comparing the sequences of spike proteins of sars - cov and mers - cov , we predicted that a - amino acid fragment ( residues e662 ) in the s1 subunit of mers - cov contains its rbd .",we strongly believe that the rbd in the mers - cov spike protein is therefore an important target for developing mers vaccines .
"however , our study demonstrated that the epitopes eliciting the cross - reactive antibodies may not be located in the rbd of sars - cov s protein .","thus , it is doubtful whether these antibodies really have a role in cross - protection against mers - cov ."
"to date , no effective antiviral therapeutics against mers - cov have been discovered .","clinical management is mainly supportive , placing emphasis on organ support for respiratory and renal failure ."

"furthermore , some coughs may be caused or worsened by medications ( table - 4 ) .",the previous response or lack of response to some therapies for recurrent and chronic cough can provide important information ( see table ) .
it is essential to remember that the daily language of the physician is full of jargon that may be adopted by parents but with a different meaning from that understood by physicians .,"a history of accompanying signs or symptoms , whether localized to the respiratory tract ( wheeze , stridor ) or elsewhere ( failure to thrive , frequent malodorous stools ) can give important clues ( table - 5 ; see tables - 2 and - 3 ) ."
did the child receive a bone marrow transplant a year ago ?,did the toddler choke on a carrot or other food months ago ?
"is this diameter small , as can be seen with some restrictive lung diseases with small lung volumes ( muscular dystrophy , spinal muscular atrophy ) ?","is the anteroposterior ( ap ) diameter increased , which indicates hyperinflation of the lungs from obstruction of small airways ( asthma , bronchiolitis , cf ) ?"
any retractions other than the mild normal depressions seen between an infant ' s lower ribs indicate a greater - than - normal work of breathing .,"retractions occur most commonly with obstructed airways ( upper or lower ) , but they may occur with any condition leading to the use of the accessory muscles ."
less easy to notice than intercostal retractions is their bulging out with eiration in a child with eiratory obstruction ( asthma ) .,contraction of the abdominal muscles with eiration is easier to notice and is another indication that a child is working harder than normal to push air out through obstructed airways .
"palpation for tactile fremitus , the transmitted vibrations of the spoken word ( "" ninety - nine "" is the word often used to accentuate these vibrations ) , helps determine areas of increased parenchymal density and hence increased fremitus ( as in pneumonic consolidation ) or decreased fremitus ( as in pneumothorax or pleural effusion ) .",palpating the abdomen gently during eiration may allow the examiner to feel the contraction of the abdominal muscles in cases of eiratory obstruction .
the two - headed stethoscope enables the user to hear homologous segments of both lungs simultaneously in order to identify instances in which there is a delay in air entry or exit .,the traditional single - headed stethoscope is adequate in most children with cough .
"wheezes are continuous musical sounds ( lasting longer than milliseconds ) , caused by vibration of narrowed airway walls , as with asthma , and perhaps vibration of material within airway lumens .",these sounds are much more commonly heard during eiration than inspiration .
"although children with cough resulting from cf , mycoplasma species , tuberculosis , aspiration , a bronchial foreign body , or an anatomic abnormality usually have abnormal chest radiographs , a normal radiograph does not exclude these diagnoses .","a normal chest radiograph indicates the unlikelihood of pneumonia caused by respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) , influenza , parainfluenza , adenovirus , chlamydia species , or bacteria ."
"a wbc count of , 000 with % lymphocytes strongly suggests pertussis , but not every child with pertussis presents such a clear hematologic picture .","the white blood cell ( wbc ) count may help exclude or include certain entities for a differential diagnosis , but , with the possible exception of pertussis , can seldom establish a diagnosis with certainty ."
"if pleural fluid or fluid obtained directly from the lung via needle aspiration is cultured , the same rules apply : positive cultures are definitive , but negative cultures are not .",bacterial antigen detection in serum or urine by various techniques ( latex agglutination ) can help identify pneumococcus and haemophilus influenzae type b .
"finally , multiple tests can be employed to confirm the diagnosis of cf ( table - 8 ) .","several imaging techniques , such as ct or magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , can help to delineate various intrathoracic anatomic abnormalities ."
the age of the patient has a large impact on the type of infection .,infections are the most common cause of acute cough in all age groups and are responsible for some chronic coughs .
viral illness may predispose to bacterial superinfection ( croup and staphylococcus aureus tracheitis or influenza and h . influenzae pneumonia ) .,"viral upper respiratory infections ( common cold ) ; croup ( laryngotracheobronchitis ) ; viral bronchiolitis , particularly with rsv ; and viral pneumonia are the most frequently encountered respiratory tract infections and hence the most common causes of cough in infancy ."
"it is important to distinguish croup from epiglottitis in the child with harsh , barking cough and inspiratory stridor because the natural histories of the two diseases are quite different ( see table ) .",epiglottitis occurs more commonly in toddlers than in infants ( see chapter ) .
"a single dose of dexamethasone ( 0.6 mg / kg orally , intramuscularly , or intravenously ) reduces the severity and hastens recovery .",a child who responds favorably to such an aerosol needs to be observed for several hours because further treatment may be needed .
"the chest is hyperinflated , widespread crackles are audible on inspiration , and wheezing marks eiration .","the most striking laboratory abnormalities are in the chest radiograph , which invariably reveals hyperinflation , as depicted by a depressed diaphragm , with an enlarged retrosternal air space in as many as % of patients , peribronchial thickening in approximately %, and consolidation and / or atelectasis in % to %."
the effect of aerosolized bronchodilators is not clear but is probably beneficial in some infants .,"in these cases , hospital care with supplemental oxygen and intravenous fluids is indicated ."
"in young infants , the afebrile pneumonia syndrome may be caused by chlamydia , ureaplasma , or mycoplasma species ; cytomegalovirus ; or pneumocystis carinii .",mechanical ventilation may be necessary in a small minority of infants .
"the causative organism , bordetella pertussis , has a tropism for tracheal and bronchial ciliated epithelial cells ; thus , the disease is primarily bronchitis , but spread of the organism to alveoli , or secondary invasion by other bacteria , can cause pneumonia .",pertussis is an extremely important cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and children .
"most children are entirely well between coughing spells , when physical findings are remarkably benign .","infants younger than months of age may have the most severe illness , and in this age group , the rate of mortality from pertussis is as high as %."
"treatment with erythromycin estolate ( 50 mg / kg / day for days , every hours , orally ) decreases infectivity and may ameliorate the course of the disease if given during the catarrhal stage .","treatment is largely supportive , with oxygen , fluids , and small frequent feedings for patients who do not tolerate their normal feedings ."
ureaplasma urealyticum pneumonia is difficult to diagnose but causes cough in some infants .,there are no particularly outstanding features to distinguish this relatively uncommon infection from viral pneumonias .
the remarks concerning colds and cough in infants ( see previous discussion ) apply to this older age group .,such children may have as many as to or even more colds in a year .
"in the first two situations , it may not matter because treatment is the same .","in the case of the child with asthma , it is important to treat the asthma with bronchodilating and antiinflammatory agents , as well as to treat the infected sinuses with antibiotics ."
"cough may not be as prominent a presenting symptom or sign as tachypnea and grunting , sometimes ( especially in infants ) with vomiting ( see table ) .","raised respiratory rates ( in infants to months old , in children to years old ) plus retractions and grunting with or without hypoxia ( oxygen saturation < 90% ) have a high specificity and sensitivity for pneumonia ."
"in older children , there may be localized dullness to percussion , with crackles or amphoric ( bronchial ) breath sounds over a consolidated lobe .","the chest film may be normal in the first hours of the illness , inasmuch as the radiographic findings often lag behind the clinical manifestations ."
children ( especially infants ) with staphylococcal pneumonia are more likely to have a rapid overwhelming course .,some clinical and radiographic features may be suggestive of the bacterial cause of pneumonia .
the presence of bacterial antigens in the urine for s . pneumoniae or h . influenzae provides strong evidence of the causative agent .,current or previous antibiotic treatment diminishes the yield of such cultures .
"many children with pneumonia do well with oral antibiotics ( amoxicillin , amoxicillin - clavulanate , oral cephalosporins ) and respond within hours to the first dose .","for the critically ill child , vancomycin may be considered for possible resistant s . pneumoniae ."
"the illness typically begins with table ); atypical in terms of extrapulmonary manifestations , low - grade fever , patchy diffuse infiltrates , poor response to penicillin - type antibiotics , and negative sputum gram stain .",the disease often occurs in community outbreaks in the fall months .
"extrapulmonary symptoms ( i . e . , sore throat , myalgias , headache , fever ) , which then progress to include worsening cough , paroxysmal at times .","patients do not often appear acutely ill , but cough may persist for weeks ."
"the diagnosis is often made from the history of an older child who has a lingering coughing illness in the setting of a community outbreak , unresponsive to most ( non - erythromycin ) antibiotic regimens .","the more severe the illness is , the greater is the frequency of positive cold agglutinins ."
"extrapulmonary complications of mycoplasmal infection include aseptic meningitis , transverse myelitis , peripheral neuropathy , erythema multiforme , myocarditis , pericarditis , hemolytic anemia , and bullous otitis media ( myringitis ) .","in patients with sickle cell anemia , severe respiratory failure and acute chest syndrome may develop ."
"tuberculosis must be considered in the child with chest disease that is not easily elained by other diagnoses , especially if the child has been eed to an adult with active tuberculosis .","the incidence of tuberculosis is increasing as a result of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome , homelessness , urban poverty , and immigration from endemic countries ."
"the diagnosis is made primarily by skin testing ( purified protein derivative [ ppd ] ); a history of contact with a person who has tuberculosis ; and recovery of the organism from sputum , bronchoalveolar lavage , pleural fluid or biopsy , or morning gastric aspirates ( table - 14 ) .","the yield from these procedures is relatively low , even from children with active pulmonary tuberculosis ."
"cavitary and endobronchial lymph node involvement are highly infectious , in contrast to the much less contagious nature of the hypersensitivity reaction noted in primary pulmonary disease .",reactivation of upper lobe pulmonary disease may produce cavities that are similar to the disease among adults .
interference with normal swallowing disrupts the coordination of swallowing and breathing that prevents aspiration .,"inhaling food , mouth or gastric secretions , or foreign bodies into the tracheobronchial tree causes acute , recurrent , or chronic cough ."
"because most patients aspirate sporadically , a normal barium swallow does not rule out aspiration .",barium contrast studies during swallowing may help characterize these disorders if barium enters the trachea .
"toddlers , who by nature put all types of things into their mouths and who have incompletely matured swallowing and airway protective mechanisms , are at high risk .",any child with cough of abrupt onset should be suspected of having inhaled a foreign body into the airway .
aspiration is usually unilateral ( 80% ); % to % of the objects are in the right lung ( the lobe depends on body position - supine versus standing - but is often the right middle lobe ) .,"in a few patients , it may be possible to identify the foreign body itself ; nonetheless , most inhaled food particles are not radiopaque and cannot be seen on radiographs ."
whether acid in the esophagus is sufficient stimulus to cause bronchoconstriction by itself or whether it merely heightens bronchial reactivity to other stimuli is not yet clear ( see chapter ) .,many children with reactive airways disease have cough or wheeze that is difficult to control until their concurrent ger is also treated .
"the child who coughs after meals or at night , when the supine position may provoke ger , should be evaluated for ger .",the diagnosis of gerd must also be considered in the child with chronic or recurrent cough with no other obvious elanation .
"theophylline may worsen ger by lowering the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter , and some drugs that increase lower esophageal sphincter tone may cause bronchoconstriction .",treatment in a child whose cough is related to ger may be accomplished by treating the reflux ( see chapter ) or by a combination of antireflux and antiasthma treatment ( see chapter ) .
some of the features that characterize the cough of a child with asthma are listed in table .,"in fact , reactive airway disease or asthma ( see chapter ) is almost certainly the most common cause of recurrent and chronic cough in childhood ."
"with current state - of - the - art care , median length of survival is to age .","early diagnosis improves the poor prognosis for untreated cf ; if untreated , many patients die in infancy or early childhood ."
"most elain the long - observed clinical manifestations of the disease , including thick , viscid mucus in the tracheobronchial tree , leading to purulent bronchiolitis and bronchitis with subsequent bronchiectasis , pulmonary fibrosis , and respiratory failure ; pancreatic duct obstruction , leading to pancreatic insufficiency with steatorrhea and failure to thrive ; and abnormally high sweat chloride and sodium concentrations .",not all the consequences of the defective gene and protein have been determined .
"cf may manifest at birth with meconium ileus ( 10% to % of patients ) or later , with steatorrhea and failure to thrive despite a voracious appetite , in an apparent effort to make up for the calories that are lost in the stool ( see chapter ) .","the most common presenting symptom is cough , which may appear within the first weeks of life or may be delayed for decades ."
false - negative results of sweat tests can be seen in cf children presenting with edema or hypoproteinemia and in samples from children with an inadequate sweat rate .,"sweat testing can be performed at any age ; newborns within the first few weeks of life may not produce a large enough volume of sweat to analyze ( 75 mg minimum ) , but in those who do ( the majority ) , the results are accurate ."
several studies have shown survival to be significantly better in center - based care than in non - center - based care .,"the treatment of patients with cf requires a comprehensive approach , best performed in , or in conjunction with , an approved cf center ."
this is just as true for the appearance of a mild morning cough in the child who was previously cough free as it is for severe coughing spells that keep a child awake through the night .,"because active infection and inflammation lead to irreversible lung damage , such changes need to be taken seriously and treated aggressively ."
the frequency with which any of these physical means of eelling mucus should be used varies but should be increased with signs of active infection and obstruction .,"variations on the physical maneuvers to help with mucus clearance include forced eiratory technique , positive airway pressure face masks , and masks with eiratory flutter valves ."
"long available as a diuretic , amiloride can bring about a partial correction of the membrane transport defects in cf .",amiloride aerosols seem to decrease sputum viscosity and increase cough clearance .
the approach to endobronchial infection in children with cf includes prevention and treatment .,"prevention involves immunizing patients with cf against preventable respiratory pathogens , particularly influenza , measles , and pertussis ."
"a - year study of alternate - day prednisone showed improved pulmonary function but unacceptable side effects ( e . g . , glucose intolerance , growth failure ) in those taking mg / kg / day and similar side effects ( although less severe ) in those taking mg / kg / day .",the beneficial role of oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents has been demonstrated ; the role of inhaled topical steroids and - antitrypsin is being investigated .
the patient may also have difficulty swallowing if the esophagus is compressed .,"vascular rings and slings are often associated with inspiratory stridor because the abnormal vessels compress central airways , most commonly the trachea ( see chapter ) ."
"the diagnosis may be suspected from plain films of the chest , especially those showing tracheal deviation and a right - sided aortic arch .","further support for the diagnosis can be found at bronchoscopy ( which shows extrinsic compression of the trachea or a mainstem bronchus ) , barium swallow study ( which shows esophageal compression ) , or both ."
"the child may have only the diagnosis is not challenging in the infant with esophageal atresia ; a nasogastric tube cannot be passed , and swallowed barium outlines the trachea .",the h - type fistula causes more subtle signs and may be undiagnosed for months or even years .
"the infections result from several causes , including ger , with or without aspiration , and altered mucociliary transport .",treatment involves regular chest physical therapy and early and aggressive use of antibiotics whenever there is evidence of increased pulmonary symptoms .
"in rare cases , with very large airway hemangiomas , there may even be dysphagia from extrinsic compression .","hemangiomas may be present within the airway and can cause cough , rarely with hemoptysis ; stridor ( if the hemangioma is high in the airway ) and respiratory distress ( if the hemangioma is large ) may also occur ."
"however , if they cause symptoms , it may not be advisable or possible to wait for them to resolve .","as with cutaneous hemangiomas , these lesions may resolve spontaneously over the first year or so ."
"it seems that this type of cough , often termed "" psychogenic , "" or "" psychogenic cough tic , "" but perhaps more accurately and humanely thought of as habit cough , has given the child valuable attention .","this attention then serves as the sustaining force , and the cough persists beyond the original airway inflammation ."
"because this may occur in any child , evidence of mild reactive airways disease ( history or pulmonary function testing ) does not rule out the diagnosis .","once a physician has seen a child with this problem , it is usually possible to make the diagnosis with certainty on entering the examining room or , indeed , from the hallway outside the room ."
"a bed sheet is wrapped tightly and uncomfortably around the chest "" to serve as added support for the muscles [ and ] with this support , the muscles would then be able to suppress [ the ] cough . ""","one approach is "" the bed sheet , "" in which the child is told that he or she coughs because of weak chest muscles ."
postnasal drip is thought to be a major cause of cough in adults .,"the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear , and most pulmonologists believe that this must remain a diagnosis of exclusion for elaining cough in children ."
"treatment of bronchiectasis consists of chest physiotherapy and postural drainage , occasionally bronchodilators and mucolytic agents , and antibiotic therapy during exacerbations .",surgical resection may be indicated in cases that are progressive and localized when medical therapy has failed .
"treatment is similar to that for cf , with regular chest physical therapy and frequent and aggressive use of antibiotics at the first sign of airways infection , most commonly increased cough .","conditions in which the cilia do not function properly ( dysmotile cilia or ciliary dyskinesia ) lead to cough , usually because infection ( and bronchiectasis ) occurs in the absence of normal mucociliary transport ."
"some affected children seem to respond to corticosteroids or cytotoxic drugs ( e . g . , azathioprine , cyclophosphamide , and chlorambucil ) , but the episodic nature of the disease , with some clear cases of spontaneous resolution , makes it difficult to evaluate therapies .","milk products should be eliminated from the patient ' s diet , and underlying collagen vascular disease should be treated ."
"treatment depends on the cell type , but it usually involves at least some surgical removal .","the diagnosis is usually made from bronchoscopy , chest ct , or both ."
this entity is termed spasmodic croup and is of unclear origin .,"some children , usually preschoolers , may episodically awaken at night with stridor and a harsh , barking cough indistinguishable from that of viral croup ."
"not all chest films show overinflated lungs , and not all pulmonary function tests show decreased small airways function .","the diagnosis is suggested by the pulmonary function or radiographic evidence of small airways obstruction ; however , these findings are not always present ."
"none of these is foolproof , partly because blood that has originated in one of these sites might well end in another before being eelled from the body ; for instance , blood from the nose can be swallowed and vomited or aspirated and coughed out .",table gives some guidelines to help localize sites of origin of blood that has been reported or suspected as hemoptysis .
"pulmonary embolus is uncommon in children and adolescents , but it needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of an adolescent with hemoptysis of unclear origin .","clues to the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus include a positive family history , severe dyspnea , chest pain , hypoxia , a normal chest film , an accentuated second heart sound , an abnormal compression ultrasonographic study of the leg veins , a positive homans sign , a positive helical ct scan , and a high - probability lung ventilation - perfusion scan ."
"in many instances , bronchoscopy does not help except by excluding some possibilities , because either no blood or blood throughout the tracheobronchial tree is found .",bronchial artery angiography may help to identify the involved vessel or vessels .
disadvantages include narcotic addiction and loss of the protective cough reflex with subsequent mucus retention and possible superinfection .,"demulcent preparations ( sugar - containing , bland soothing agents ) temporarily suppress the cough response from pharyngeal sources , and decongestant - antihistamine combinations may reduce postnasal drip and thus cough in adults ."
community - acquired pneumonia ( cap ) is one of the major infectious disease - related causes of death in both developed and underdeveloped countries .,cap initiates with an inflammatory response elicited by resident alveolar macrophages in response to invading microorganisms .
"during the inflammatory response , neutrophils undergo sequential release of various granule subtypes and enhance respiratory burst activity with production of reactive oxygen species , with the potential to rafael fernandez - botran and silvia .","in hospitalized cap patients , severity of disease is influenced by the ability of the host s immune response to control the pathogenic microorganism , as well as through regulation of the local pro - inflammatory response and neutrophil accumulation ."
data examining the association between local the inflammatory response and severity of disease are limited .,"evidence suggests that failure to control excessive inflammation and / or neutrophil activation may result in exaggerated systemic inflammation and organ damage , leading to severe disease ."
the inclusion and exclusion criteria and full case report forms for this study can be found at the community acquired pneumonia organization study site at .,"patients with cap , defined as evidence of a new pulmonary infiltrate at chest radiograph associated with at least one of the following : new or increased cough ; fever or hypothermia ; and leukocytosis , left shift , or leucopenia , were included in this study following previous written consent ."
hospitalized patients were considered to have severe cap if their psi was risk class ivor v ( 91 points or higher ) .,"as one of the most commonly used predictive scores , the psi was used in this study to define cap severity ."
"sputum samples were collected from a total of cap patients ( 7 with non - severe , with severe cap ) on the day of admission to the hospital .",patients were instructed to rinse their mouth with water and collect any spontaneously - produced sputum into a - ml sterile disposable polypropylene centrifuge tube .
"for eight out of the ten cytokines measured ( il - 1 , il - 1 ra , il - 6 , il - 1 2 p40 , il - 17 , ifn , tnf , and cxcl8 ) , there was little if any interference , with measurements in the presence of dtt being , on average , within % of controls .","in the case of il - 10 and cxcl10 , measurements in the presence of dtt showed average reductions of - 60 % compared to controls ."
"briefly , neutrophils ( 2 cells / ml ) were incubated with , 7 - dichlorofluorescein diacetate ( 0.5 m final concentration ) for min at c .","phagocytosis and phagocytosis - stimulated respiratory burst activity were measured using a flow cytometric assay based on the production of h o stimulated by the phagocytosis of staphylococcus aureus , as previously described ."
data distribution was analyzed using the d agostino and pearson omnibus normality test .,statistical comparisons between the groups were performed using the mann - whitney test .
no differences in gender or residence at a nursing home were observed .,"cerebrovascular disease , congestive heart failure , and copd were more frequent in the severe cap group , but there were no significant differences with other underlying conditions ."
"comparison between the non - severe and severe cap groups showed a moderate but statistically - significant higher median basal level of cd66b , with no differences in fmlf - stimulated eression in severe cap patients .","table shows that the basal and fmlf - stimulated eression of both granule markers cd35 and cd66b , as well as respiratory burst activity , were higher in the cap groups ( both non - severe and severe ) compared to healthy donors , indicating that their neutrophils were primed / pre - activated in the cap patients ."
"this study indicates that , at the time of hospital admission , patients with severe cap have a decreased local inflammatory response and an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response when compared to patients with non - severe cap .",this observation suggests that patients with severe cap may have a lower and suboptimal lung inflammatory response resulting in an inability to control the microbial invasion at the local level .
"although it was eected that the higher systemic levels of pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines would correlate with more severe pneumonia , we found that hospitalized patients with non - severe cap had significantly higher levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines ( il - 1 , il - 6 , and tnf ) and il - 17 in the sputum .","in our analysis of the plasma cytokine response , we found that the patients with severe cap presented with significantly higher levels of both pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines , arguing against a potential skewing of the systemic response towards anti - inflammatory or immunosuppressive cytokines ."
"nevertheless , the positive and statistically significant correlation found between neutrophil respiratory burst activity and the systemic levels of cxcl10 is interesting .",the causes for the reduced respiratory burst in hospitalized patients with severe cap are not clear .
"our study is in line with previous reports of positive associations between higher serum pro - inflammatory and anti - inflammatory cytokine levels with measures of pneumonia severity , such as the pneumonia severity index , crb , or crb - 65 scores [ 7 , .","however , our findings of higher pro - inflammatory cytokine levels in the sputum of non - severe vs . severe cap patients have not been , to our knowledge , previously reported ."
another potential limitation of our study was the inclusion of cap patients with different microbial etiologies .,"our study had relatively few numbers of patients and sputum samples , which limits the ability of our study to generalize , and prevented adjustment for confounding effects ."
"a recent meta - analysis indicates that some of the most commonly - used scores such as psi and curb - 65 , previously derived and validated to predict day mortality , have only moderate performance to predict icu admission .","moreover , it needs to be remarked that several factors influencing the psi score may have direct effects on the inflammatory / immune response and , thus , be partially responsible for the observed results ."
"the presence of co - morbidities such as congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular diseases , and copd , which are characterized by the presence of chronic inflammatory responses , neoplasia , and therapeutic corticosteroid use , may result not only in several defects in the function of immune cells , but also in the activation of several immunoregulatory mechanisms , including immunosuppressive cytokines and myeloid and lymphocytic regulatory cells .",another limitation to our study is the inclusion of patients with conditions potentially affecting their immunocompetence status .
"if a first response at the local pulmonary level is not sufficient due to some local level of immune deficiency , then a second response at a systemic level is elicited as the last attempt to control the infection .","it can be hypothesized that , patients who are able to produce an adequate local pulmonary response are able to contain the microorganisms , do not develop an exaggerated systemic response , and present with a non - severe cap ."
"since its emergence as a clinical entity in the late s , prrs virus has proven to be a persistent threat to the health and productivity of pig herds and the economic well - being of pig producers .","initially described in the late s , porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome ( prrs ) is characterized by reproductive failure in sows , poor growth performance in growing pigs , and respiratory disease in pigs of all ages ( zimmerman et al . , ) ."
the current study allows for calculating the dose of uv required to inactivate airborne prrs virus under various laboratory and field conditions using the inactivation constants and uv half - life doses reported therein .,"prrs virus was more susceptible to ultraviolet as temperature decreased ; most susceptible to ultraviolet inactivation at relative humidity between % and %, less susceptible at relative humidity %, and least susceptible at ! 80% relative humidity ."
protection of pig barns from airborne spread of infectious agents is a recent concept .,"to date , researchers have primarily focused on preventing the introduction of airborne prrs virus into barns using commercially available air filters , e . g . , high - efficiency particulate air ( hepa ) filters , minimum efficiency rating value ( merv ) filters of various efficiencies , and fiberglass pre - filters ."
the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of temperature and relative humidity on the inactivation of airborne prrs virus by ultraviolet irradiation ( uv ) .,aerosols of prrs virus were eed to four levels of uv under nine defined conditions of temperature and relative humidity ( table ) .
the virus suspension was maintained on ice and shielded from light until nebulization .,"the solution was aerosolized using a - jet collison nebulizer ( bgi inc . , cn60 , waltham , ma , usa ) operating on compressed air at 5 kg / cm ( 22 psi ) ."
air was drawn from reservoir one into reservoir two ( 13 l ; aerosol residence time $16 s ) .,"reservoir one was housed in a chamber capable of maintaining temperatures between c and room temperature ( carroll coolers inc . , carroll , ia ) ."
"for each replicate , the actual temperature and relative humidity of the aerosol was measured ( vaisala , hmi41 indicator and hmp46 temperature probe , helsinki , finland ) inside a manifold located within reservoir two and immediately upstream of the uv eure field .","temperature and relative humidity measurements were taken prior to starting the replicate and then at the beginning , midpoint and end of each replicate to confirm that the system operated at targeted parameters ."
"lamps were mounted in three - lamp , reflective , surfacemounted , v , fixtures ( american uv company ) .","to avoid fluctuation in uv intensity , lamps were operated at their maximum uv emission capacity for min before the start of each eeriment ."
quartz tubing was evaluated for cleanliness and uv absorbance prior to each replicate by measuring uv intensity beneath and beside the tubing with the impingers in operation ( mock aerosol ) .,"between each replicate , quartz tubes were cleaned with commercial quartz cleaner following the manufacturer ' s recommendations ( hellmanex ii , hellma gmbh & co . , m lheim , germany ) ."
"vacuum pressure was maintained using oil - less pumps ( fisher scientific , s413801 , hampton , nh ) .",all connections were sealed and checked for leakage prior to each replicate .
"plates were incubated at c in a humidified % co incubator for h , after which the cells were fixed with aqueous % acetone solution and stained with a fluorescein isothiocyanate - conjugated monoclonal antibody specific for prrs virus ( sdow17 , rural technologies inc . , brookings , sd , usa ) .","thereafter , plates were incubated at c in a humidified % co incubator for h , after which the inoculum was discarded and ml per well of dmem supplemented with % fbs was added ."
"inactivation constants ( k ) , defined as the absolute value of the slope describing the linear relationship between the survival fraction of the microbial population and the uv eure dose ( goldberg et al . , ) , were estimated using the random coefficient model .",the associated uv half - life ( t / 2 ) dose for each combination of environmental factors was determined as ( log / k ) and eressed as uv mj per unit volume .
"comparisons among the three temperature groups detected a significant difference in the uv inactivation constant for prrs virus at low vs . high temperatures ( p = 167 ) , but not between low vs . medium ( p = 044 ) or medium vs . high temperatures ( p = 635 ) .","comparisons among the three levels of relative humidity revealed a statistically significant difference in inactivation constants between medium vs . high relative humidity ( p = 060 ) , but not between and low vs . medium ( p = 700 ) or low vs . high relative humidity ( p = 291 ) ."
"the effects of temperature and relative humidity on the uv inactivation of prrs virus were statistically significant , but the interaction of temperature and relative humidity was not .","ultraviolet inactivation constants decreased in a linear fashion as temperature increased , with statistically significant differences in inactivation constants detected in low vs . high temperatures , but not between low vs . medium or medium vs . high temperatures ."
"in agreement with the results of this study , tseng and li reported that uv inactivation of four bacteriophages ( ms2 , phi x174 , phi , t7 ) decreased as relative humidity increased at temperatures of c to c and speculated that decreased uv susceptibility under higher relative humidity conditions resulted from attenuation of uv by water sorption onto the viral surface .","in contrast , in a study involving bacteriophage ms2 , respiratory adenovirus serotype , and mouse hepatitis virus ( coronavirus ) , walker and ko reported that uv inactivation increased as relative humidity increased ( temperature conditions not reported ) ."
"since inactivation constants vary by temperature and relative humidity , a conservative estimate of the necessary uv dose can be made using the smallest inactivation constant ( k = 9 , table ) and its associated uv half - life dose .","the percent of the infectious viral population remaining after n uv halflife doses may be described as ( 1 / 2 n ); thus , the percent of infectious prrs virus remaining after uv doses may be calculated as ( 1 / 2 ) = %."
"methods we eressed the complete sars coronavirus envelope spike ( s ) protein from a recombinant attenuated parainfluenza virus ( bhpiv3 ) that is being developed as a live attenuated , intranasal paediatric vaccine against human parainfluenza virus type ( hpiv3 ) .","we immunised eight african green monkeys , four with a single dose of bhpiv3 / sars - s and four with a control , bhpiv3 / ctrl , administered via the respiratory tract ."
sars infection of human beings has since been contained through infection - control measures .,the causative agent was quickly identified as a previously unknown member of the coronaviridae family .
"each sample involved four wells per dilution in a well plate , and viral cytopathic effect was read on day and day and eressed as a % endpoint .","serum antibodies specific to sars coronavirus were quantified in vero cells by testing dilutions for the ability to neutralise tcid units of sars coronavirus per well , in parallel with known positive and negative control standards ."
we detected s protein with serum samples from mice infected with sars coronavirus and a second antibody of alkaline - phosphatase - conjugated goat anti - mouse igg ( invitrogen ) .,"western blot analysis was done with nupage protein electrophoresis system and westernbreeze immunodetection kit ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) ."
"through each nostril , we administered additionally , immunisation of eerimental animals with the s protein of other coronaviruses induced virus - specific immunity and , in some cases , conferred protection against subsequent challenge .","animals were first anaesthetised with ketamine hydrochloride given intramuscularly at a dose of mg / kg , and then placed in dorsal recumbency ."
analysis of the nasal swab samples taken after immunisation showed that the peak titre ( 3 vs log tcid / ml ) and duration of shedding ( 5 vs days ) from the upper respiratory tract did not differ significantly between bhpiv3 / sars - s and bhpiv3 / ctrl .,"analysis of the tracheal lavage samples , a measure of shedding from the lower respiratory tract , showed that two of the four animals infected with bhpiv3 / sars - s did not have detectable virus shedding , whereas the other two showed some shedding at days but this was less than for the bhpiv3 / ctrl - immunised animals ( table ) ."
the measurement of infectious challenge virus in secretions or other samples from eerimental animals is a general standard for measuring the efficacy of viral vaccines .,"the assessment of an eerimental vaccine in a non - human primate is especially important in view of the phylogenetic and anatomical similarity to humans , and is an appropriate last step before clinical trials ."
"however , any replicating viral vector bearing the protective antigens of a common human pathogen , such as adenovirus or hpiv3 , is unlikely to replicate sufficiently well in adults to be immunogenic because of a prevalence of neutralising antibodies to such pathogens .",", fortunately , parainfluenza viruses have been amenable to swapping of the surface proteins without loss of infectivity in vitro or in vivo ."
"it has been said that you can learn for your entire life from mistakes you make in your first year , or you can make first year mistakes for your entire life .","for me , these cases are illustrations in a long course on therapeutic humility ."
the results reveal that the ' lift - up ' core height is the most influential parameter and governs the area and magnitude of high and low wind speed zones around such buildings .,"based on wind tunnel test results and a selected comfort criterion , appropriate core dimensions could be selected to have acceptable wind conditions near lift - up buildings ."
"in addition , certain building forms have proved useful in achieving acceptable wind conditions at the pedestrian level around buildings .","for example , the aerodynamic forces and wind excitations of tall buildings may be effectively minimised by tapered shapes and chamfered corners ."
"moreover , mean wind speeds smaller than m s , the minimum mean wind speed required by the air ventilation assessment stipulated in hong kong , can cause outdoor thermal discomfort for pedestrians , especially in the hot summer months .",widespread stagnant air can be favourable to the spread of air - borne pathogens such the sars virus ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) and hence is a threat to the public health .
the ' lift - up ' building design is a potential solution for enhancing urban air ventilation in the city .,"the main structure of a ' lift - up ' building is elevated from the ground by individually , or a combination of , columns , shear walls , and a central core ( fig ."
"section discusses the results of the wind tunnel tests in three subsections ; the overall wind environment near the ' lift - up ' building models , the characteristics of the high and low wind speed zones around the ' lift - up ' building models , and the distribution of wind speeds in ' lift - up ' areas .",concluding remarks are presented in section in the form of a number of guidelines for designing ' lift - up ' buildings in a modern city .
it is noted that the building models are different in terms of the dimensions of the core .,"more specifically , height ( h ) , width ( w ) and depth ( d ) of the central core vary among the buildings while the total height ( h ) , width ( w ) , and depth ( d ) of buildings remain constant ."
the mean wind speed ( u ) at the mm height was calculated from the irwin sensors ' raw measurements according to the method proposed by ref .,"the protruding tube is to measure the wind speeds at the mm height , which is equal to m measurement height in the full scale ."
"in the present study , a and b were estimated to be 5 and 2 , respectively .","in equation , ffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi dp p is the square root of the pressure difference between two holes on the irwin sensor , and a and b are constants , which are determined from the curve fitting of mean wind speeds ( u ) measured by a hot - wire anemometer and ffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi dp p values ."
the advantages of the use of k value are its ability to eliminate the differences in wind speeds and turbulence intensities of incoming wind flows and only highlight the modifications occurred in the local wind environment near buildings .,"moreover , by knowing the k values , designers can calculate corresponding wind speeds by using local meteorological wind speed data at a given location ."
"in figures , the red arrow on the upstream side of buildings points in the direction of the approaching wind .",the cubic interpolation method was used to plot the contours of k and all the distances were normalized with respect to the building depth ( d ) .
"compared to the ' lift - up ' core height , the core area has some distinct influences on the lws zones both in the upstream and downstream directions of the buildings including the formation of bigger dnlws zones with smaller k values by larger core areas .","as it can be seen in model m1 , the shorter core ( h m ) creates an attached ulws zone , but in model m3 , which has a taller core ( h m ) , produced a ulws zone that is detached from the building ."
"therefore , the rest of the discussion focuses on examining the variations of the hws and lws zones with the ' lift - up ' core dimensions .",the differences in the pedestrian - level wind field around buildings with and without ' lift - up ' designs are a result of the formation of hws and lws zones and their variations in size and magnitude with the ' lift - up ' core dimensions .
"shows the calculated k hws values corresponding to the with larger areas , marginally reduces the k hws values .","therefore , an appropriate combination of core height and size would maximise the accelerated wind flows near ' lift - up ' buildings as observed in model m6 ."
shows the variation of ap cum with the corresponding k values for different building models .,the variation of ap cum corresponding to the control building ( cb ) is also included in fig .
"similar to the hws zones , the influence of the ' lift - up ' core dimensions on the low wind speed ( lws ) zones is quantified using the area averaged low wind speed ratio ( k lws ) as defined in equation .","for the calculation , only areas with k values lower than ( k < ) are considered as lws zones ."
"for example , shorter cores with smaller core areas create larger high wind speed zones , which cover a major portion of the ' lift - up ' area .",shows the distribution of k values in the ' lift - up ' areas of the ' lift - up ' building models to reveal the influence of the ' lift - up ' core dimensions on the pedestrian - level wind field in the ' lift - up ' area .
"the investigation used mean wind speeds measured at the mm height ( i . e . , m height in full scale ) , and the normalized mean wind speed ratio ( k ) to analyse : the overall features of the pedestrian - level wind environment around the ' lift - up ' buildings , the distribution of high and low wind speeds near the ' lift - up ' buildings , and the distribution of wind speeds in the ' lift - up ' area .",the influence of the ' lift - up ' core dimensions was determined by testing ' lift - up ' buildings with different ' liftup ' core heights and core areas .
all of these modifications are the direct results of the wind flow that passes through the ' lift - up ' area .,"the flow modifications include increases in area and magnitude of high wind speed ( hws ) zones , the formation of a pronounced low wind speed ( lws ) zone on the leeward side of the ' liftup ' building , and a weakened lws zone in the upstream direction of the ' lift - up ' building ."
the area averaged low wind speed ratio ( the k lws value ) of the two low wind speed ( lws ) zones around ' lift - up ' buildings are smaller than the k hws value of a building ' lift - up ' design .,"moreover , the core area has a greater influence on generating smaller wind speeds in the upstream low wind speed ( ulws ) zones than the ' lift - up ' core height ."
"however , if persons with influenzalike symptoms and their household contacts were encouraged to stay home , then rates of illness and death might be reduced by %.",our findings suggest that school closings would not have a substantial effect on pandemic - related outcomes in the absence of measures to reduce out - of - school contacts .

"when this intervention was implemented , a given fraction of households were assumed to comply .","if a household complied , then all of its members followed the confinement rules unless they had been previously ill and had recovered ."
"when a person was confined on a weekday ( because of his or her illness or illness of another household member ) and did not withdraw due to severe symptoms , then the duration of contacts with household members who continued to go to school or work did not change .",durations of contacts with household members who stayed at home and were not withdrawn were the same as on a weekend day .
"when ill persons and other household members were confined , a person returned to school or to work day after his or her illness ended ( even if other ill persons remained in the household ) .",a person who did not become ill returned to school or work on the third day after the last day of illness of any household member ( because the length of the latent / incubation period was assumed to be days ) .
the effectiveness of each intervention was defined as follows : effectiveness = [ ( baseline rate ) - ( rate with intervention ) ] / baseline rate,"for each intervention , we ran a set of simulations and used the aver - ages of these simulations as estimates of the eected rates under this intervention ."
"in common with all simulation studies , our findings depended on several parameters for which we have estimated values that we believe are reasonable starting points .","these values included baseline contact rates , the probability of illness given infection , the relative infectiousness of an infected person without influenza symptoms , the probability of withdrawal to home because of severe symptoms , and the reduction in contact rates due to severe symptoms ."
"based on the simulations conducted with the baseline values of the pandemic parameters , the baseline rate of illness was %, ( 95% confidence interval [ ci ] % - 32.9% ) , the baseline rate of hospitalization was / 100,000 ( 95% ci - 210.6 ) and the baseline rate of death was / 100,000 ( 95% ci - 70.6 ) .",these results were based on the assumption that the illness rates would be similar to their values in the influenza pandemic .
the effectiveness of the intervention varied as a function of the percentage of ill persons required for closing a school and the duration of the closure ( figure ) .,"for example , if each school were closed for days when the proportion of ill children exceeded %, then the overall illness rate was 88 ( 95% ci 78 - 0.297 ) ."
"a delay of , , or days occurred between onset of symptoms ( which coincided with the onset of infection ) and the beginning of the confinement period .",this delay and the proportion of households that complied with the confinement rules affected the effectiveness of the intervention .
"figure presents the dynamics of the pandemic ( a ) without any intervention , ( b ) when schools are closed for days as the proportion of ill children exceed %, and ( c ) when ill persons and all their household contacts are confined after the second day of illness of the index case - patient and compliance is %.","reducing contacts also decreased the rates of hospitalization and death in the general population by up to % and %, respectively ."
we assumed that % of ill persons without severe symptoms were confined to home within days of symptom onset .,"when the fraction of infected persons who developed symptoms was increased from 7 to 3 , then the illness rate without an intervention ( i . e . , at the baseline level ) changed only from 33 to 19 , while implementation of the intervention changed this rate from 72 to 42 ."
we used a stochastic simulation model to estimate the effectiveness of several interventions that could reduce contact rates on pandemic - related outcomes .,"shortages in the supply of neuraminidase inhibitors , the antiviral agents most likely to be effective against a pandemic influenza strain , and the months needed from the isolation of a pandemic strain until the availability of vaccine suggest that reducing contact rates between infected and uninfected persons will represent one of the few sets of interventions that can be rapidly implemented ."
"these mild decreases in the rates of illness and death after school closures are elained by the fact that in our models , children whose schools were closed were more likely to increase their contacts with other groups .",the attack rate of % that we used for school - age children may be considered high .
residents of ltcfs are likely to be at high risk for serious pandemic - related illness and death .,"we found that by limiting contacts of ill residents , illness and death may be reduced among other residents ."
"however , the major findings of this study seem to be robust , given a range of realistic values for the parameters we used .","the target attack rates we used to calibrate the contact parameters ( provided in the supplemental materials appendi are high , but lowering these attack rates should not have a major effect on our findings , because both the pre - and postintervention incidence rates would decrease concomitantly ."
"if a large number of school days are lost , school districts might consider extending the school year , which would incur additional costs , although the conditions would be eected to vary greatly between school districts .",these increased costs would have to be weighed against the limited predicted effectiveness of this intervention .
"in summary , if persons who suspect they are infected with pandemic influenza virus were to withdraw to their homes quickly , the rates of illness and death associated with a pandemic may be substantially reduced .","in future work , we will elore the effectiveness of early dismissal of students from schools , together with changes in out - of - school contacts , and other interventions using our model ."
"the competitive landscape of available technologies is characterized by clear sep - aration of very sensitive and quantitative methods measuring single bioanalytes [ real - time polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) , transcription mediated amplification , ligase chain reaction , rolling circle amplification , and so forth ] and methods capable of multiplexing thousands of genes ( dna microarrays , serial analysis of gene eression , differential display , and so forth ) with less sensitivity and quantitative ability compared to single gene methods .","nucleic acid testing of clinical samples and tissues is increasingly widespread and applied to various areas of medicine and diagnostics including pathogen identification , blood bank testing , cancer recurrence , and prediction of clinical outcome ."
each amplicon must vary by at least nucleotides in size .,pcr primers are designed for each target so that the amplicon length serves as a unique identifier for each particular target .
samples were injected at kv for seconds and separated at kv on pop4 polymer .,"after a predetermined number of cycles , l aliquots were collected at the end of successive cycles and immediately added to l of formamide containing rox - labeled dna standards ( bioventures , freesboro , tn ) followed by heat denaturation and separation by ce using the genetic analyzer ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca ) ."
the - primer contained a - nucleotide d ( t ) tail that allowed addition of a poly ( a ) during rna preparation .,pcr products were gel purified and transcribed using t7 rna polymerase ( stratagene ) generating artificial transcripts that contained common and nucleic acid sequences at each end and a poly ( a ) tail at the end .
each sample was serially diluted - fold from the starting concentration in % bovine serum albumin and amplified in a one - step rt - pcr protocol using mol / l primers .,"for taqman probe - based real - time rt - pcr assays ( taqman ) using 66 mol / l probe , cycling parameters were cycle of c for minutes , c for seconds followed by cycles of c for seconds , c for seconds , c for minute ."
star cycling parameters were identical to that of sybr except that rt was performed at c for minutes followed by c for minutes before pcr amplification .,the annealing temperature for the multiplex star reaction was c .
"resultant cdnas were purified using the qiaquick gel extraction kit ( qiagen ) as per the manufacturer ' s instructions , except that l of qg buffer was added to each sample .","for second strand synthesis , purified cdna in mmol / l tris ( ph ) , mmol / l mgcl , mmol / l nacl , mmol / l dntps was heat denatured at c for minute followed by addition of mol / l second strand primers and continued denaturation at c for minutes ."
"rna extractions were performed using high pure viral rna kit ( roche diagnostics , mannheim , germany ) .",the copy number of sars - cov rna was quantified against reference standards using the lightcycler sars - cov quantification kit ( roche diagnostics ) .
"one - step amplification of sars transcripts was performed as described above using appropriate fluorescently labeled forward and reverse primers for cycle of c for minutes , c for minutes , followed by cycles of c for seconds , c for seconds , c for minute .",sars - cov rna samples were diluted in escherichia coli trna at g / ml .
peaks representing each of the amplified targets are depicted in sequential electropherograms derived from pcr cycles through ( figure b ) .,"three - l aliquots were collected after successive pcr cycles through , separated by ce and analyzed ."
"to allow direct comparison between protocols , the pcr primer sequences used for each assay were identical with the exceptions that taqman hydrolysis probe was added for taqman assays and the forward pcr primers were fluorescently labeled for star assays .",twofold serially diluted samples of total brain rna were used as sample templates .
this is likely due to more efficient or promiscuous priming during reverse transcription resulting from the increased number of primers present in multiplex reactions that can anneal to rna templates at low reaction temperatures ( 42 c ; figure ) .,"we do , however , find that the cycle threshold is often lower in multiplexed samples than samples amplified individually ."
"three artificial transcripts [ vs31 ( 450 bases ) , vs32 ( 377 bases ) , and vs85 ( 544 bases ) ] were - fold serially diluted from , 000,000 to copies and pcr amplified in multiplex using a common pair of fluorescently labeled primers as each transcript contains common sequences at their and ends ( see materials and methods ) .","to address the absolute sensitivity of star assays , we performed eeriments using artificial transcripts spiked into carrier trna ( 20 g / ml ; sigma , st . louis , mo ) ."
targets were selected so that the predicted amplicon size was unique to each transcript .,"to illustrate the multiplexing capacity of star , we performed simultaneous amplification of transcripts from a sample of total rat brain rna using a one - step star protocol ( figure ) ."
this approach dramatically decreases the complexity of pcr amplification thus allowing multiplexing even greater numbers of genes / biomarkers .,"resultant cdnas are pooled and pcr amplified using a simplified primer set : reverse primers st1 and st2 , each labeled with a different fluorophore thereby allowing the sample source to be identified by specific color , and a gene - specific primer for each target effectively reducing the number of required pcr primers in half ( n sequences require n pcr primers ) ."
"to demonstrate that residual peaks were not due to nonspecific priming of spiked vs31 , the eeriment was repeated without spiking ( figure b , bottom ) .","as shown , the vs31 fragment is absent while background peaks amplified from the total rna background are still present ."
"we found that both fluorophores ned and vic could be used in combination with fam and , unlike rox , do not produce a shift in peak size .","using these labels , we observed completely overlapping peaks ( figure c ) ."
"fifty pg of vs31 was spiked into two rat rna samples , whereas amount of vs85 differed - fold in these samples .","analysis of the amplification plot ( figure d ) demonstrated that , as eected , equal amounts of target rna were amplified with the same kinetics ."
during this process we found that replacing taq polymerase with vent ( e ) polymerase significantly improved the detectability of pcr products ( data not shown ) .,primers detecting the rep1b and s genes that showed the best amplification efficiencies were selected for a one - step multiplex rt - pcr protocol .
"using our optimized assay , both s and rep1b gene targets were detected from , 000 to copies using sars - cov rna isolated from infected cultured vero cells ( data not shown ) .",the assay was further validated using mock clinical samples created by serial dilution of purified sars - cov rna into purified rna samples obtained from uninfected donors ( figure ) .
"both sars - cov target sequences , s and rep1b , were correctly detected in four tissue samples ( intestine , lymph node , spleen , and throat swab ) obtained from an individual who had contracted sars and subsequently died from the disease .",results of the star assay were then compared with those obtained using the roche lightcycler quantification kit .
star technology extends this concept to enable real - time pcr algorithms for quantification of multiple targets within a single reaction .,"rather than setting up separate pcr reactions for each aliquot , star monitors pcr amplification by withdrawing an aliquot from the same reaction tube after each successive cycle ."
we have previously found that amplification efficiencies can be differentially affected by covalent modifications of primers ( data not shown ) .,"taqman assays can also show variable pcr efficiencies based on nucleotide composition , hybridization kinetics , and probe positioning ."
"for targets that show high sequence variability such as hiv - 1 , a broader scope of options for primer design is available .","first , star tolerates a much broader range of amplicon size ( 50 to bases with current abi ce systems ) than current real - time pcr methods ( generally limited to to bases ) enabling efficient choice of primer pairs that are compatible based on shared physical properties and composition ."
"importantly , development of this assay required no primer optimization because the first set selected by commonly used primer design software was successfully implemented .","moreover , multiplexing with star is only limited by the separation power of ce , which can separate hundreds of dna fragments differing by a single nucleotide in size ."
each fragment can be predicted from available genomic sequence data or identified by sequencing to define the eressed transcriptome for each of the tissues .,"because the real - time quantitative algorithm used in star provides better quantification of small differences as well as a much broader dynamic range allowing broadly eressed transcripts to be analyzed , this database could serve as a diagnostic tool because the presence / absence and eression level of each fragment would be known ."
any star assay can be easily updated by addition or subtraction of particular primer pair ( s ) as long as there is no overlap in amplicon size .,"finally , the star protocol is adaptable to high - throughput automation that in its simplest form would include a dispensing thermocycler coupled to ce ."
"a specialized instrument that integrates pcr thermocycling , sample dispensing , and capillary - based separation is currently under development .","aside from instrument design , star development would also require a comprehensive bioinformatics package spanning multiplex primer design to management of gene eression data generated by star ."
we applied a precision public health strategy to syndromic surveillance for severe acute respiratory infection ( sari ) in uganda by combining spatiotemporal analytics with genomic sequencing to detect and characterize viral respiratory pathogens with epidemic potential .,precision public health is a novel set of methods to target disease prevention and mitigation interventions to highrisk subpopulations .
"using a precision approach to public health surveillance , we detected and characterized the genomics of vaccine - preventable and zoonotic respiratory viruses associated with clusters of severe respiratory infections in uganda .","future studies are needed to assess the feasibility , scalability , and impact of applying similar approaches during real - time public health surveillance in low - income settings ."
"in many circumstances , traditional public health surveillance systems in low - and middle - income countries have failed to detect or control these outbreaks , because they are not designed to capture high - resolution data on subpopulations of interest and may lack capacity to rapidly characterize highly divergent or novel pathogens .","in addition , outbreaks of severe acute respiratory infection ( sari ) associated with novel viruses ( such as avian influenza viruses and the middle east respiratory syndrome [ mers ] and severe acute respiratory syndrome [ sars ] coronaviruses ) and periodic outbreaks caused by vaccine - preventable viruses ( such as measles viruses ) continue to threaten global health security ."
"for syndromic sari surveillance , such programs accumulate incidence data from multiple sources across a catchment area , after which they use a variety of nonstatistical methods to detect a public health signal of concern .","these signal detection methods , challenged by difficulties adjusting for natural temporal and geographical variation and adequate population - at - risk data , are limited by poor specificity and imprecise spatiotemporal resolution ."
"this approach could allow for rapid detection and characterization of epidemic - prone respiratory viruses prior to large - scale emergence , identification of populations at risk for severe outcomes , and targeted investment of public health resources ( ie , vaccination ) among heavily affected subpopulations .","precision surveillance applies spatiotemporal analytics to routinely collected surveillance data to identify loci with increased risk of disease ( ie , sari ) incidence , and combines this data with genomic sequencing to provide sensitive detection and high - resolution characterization of circulating pathogens ."
"using data from a national sari surveillance network , we retrospectively applied spatiotemporal analysis to identify clusters of unelained , influenza - negative sari in uganda from to .",we combined this approach with a minimally biased viral oligonucleotide probe capture and high - throughput sequencing platform to detect and characterize circulating viral respiratory pathogens associated with these clusters .
geographically diverse sentinel sites and sari case definitions were chosen in accordance with world health organization ( who ) protocols .,eligible cases were patients age months presenting to surveillance sites who met sari case definitions .
nasopharyngeal and / or oropharyngeal swab samples were collected from each patient and shipped to uvri using an established protocol .,"for all sari cases , testing was initially done for influenza a and b viruses using real - time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) with primers provided by us centers for disease control and prevention ."
"the maximum spatial and temporal event magnitudes were set as kilometers and days , respectively .","eected case counts are determined using data aggregated across the entire data set , both before and after the detected cluster ."
sequences that showed poor or no homology at the nucleotide level were screened by blastx against the viral genbank protein database .,"based on the identified contigs , genbank sequences were downloaded and used for mapping the whole data set to recover partial or complete genomes ."
fisher exact or tests were used to compare categorical variables and medians were compared using the mann - whitney u test .,"univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios and % confidence intervals ( spss version , ibm ) ."

"the largest clusters occurred in wakiso , central uganda from march to may and tororo , eastern uganda , from july to august ( table , figure ) .","the median size , radius , and duration of these clusters was cases ( interquartile range [ iqr ] - 44 cases ) , kilometers ( iqr - 16.7 ) , and days ( iqr - 58 days ) , respectively ."
"of sari cases associated with cluster events , nasopharyngeal and / or oropharyngeal swab samples from ( 66.1% ) cases were available to undergo analysis with vircapseq - vert .","due to low nucleic acid quality , samples were omitted from further analysis ."
"human rhinoviruses , cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) , respiratory syncytial viruses ( rsv ) , measles virus , and human parainfluenza viruses ( hpiv ) were the most commonly detected pathogens , accounting for %, %, %, %, and % of virus - positive samples , respectively ( table and supplementary figure s1 ) .","among these , coinfection with viruses was identified in ( 50.7% ) ."
"this individual was found to have measles infection associated with genotype d4 upon return to england ( dr . bakamutumaho , personal communication ) .","epidemiologic investigations revealed that a year - old , unvaccinated british tourist had traveled to the central region of uganda in january shortly after developing a febrile illness with rash ."
"within a sari cluster in wakiso , central uganda , we identified a hospital - based cluster of sari associated with a novel picobirnavirus ( pbv ) , a double - stranded , bisegmented rna virus .",the first case was a - year - old female farmer who was hospitalized march nd .
"as associated costs continue to decrease logarithmically , it is likely that genomic sequencing will become part of routine surveillance in the near future .",no enhances this approach by applying spatiotemporal analytics to routinely collected surveillance data and combines these methods with genomic sequencing to enhance targeted investigation and control of infectious diseases .
"although pathogens associated with many clusters ( human rhinovirus , rsv , and hpiv ) could have been detected using multiplexed pcr platforms , use of vircapseq - vert resulted in detection of highly contagious yet vaccine - preventable pathogens ( measles , rubella ) that would not have been detected using more biased diagnostics .","given advantages in detection yield and impactful genomic analyses , vircapseq - vert should be a powerful molecular tool for global virologic surveillance moving forward ."
"given the potential benefits of high - dose vitamin a supplementation , heightened clinician awareness for measles , as well as enhanced infection control , should be encouraged among patients presenting with severe respiratory infections in endemic areas .","on a global scale , our findings suggest that genotype d4 measles virus circulating in uganda was likely imported from england , where suboptimal rates of immunization have resulted in recurrent measles outbreaks ."
zoonotic spillover from wild or domestic animals to a farmer and subsequent nosocomial transmission to an immunocompromised laboratory worker is a plausible epidemiologic pathway based on viral sequence and epidemiologic data .,"given the array of animal species in which pbv has been detected ( poultry , pigs , dogs , monkeys , camels , and snakes ) , enhanced surveillance is needed to better define the host range , transmissibility , and pathogenicity of this potentially emerging , zoonotic virus ."
"environmentally , two thirds of sari clusters originated during rainy season months and districts located within these clusters had higher annual rainfall .",this signal is consistent with data suggesting that human population density and increasing population growth in urban areas are significant predictors of infectious disease emergence worldwide .
we detected cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) in over % of virus - positive samples in a largely pediatric population with low reported prevalence of hiv - infection .,"this is consistent with data reported from zambia , in which cmv was the most commonly identified virus in upper respiratory tract samples from a large cohort of children with sari ."
"third , we did not sequence samples from cases occurring outside of spatiotemporally defined clusters .","second , our viral detection strategy relied on upper respiratory tract samples that may reflect carriage and not lower respiratory tract infection ."
"our study demonstrates that precision surveillance strategies can enhance detection and characterization of previously unrecognized , epidemic - prone viral respiratory pathogens .",continued development and evaluation of similar approaches are needed to enhance targeted delivery of public health resources in low - income settings .

"the s indel pedv strains from the united states shared % - 100% nt identity with each other for the entire s gene , and they shared % - 97.1% nt identity with the other pedv strains from north america .","in contrast to findings from the complete - genome analysis , findings from the s gene analysis indicated that strain ch / zmzdy / 11 , but not strain ah2012 , from china was most closely related to the non - s indel pedv strains from the united states ."
"nucleotide sequence comparison showed that these s indels ( 1 - nt , - nt , and - nt deletions at positions , , and , respectively , and a - nt insertion between positions and ) were identical in the us pedv strains and global s indel strains .",the first branch contained global pedv sequences lacking the s indels ; the second branch contained global pedv s indel strains with us and non - us sublineages .
the remainder of the s1 region and the full s2 region of the s gene shared high nucleotide identity among the us and global pedv strains .,"phylogenetic analysis of these regions showed that s indel and non - s indel pedv strains from the united states were most closely related to strain ch / zmzdy / 11 , but not to strain ah2012 , from china ( data not shown ) ."
phylogenetic analysis of orf did not show any specific differences between the s indel and non - s indel pedv strains from the united states ( data not shown ) .,"all pedv strains from north america grouped together , sharing % - 95.7% nt identity ."
"phylogenetic analyses of the genes for e , m , and n structural proteins showed that all pedv strains from north america formed a monophyletic branch , sharing % - 100% nt identity , and there were no major differences in these genomic regions ( data not shown ) .","the e and m gene phylogenetic analyses showed monophyletic clustering of the strains from north america with some recent strains from china : ch / fjzz - 9/2012 and ch / fjnd - 3/2011 for e gene and bj - 2011 - 1 , js - hz2012 , ch / zmzdy / 11 , ch / fjzz - 9/2012 , and ah2012 for m gene ."
"therefore , the potential recombination breakpoints in the s indel strain genome may have been located between orf a and orf b , between s1 and s2 , and between orf and e gene .","in contrast , the s indel strain usa / iowa107 / 2013 appeared to possess a composite genome structure : the orf a region was most similar to that of strain ah2012 , the orf b region was substantially more similar to that of strain ch / zmdzy / 11 , the s gene s1 region was most similar to that of strain ch / s , and the s2 region was most similar to that of strain ch / zmzdy / 11 ."
"despite the very recent emergence of pedv in north america , our findings show substantial genetic heterogeneity among the strains .","our findings also confirm , as postulated by others , that strain ah2012 from china shares an ancestral strain with the non - s indel strains in north america ."
"the recently identified , dating back to june , , s indel pedv strains from the united states possess several distinct molecular traits .",these traits create uncertainty regarding the parental strain ( s ) of these pedvs and indicate that they could have originated from multiple recombination events before their introduction into the united states .
"therefore , whether s indel pedv generation represents a mechanism of adaptation to a partially immune pig population after initial infection with highly virulent non - s indel strains is unclear .","the immunologic cross - protection in pigs between s indel and non - s indel pedv strains in the united states is unknown , but in asia , the historic s indel vaccines ( cv777 lineage ) failed to protect against the virulent pedv strains that emerged after ."
"the mechanisms governing the virulence of pedv ( or coronaviruses in general ) may be redundant , or the s indel strains may be an intermediate between those of virulent and attenuated pedvs ( e . g . , lower virulence ) .",the higher level of nucleotide conservation of the north american pedv strains in the e and m genes and greater genetic variability of n gene may be representative of geographic specificity rather than virulence .
active epidemiologic surveillance and immunologic studies are urgently needed to understand pedv evolution worldwide and to develop optimal pedv vaccines .,this possibility should be confirmed by thoroughly assessing the immune responses to pedv in the us swine that were sources of the s indel pedv variant strains and by conducting eerimental pig inoculation and cross - protection studies .
"the findings reveal that hotel management and performance is the theme most frequently examined by researchers , followed by hotel development strategies , and hotel business environment analysis .","the analysis also indicates shifts in research methods , trends of publication , journal outlets and authorship information ."
"this isolation was most notably evidenced through lack of participation in the transnational travel environment , and was an era characterised by suppressed tourism and limited hotel development ( pine & qi , , chapter ) .","the first is , when the establishment of the people ' s republic and the advent of communist rule introduced an insular society focused on internal political struggle , resulting in the country ' s international isolation ."
"the chinese hotel industry has grown rapidly since the first international hotel joint venture in ( stross , ) .","in , of the largest hotel companies in the world were headquartered in china , half of which were in hong kong and half in the mainland ( gale , ) ."
the purpose of this paper is to systematically review and analyse the english language academic literature related to hotel research in china .,"as china ' s hotel industry continues to grow , it is important to develop an understanding of how the academic research in this area evolves ."
"it also reflects the trend that in the international academic community china attracts increasing attention from researchers ( fetscherin , voss , & gugler , ) .","this review literature is wide - ranging and diverse in coverage of disciplines , geography , and topics , but is united in the attempt to give us a big picture and synthesis of the relevant research topics / fields to date ."
"they were strategy and development , marketing , service quality , and human resource management .","the authors also provided a summary list of the publications , albeit with limited analysis and discussion ."
"furthermore , it was also noted that the pace of publications generated from asian universities overtook that from western institutions .",a diverse nature of the research themes was found in this study .
the aggregate knowledge from the china research synthesis studies above demonstrates the broad scope that has been adopted by researchers examining the research themes in the chinese hotel industry .,"the studies also provide a variety of approaches to synthesis in the context of china hospitality research , as analysed in the method section below ."
"the total number of papers included in our study was , almost twice the number of the papers collected in the kong and cheung study .","starting from papers identified by kong and cheung , we also searched hospitality and tourism complete and science direct for more relevant research publication ."
meta - analysis may also apply quantitative methods that compensate for methodological variations among the studies in order to render the findings metrically equivalent .,"meta - interpretation takes an interpretivist approach to the synthesis of multiple studies on a topic that have used disparate methods , typically using qualitative techniques for analysis ( weed , ) ."
"shelby and vaske provide a useful analysis of the methodological definitional dilemmas in review studies , identifying the main areas of confusion as total methodology vs . an analysis technique , the use of effect sizes , the unit of analysis , and meta - analysis vs . comparative analysis .","such variability of interpretation is to be eected among methods for which a single , definitive framework is yet to be determined ."
"the systematic review approach provides a rigorous and transparent compilation that serves to map an area containing dispersed and diverse knowledge ( weed , ) .","the present study adopted the systematic review approach , characterised by a comprehensive search for relevant studies on china hotel research , which were then evaluated and synthesised according to the content analysis method ."
we believe the combination of using the two databases would provide a most cost - effective way to locate english language academic literature in relation to china hotel research .,the pool of papers selected met the criteria of english language refereed academic journal papers .
"main findings include research themes , research methods , trends of publication , journal outlets , and authorship information .",a content analysis was conducted to identify research themes and trends .
"in there was not a single course offered in hospitality and tourism at any chinese higher education institution ( zhao , ) .","with the rapid growth of the tourism and hospitality industry , the shortage of qualified staff became a severe problem ."
employee satisfaction is believed to be an important factor to maintain employee loyalty .,"high turnover rate is common in the hospitality industry ( tian & pu , ) ."
"li , tse , and xie investigated general managers ' demographic characteristics and career paths .","burke , koyuncu , wang , and fiksenbaum examined potential antecedents and consequences of work engagement in hotel managers ."
"by examining customer and employee perceptions of green hotels , heung , fei , and hu suggested that government and industry should cooperate to promote the green culture to the public .","yan , child , and chong addressed the development requirements in terms of the application of firm - specific assets and human resource management needed for the implementation of vertical integration decisions in an international firm ."
littrell compared desirable and actual leadership traits exhibited by managers and supervisors and found that leadership traits outside task and person orientation appear to be highly culture - specific .,"hu , cai , and kavanaugh examined the impact of cultural differences on employee behaviours in china and uk hotels ."
"hotel managers and operators started to pay more attention to the administration and operation of hotels , and adopted a more strategic management style to achieve better hotel performance .","problems associated with the fast growth included lack of coordination in hotel administration owing to the complicated bureaucratic and financial structure ( zhao , ) , ineerienced workforce ( zhao , ) , and inadequate and unreliable information for marketing and planning ( liu & liu , ) ."
"zhi , wang , and turban noted the deficiency in the management support systems of state - owned hotel enterprises .","qu , ennew , and sinclair examined determinants of market orientation ( government regulation , ownership structure , and organisational factors ) for the hotel sector ."
entry in into the world trade organization ( wto ) marked a significant event for china .,"however , china ' s membership in wto also meant less government control in the hotel industry and vulnerability of local industry to greater competition from foreign companies ( pine , ) ."
"li , tse , and gu revealed significant positive correlations between entrepreneurial orientation and the key dimensions of strategic planning .",ma advised the application of balanced scorecard into strategic hotel management .
revealed radon levels in hot spring hotels which may pose health risks for employees .,revealed carbonyl compound levels in hotel ballrooms in china and song et al .
"aspects such as impacts of online user reviews ( ye , law , & gu , ) , performance of the new distribution channel - websites ( hsu , zhu , & agrusa , ; hui , law , & ye , ; law & liang , ) , and impact of website quality ( bai , law , & wen , ) were also examined under this theme .",online marketing as a new and effective approach drew considerable attention from researchers .
"researchers also revealed factors influencing customer satisfaction which include hotels ' star rating ( ryan & gu , ) , personal service quality ( wang & pearson , ) , client information needs and online security for online users ( kim , ma , & kim , ) , and external environment , reputation and bedroom cleanliness ( gu & ryan , ) .","three papers focused on service quality gaps between tourist perception and eectation ( qu & tsang , ; wang , wang , & zhao , ) and between tourists and hotel managers ( tsang & qu , ) ."
disclosed that culture had a significant impact on customer perception and eectation .,"country - of - origin stereotypes were shown to have an impact on chinese customers ' perceptions of hotel chains ' service ( zhou et al . , ) ."
"issues under research in this sub - category included financial investment , risk analysis , financial performance and profitability .",hines and tisdell and wen ( 1 9 9 1 a ) investigated the formation of investment for hotels .
spatial distribution of hotels in china was discussed in begin ' s and shu and dai ' s studies .,yu ( 1 9 9 2 b ) noted the roles of various chinese government agencies and foreign investors in the development of china hotels .
"other less directly - related issues were also addressed by researchers , for instance , jackson suggested to develop regional tourism clusters including hotels in order to foster competitive advantage in regional china ; chan et al .","evaluated the performance of solar control film in hotels and indicated that with more public awareness of sustainable development , environmental - friendly services will be more welcomed in hotels ."
a small number of papers used sophisticated statistical methods / techniques such as structural equation modelling ( sem ) .,"commonly adopted statistical methods / techniques in all the papers included correlation test , regressions , anova , t - test and factor analysis ."
"although the number of empirical papers far outweighs that of the other two types , it is not suggested that empirical papers are better than conceptual papers and case studies .",all three types of papers can address academic problems from different aspects if they are effectively designed and used .
"given the fact that earlier papers may not be available online , it still makes sense that hotel development in china has attracted increasing research attention from academics , especially after the year of .",shows a general upward trend of number of papers published during the - year period .
in and the heated growth slowed down and the average hotel occupancy rate dropped below % .,"from to , foreign investment was introduced and the industry eerienced an unprecedented growth ."
"hong kong and taiwan were counted separately from mainland china , as they have different research systems ( law & cheung , ) .",the location of the author ' s institution was counted rather than the nationality of the author .
"the reason for this phenomenon might be , as suggested by sheldon , that many authors tended to publish their hospitality research in journals related to their individual fields .","the study found that the papers were published in different journals , including eight of the top ten hospitality journals rated by mckercher , law , and lam horizons , were found to contribute one paper each to the paper pool ."
"this phenomenon could be attributed to the reason that a substantial number of authors were likely to be graduate students or short contract lecturers affiliated with the institutions at the time of publication ; they might have stopped publishing or been transferred to other research fields ( jogaratnam , mccleary , mena , & yoo , ; law & cheung , ) .",it is also apparent that more than half of the authors were onetime authors .
"while we must be circumspect in comparing review studies without directly overlapping search criteria , we nevertheless see the relevance of comparison with other key review studies .",there are a number of significant convergences as well as divergences of the present study findings with those of the extant review studies described in the introduction section above .
"in tsang and hsu ' s study , out of a total of papers , were identified to fall into the theme of hotel development .","as tsang and hsu ' s study covers the general literature of china tourism and hospitality research and their review scope appears to be much broader than that in our current study , little meaningful comparison can be drawn between our study findings and theirs ."
"thus interpretation of findings must be done cautiously , and the most thorough understanding may be gained by considering the findings of such review studies in the aggregate level .","types of analysis contribute further to diversity , as different groups of authors interpret the papers under study in different ways ."
"since lynn and mullen observed the nascent and spare use of meta - level analyses published in hospitality journals , such methods remain underused in hospitality research generally ( see sainaghi , ) .","the aggregation and analysis of meta - types of synthesis will broaden our understanding of the shapes of hospitality research knowledge ( weed , ) ."
the present study is subject to similar limitations eressed in the works that we have reviewed .,"defining the boundaries of a systematic review is an arbitrary process , and by definition excludes data that may be considered relevant to the review topic ."
"the potential for temporary nonspecific immunity between respiratory viruses after an infection and consequent interference at the population level between epidemics of these viruses has been hypothesized , with limited empirical evidence to date , mainly from ecological studies .",we investigated the incidence of acute upper respiratory tract infections ( urtis ) associated with virologically confirmed respiratory virus infections in a randomized controlled trial of influenza vaccination .
we defined the followup period for each participant from days after receipt of tiv or placebo to collection of midstudy serum samples as the winter season and from collection of midstudy samples through final serum sample obtainment as the summer season .,"participants were followed up for illnesses through symptom diaries and telephone calls , and illness reports in any household member triggered home visits during which nasal and throat swab specimens ( ntss ) were collected from all household members ."
"proxy written informed consent was obtained for all participants from their parents or legal guardians , with additional written assent from those years of age .",the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of hong kong university .
"we refer to infections determined by these assays as "" confirmed "" infections .",ntss were tested for respiratory viruses by the resplex ii plus multiplex array and for influenza a and b by reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) ( supplementary appendi .
"all statistical analyses were conducted using r , version 1.0 ( r development core team , vienna , austria ) .","because duration of follow - up varied by participant , we estimated the incidence rates of ari and fari episodes and confirmed viral infections overall and during the winter and summer seasons and estimated the relative risk of these episodes for participants who received tiv versus placebo with use of the incidence rate ratio using poisson regression ( supplementary appendi ."
"we collected ntss from participants at times when one of their household contacts reported an acute urti but the participants were not ill , and identified viruses in of the specimens ( 4% ) , including influenza a ( h3n2 ) , coackie / echovirus , and coronavirus e .","we detected respiratory viruses in of ntss ( 49% ) collected during ari episodes , which included of ( 55% ) fari episodes ."
"it is less likely that the interference observed here could be elained by reduced community eures during convalescence ( ie , behavioral rather than immunologic factors ) .",the duration of any temporary nonspecific immunity remains uncertain but could be of the order of - 4 weeks based on these observations .
ecological studies have reported phenomena potentially elained by viral interference .,the phenomenon of virus interference has been well known in virology for > 60 years .
our results are limited by the small sample size and the small number of confirmed infections .,"despite this limitation , we were able to observe a statistically significant increased risk incidence rates are from respiratory specimens collected from participants aged - 15 years who received trivalent influenza vaccine or placebo during acute respiratory illness episodes ."
temporary nonspecific immunity leading to interference between epidemics of respiratory viruses could have important implications .,"finally , acute urti incidence was based on self - report with regular telephone reminders , and we may have failed to identify some illnesses despite rigorous prospective follow - up ."
animal studies and volunteer adult human challenge studies could provide useful evidence .,"additional community - based observational cohort studies and community - based eerimental studies , such as our vaccine trial , may be particularly suitable for investigating temporary nonspecific immunity , because most acute urtis do not require medical attention ."
"among the various species of plasmodium , p . falciparum is the most lethal one causing the most virulent form of human malaria .","annually , p . falciparum is known to cause e300 million infections and e3 million deaths ."
the main target of most of the antimalarial drugs is the erythrocytic stage of malarial infection .,) are available in market for the treatment of malaria .
"the interesting antimalarial properties of fq stimulated the extensive development of its analogues with the hope of increased efficacy , lower side effects and the ability to overcome resistance by malarial parasites .","presently , several classes of fq derivatives and analogues have been prepared and tested for antimalarial properties , and interesting results have been obtained in several instances ."
"an analysis of the number of publications on "" fq and its derivatives as antimalarial agents "" from to indicated a steadily growing interest in the research on this topic .",the period from to was divided into three intervals viz .
the recrudescences are thought to be due to persistent blood infections .,"during prepatent period , the infected individuals may not have any characteristic symptoms ."
"approximately , billion people are at high risk out of billion people ; who get eure to the malarial infections every year , globally .","world health organization ( who ) indicated more than million people with symptomatic malaria in addition to , 000 deaths in ."
"it was very much surprising to obtain disappointing results with the ferrocenyl incorporated mefloquine , quinine , artemisinin and atovaquone .","the strategic incorporation of ferrocenyl moieties into the structures of well - known antimalarial agents was first tried during the mid - 1 9 9 0 s , and still yet these structural designs and their investigations are continuing ."
fq was the most active compound out of this class .,additional studies were carried out to find out a molecule with better activity and a more reasonable cost for industrial production .
replaced the hydrogen atom on the aniline n of fq by a methyl group to produce fq - me .,"it was observed that fq - me exhibited similar physico - chemical properties as that of fq , and also demonstrated ability to inhibit b - haematin formation ."
cq acts by accumulating in the digestive vacuoles of parasite and consequently prevents the crystallization of toxic heme into hemozoin .,this results in membrane damage and the death of parasite .
"thus , on account of the absence of any noticeable immunotoxicity in rats along with in vitro efficacy against cq - resistant strains , fq was suggested as an effective alternative treatment for p . falciparum .","interestingly , the results in both in vitro tests on field isolates and in vivo investigations on rodent models revealed that the potential resistance to fq was not dependent on a gene polymorphism that is involved in cq resistance ."
these micro species are known to interact with haematin and enable its conversion into hemozoin .,some reports indicated that fq is - folds more lipophilic than cq at cytosolic ph .
"besides , fq was supposed to play a crucial role in the inhibition of merozoites reinvasion .",metallocenic moiety was proved as an important contributor to the overall mechanism of action of fq .
several classes of structurally diverse molecules have been designed and developed in a hope to ensure resistance free death of malarial parasites .,there was a huge interest in the development of antimalarial drugs based on fq template after the initial success of fq as an antimalarial agent .
the ic values of e3 against d7 and w2 strains of p . falciparum in comparison to cq and fq are given in table .,"interestingly , these compounds also exhibited antiviral effects with selectivity towards severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov infection ) ."
"however , there is need to lower the dosage below which a complete cure can be obtained .","for that purpose , new molecules based on these templates are in need to be developed and investigated in future ."
"all the compounds were found to associate with haematin , however , this association was not an important force for the in vitro activity .","besides , the presence of an intramolecular h - bond was not determinant for antiplasmodial activity ."
the ic values have been taken in reference to the values of cq and fq .,"the ic values in and indicate compounds with activities higher than fq and cq , respectively ."
"besides , the rigid metallocenic compounds and , which were derived from fq displayed better falcipain - 2 inhibition as compared to the corresponding flexible alkyl analogues , , and .",it was interesting to note that only compound showed the typical food vacuole abnormality associated with inhibitors of falcipain - 2 .
dual prodrug strategies have been previously elored for the treatment of malaria [ 8 4 e92 ] .,the binding of two active molecular fragments increases the bioavailability of the dual molecule produced and enables the merging of active molecules with independent modes of action that prevents the emergence of resistance .
"all the compounds displayed high activity against the nf54 and dd2 strains of p . falciparum ( table ) with ic values in the range of 6 6 e30 . 73 0 and 3 7 e77 . 19 6 nm , respectively .","however , complex was the most active compound with ic values of 6 and 1 nm , respectively against nf54 and the dd2 strains ."
these results demonstrate the benefits of the incorporation of organosilicon moieties for the activity enhancement of existing and newly developed drugs .,"however , meaningful structureeactivity relationships , beneficial effects , and any evidences of cross resistance could be defined only after the compounds reported herein are screened against other sensitive and resistant strains of the malarial parasite ."
"overall , it was observed that the complexation of the second metal brought little effect to the overall activity of the compounds .",ferrocenyl ligands were more active than chloroquine - based gold or rhodium complexes against the resistant strains .
"the basic purpose of rational drug design using fq template or its analogues was to obtain new synthetic derivatives or analogues with better activity , lower toxicity and other therapeutic benefits in comparison to the standard antimalarials like cq and fq .","of course , several classes of fq derivatives have demonstrated better antimalarial activities than both cq and fq ."
"besides , some exciting templates can be chosen for further development of new efficient derivatives and analogues .","in nutshell , several fq derivatives and analogues demonstrated promising in vitro activities and deserve attention for further investigation in in vivo animal models ."
halofantrine has been established as unsuitable for widespread use in humans due to its potential cardiotoxicity .,"interestingly , the famous fq has been shown to respond negatively to the ames and fetax ( frog embryo teratogenesis assay xenopus ) tests ."
some of the derivatives are mildly toxic while some exhibit pronounced toxicities in comparison to cq and fq .,it is clear from the discussion in this section that some fq derivatives exhibit toxic effects towards normal cells .
"till now , there have been significant advances in the understanding of the molecular aetiology of malaria , but ideal therapeutic modalities are still missing .","thus , which other antimalarial molecules are active and should be investigated in near future is still a mystery ."
"in the present scenario , software and simulation programmes can be used to estimate drug therapeutic efficiency even before their actual syntheses .","thus , simulated drugs with good bioavailability , maximum solubility , remarkably less side effects and higher efficiency need to be designed and developed ."
"in this direction , the eloration of the antimalarial potentials of fq derivatives along with their mechanisms of action is a ray of hope .","definitely , the future of fq derivatives is quite bright since this is a step in the right direction towards the eradication of malaria ."
"nevertheless , the past decade has witnessed a revision of this concept , as evidenced by the fact that activated t lymphocytes , regardless of their antigen specificity , migrate effectively through the blood - brain barrier ( bbb ) , but also by the fact that the cns contains numerous resident cells , such as microglia , cerebral endothelial cells , and astrocytes , that can , under the appropriate conditions , acquire the eression of immune accessory molecules and may function as apc ( hickey , ; owens et al . , ) .","in physiologic states , the cns contains few , if any , leukocytes , and an absence of professional antigen - presenting cells ( apc ) ; it is barren for the eression of key immune accessory molecules such as major histocompatibility molecules ( mhcs ) , and is fortified by an effective blood - brain barrier ."
"therefore , increasing our knowledge of the mechanisms that control the trafficking of immune cells into the cns , and knowledge of the subsequent interactions between these cells that contribute to cns damage , is an important objective .","this host response can be a two - edged sword that , on the one hand , is needed to control and extinguish the invading virus but , on the other , can produce immune pathology and tissue injury resulting in mental and physical debilitation , and often death , of the host organism ."
these homologs may function to modulate local inflammatory responses and favor viral survival and spread .,"from the host perspective , accumulating evidence indicates that chemokines are plurifunctional molecules that may have a significant impact on the cns , regulating cellular communication in the developing and the normal adult cns ( asensio and campbell , ) ."
chemokines share a common three - dimensional structure including an nh2 - terminal loop and three antiparallel ~ sheets that are followed by a c - terminal a helix .,"the amino acid backbone of chemokines belonging to the cc , cxc , and cx3c families contains four conserved cysteines , while the c family chemokine , lymphotactin , contains only two cysteines , which correspond to the first and third cysteines in the other groups ."
"the glucocorticoid dexamethasone is also a particularly potent inhibitor for cc and cxc chemokine production ( tobler et al . , ; villiger et al . , ) .","for example , il - 10 and transforming growth factor ( tgf ) - ~ have been shown to inhibit lps - induced microglial cell rantes mrna eression and protein release ( hu et al . , ) ."
"cxcr4 mrna eression is also found in murine lymphocytes , macrophages , neutrophils , and glial cells .","as indicated above , disruption of the cxcr4 gene causes defects in vascular development , hematopoiesis , cardiogenesis , and neurogenesis of the cerebellum ."
"in addition , these animals have impaired trafficking of subsets of myeloid progenitor cells .","the primary receptor for mcp - 1 , ccr2 , is eressed on monocytes , myeloid precursor cells , activated t lymphocytes , and b lymphocytes but not on neutrophils ( bonecchi et al . , ; frade et al . , ; myers et al . , ) ."
"in conclusion , depending on their antigenic stimulation and / or polarization toward thl versus th2 subsets , chemokine receptors are differentially eressed , which , in addition to their characteristic cytokine profiles , may thus further distinguish these cells ( mantovani , b ) .","similar to human t helper cells , murine thl cells preferentially eressed ccr7 and ccr5 , whereas th2 cells eressed more ccr3 ( randolph et al . , ) ."
"lymphotactin , the lone member of the c - chemokine family , is produced by activated mouse t cells ( kelner et al . , ) .","lymphotactin is unique because it has only two cysteines , the second and the fourth , of the four cysteines conserved in the cxc , cc , and cx3c chemokines ; and the c - terminal sequence is much longer than those of other chemokines ."
this chemokine is found on activated endothelial cells and is tethered to the membrane by a mucinlike stalk that suggests a novel role for this chemokine in juxtacrine signaling .,"the interaction of endothelial - cell - eressed fractalkine with its receptor , cx3cr1 , on leukocytes mediates the initial capture , firm adhesion , and activation of circulating leukocytes independently of integrin or adhesion molecule involvement ( fong et al . , ) ."
many of the large dna viruses are infamous for their ability to undermine host immunity .,"two genres of viruses , the herpesviruses and poxviruses , were recently shown to contain open reading frames ( orfs ) that encode homologs of mammalian chemokines and chemokine receptors ( for detailed reviews , see ahuja et al . , ; dairaghi et al . , ; lalani et al . , ; murphy , ; smith et al . , ) ."
"kaposi ' s sarcoma is an angioproliferative disorder , so it is interesting that in addition to deviation of the host chemokine response , vmip - i and vmip - ii both induce angiogenesis in a chick chorioallantoic assay ( boshoff et al . , ) .",thus these viral chemokines might contribute directly to the pathogenesis of the proliferative angiopathy in kaposi ' s sarcoma .
"human and murine cmv possess genes that encode a variety of chemokine homologs ( macdonald et al . , ) .",cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) is a common opportunistic pathogen of immunocompromised hosts in whom the virus exhibits tropism for leukocytes .
"this gene , orf us28 , of human cytomegalovirus ( hcmv ) was shown to bind mip - la , - ~ , mcp - 1 , rantes , and mcp - 3 ( bodaghi et al . , ) with higher affinity than their cognate receptors .",a gene encoding a viral homolog of ccr1 was found within the genome of the human cmv .
"therefore , a primary function of this virus - encoded chemokine homolog might be to provide an immune evasion strategy that acts to limit the recruitment of effector leukocytes to mcvinfected epidermal cells .","furthermore , mc148r inhibits the leukocyte response to several cc and cxc chemokines ( damon et al . , ) , indicating that it can act as a broad - spectrum chemokine antagonist ."
"the examples discussed here indicate that these strategies are diverse and , depending on the virus , range from wholesale suppression of leukocyte trafficking - - providing immune evasion - - to promoting selective leukocyte chemotaxis fostering the more efficient infection and dissemination of virus via its preferred target host cell .","although the precise role of the viral chemokine and chemokine receptor homologs ( discussed above ) in infectious processes remains to be determined , they clearly could contribute to the strategies employed by these viruses to subvert host immunity ."
"importantly , these same cells are endowed with a variety of different chemokine receptors and therefore have the potential to respond to chemokines in their local environment .","as recently speculated by us ( asensio and campbell , ) and by others ( mennicken et al . , ) , it is likely the cns has its own chemokine ligand / receptor network , the function of which could extend well beyond the regulation of leukocyte trafficking in antiviral and other neuroimmune responses ( see fig ."
"more recently , mcp - 1 eression at the protein level was shown in the human cerebellum , medulla oblongata , and pons ( meng et al . , ) .","however , the function of constitutively eressed mcp - 1 in the brain is unknown ."
"furthermore , human sdfla was able to induce calcium flux in cultured astrocytes ( bajetto et al . , ) .","( 1 9 9 7 b ) showed that sdf - la was able to induce migration of microglial cells but not astrocytes , even though the sdf - 1 receptor , cxcr4 , was eressed on both cell types ."
"fractalkine treatment of primary cultured rat microglial cells induces vigorous increases in intracellular ca + levels and chemotaxis , which are inhibited by an antibody against the fractalkine ( cx3cr1 ) receptor .","although the precise function of fractalkine in the cns awaits clarification , the localization of the fractalkine receptor on microglia and the eression of its ligand by neurons clearly establish a spatial framework that could facilitate juxtacrine communication and migration between these cells ( see fig ."
"similarly , eression of ip - 10 by murine astrocytes and microglia can be induced by ifn - ~ / or lps ( luo et al . , ; majumder et al . , ; ren et al . , ; vanguri , ) .","although differential eression of mcp - 1 by astrocytes , and of mip - i ( z by microglia , was reported for murine glial cells ( hayashi et al . , ) , this was not the case with human microglia , with eression of both these chemokines being induced in these cells by lps ( mcmanus et al . , ) ."
"for example , mip - 2 is more potent than il - 8 , ip - 10 , or mcp - 1 in stimulating polymorphonu -",studies with intracerebral microinjection also demonstrate that the acute presence of chemokines in the cns leads to robust and cell - specific leukocyte recruitment .
"val ] ~ rie c . asensio and iain l . campbell clear leukocyte recruitment to the brain ( bell et al . , ) , while the cc chemokine c10 , when injected into the lateral ventricle , is able to induce a recruitment of macrophages , but not t cells ( asensio et al . , b ) .","finally , neutralization of the chemokine mip - la , which is eressed in eae , is associated with a reduction in disease severity and in cns inflammation ( karpus et al . , ) ."
"a clear theme emerging from all these studies is that neurons eress a variety of chemokine receptors and that this eression in the cns exhibits marked regional and cellular diversity , suggesting that chemokines could have differential effects on different neurons .","eression of cxcr4 has also been detected by immunohistochemical staining on subpopulations of neurons in the normal adult brain ( lavi et al . , ; sanders et al . , ; vallat et al . , ) , while in the rat , levels of the cxcr4 receptor rna are higher on specific neurons , which include cerebellar purkinje cells , hippocampal hilar neurons , and cerebral cortical neurons ( wong et al . , ) ."
"the fact that fractalkine is eressed by neurons ( as noted above ) , and its receptor by microglia , suggests a possible important role for this chemokine and its receptor in communication between neurons and microglia .","the fractalkine receptor cx3cr1 is found at high levels in rodent and human brain and shows strong localization to microglia ( combadiere et al . , ; harrison et al . , ; imai et al . , ) ."
"for example , in a model of excitotoxic brain injury induced by intracerebral injection of nmda in the rat , marked upregulation of ccr5 eression was observed by microglia and neurons ( galasso et al . , ) .","in brain from alzheimer ' s cases , plaque - associated reactive microglia also show increased ccr5 eression ."
"in view of their functional properties , increasing interest has focused on the possible involvement of chemokines in regulating cns leukocyte migration during viral infection .","however , as discussed below , studies of hiv - 1 have revealed that chemokine involvement in the pathogenesis of host - virus interactions extends well beyond leukocyte migration ."
"in the case of hiv , a vast amount of research effort focused on this virus led to the discovery of new chemokine receptors that proved to be critical for understanding the process of hiv - 1 entry into cells ( bleul et al . , ; feng et al . , ; oberlin et al . , ) .","the interactions between this virus and the host cns have also been studied extensively , and more recently the focus has turned to the chemokines and their receptors ."
"a seminal advance then came when it was shown that in addition to cd4 , cxcr4 was required for t - tropic hiv - 1 strains to infect host cells ( bleul et al . , ; feng et al . , ; oberlin et al . , ) .","a clue to the identity of other possible cofactors for hiv - 1 entry into cells came with the discovery that the chemokines mip - la , mip - i ~ , and rantes produced by c t cells could suppress hiv - 1 infection of cultured cells ( cocchi et al . , ) ."
"in its severest form , neuroaids can be responsible for subcortical dementia , memory impairment , and motor disorder .","although the neuropathology of neuroaids is often variable , typical features include formation of multinucleated giant cells , diffuse gliosis , myelin pallor , and increased blood - brain barrier permeability ."
"microglia have very low surface - eressed cd4 ( buttini et al . , ) and this may thus preclude the efficient use of cxcr4 as a coreceptor .","studies with primary cultures of human microglia have shown that ccr5 and ccr3 can serve as coreceptors with cd4 for hiv - 1 infection , while cxcr4 is relatively ineffective in this capacity ."
"moreover , he and colleagues demonstrated that yu2 and jrl env proteins that are cloned directly from hiv - l - infected brain use ccr5 or ccr3 , together with cd4 , for virus entry into transfected cells .","in support of this , hiv - 1 in the brain is typically m - tropic ( korber et al . , ; power et al . , ) ."
"in support of this idea , hiv - tat , protein - induced mcp - 1 eression by astrocytes can stimulate the transmigration of monocytes across an in vitro model of the human bbb ( weiss et al . , ) .","finally , since mip - la and rantes can effectively inhibit ccr5 coreceptor - mediated cell entry by hiv - 1 ( cocchi et al . , ; dragic et al . , ) , eression of these and other chemokines in the cns in neu - roaids might limit the spread of hiv - 1 by antagonizing infection of target microglia ."
"thus , the primary determinant of neurodegeneration may not be the m - tropic hiv forms constituting the major cns reservoir of hiv - 1 , but rather , it resides with blood - derived viruses that are prominent during later stages of disease .","analysis of a panel of diverse hiv - 1 primary isolates or strains revealed that , compared with blood - derived or t - tropic hiv - 1 isolates , brain - derived m - tropic hiv - 1 isolates are ineffective at inducing neuronal and astrocyte apoptosis ( ohagen et al . , ; zheng et al . , b ) ."
"since the effects of the virions could be blocked by antibodies to gpl20 and gp41 , the findings indicate that the envelope proteins in their native state are more potent mediators than their recombinant or purified derivatives .","in these studies , the purified t - tropic hivgpl20 protein proved to be far less effective in affecting neuronal signaling and cell death than the whole virions ."
"hiv gpl20 neuronal apoptosis can be inhibited by inhibitors of p38 mapk ( kaul and lipton , ) and by calcium / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase ii , protein kinase a , and protein kinase c ( zheng et al . , a ) , linking neuronal apoptosis , in part , to these signal transduction pathways .","these include inhibition of cyclic amp ; activation of phosphoinositol ( pi ) hydrolysis , which is partially prevented by antibody to cxcr4 ( zheng et al . , a ; zheng et al . , b ) ; activation of p38 mitogen - activated kinase ( p38 mapk ) ( kaul and lipton , ) ; and increased ca + mobilization ( meucci et al . , ) ."
"sdf - 1 is eressed constitutively in the adult cns predominantly by astrocytes and to a lesser degree by neurons , raising the likelihood that this chemokine may regulate physiological processes in the adult brain .","in support of this , sdf - la regulates a number of signal transduction pathways in neurons , causing decreased cyclic amp , increased pi hydrolysis , activation of p38mapk , and increased ca + mobilization ( kaul and lipton , ; meucci et al . , ; zheng et al . , a ) ."
"the host immune system plays a major role in the infection of the cns with siv , where perivascular macrophages are continuously replaced via recruitment from the circulating monocyte pool through the blood - brain barrier ( lane et al . , ) .","both t - tropic and m - tropic siv variants have been isolated and , like neuroaids , macrophage / microglia constitute the primary infected target cell population in the brain of siv - infected monkeys ."
"in addition to leukocyte and endothelial adhesion molecules , chemokines could be critical components involved in siv infection of the brain .","using immunohistochemical staining to investigate chemokine eression in the encephalitic brain of siv - infected macaques , sasseville and coworkers reported upregulation in the eression of a number of chemokines , including mip - la , mip - i ~ , rantes , mcp - 3 , and ip - 10 , by vascular endothelium and / or perivascular mononuclear cells ."
"thus , both the qualitative pattern of eression and the functional behavior of the chemokine receptors , ccr3 , ccr5 , and cxcr4 , in the two species are remarkably alike .","this idea is further underscored by a recent study in which chemokine receptor eression and signaling were examined in cultured neurons derived from either macaque or human brains ( klein et al . , ) ."
ms is thought to be an autoim - mune t - cell - mediated disease that is targeted at the myelin sheath .,"in humans , multiple sclerosis is the most common and the bestknown cns demyelinating disorder ."
ham / tsp patients have a high frequency of c ctl in their peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) .,"biddison and coworkers have shown that htlv - i - specific c ctl clones secrete mip - la , mip - i ~ , and il - 16 ( biddison et al . , ) ."
"the mechanisms of demyelination in this model are not clear , although there is a requirement for a competent immune response .","however , in surviving animals , further viral replication is controlled by the host response and a chronic mononuclear cell inflammation , which occurs in the brain and spinal cord , is linked to a progressive demyelinating disease ( buchmeier and lane , ; lane and buchmeier , ; weiner , ) ."
"with the exception of rantes , a similar pattern of chemokine eression was observed with cultured astrocytes infected with active , but not uv - inactive , mhv , indicating that viral replication in these cells can directly stimulate chemokine gene eression .","therefore , in mhv infection of the brain , early viral - induced chemokine gene eression by resident cns cells such as astrocytes might promote the recruitment of t lymphocytes and macrophages and contribute to the maintenance of the chronic inflammatory response leading to demyelination ."
"thus , mhvinfected cd4 ko mice have a marked reduction in the number of activated macrophage / microglia within their brains and spinal cords and significantly less demyelination .","concomitant with the reduction in cns inflammatory disease in the mhv - infected cd4 ko mice , lower levels of rantes , but not other chemokine transcripts and protein were found indicating that cd4 t - cells represent one major source of rantes in the cns during mhv encephalomyelitis ."
"eression of mip - i ~ and mip - i ~ protein was also detectable , being present in the spinal cord before the onset of disease and persisting throughout disease progression .","a study of the eression of cc and cxc chemokines in the cns throughout the disease course showed that eression of c10 , ip - 10 , mcp - 1 , mip - la , mip - i ~ , and rantes mrna transcripts overlapped with the development of disease ( hoffman et al . , ) ."
"meningoencephalitis represents one of the most devastating consequences of viral infection of the cns , in which a concerted immunoinflammatory response by the host produces severe injury to the brain , leading to debilitating neurological disease and often death .","in the viral meningoencephalitides , the specific mechanisms underlying the localization , extravasation , and activation of immune cells in the cns and the subsequent interactions between these cells are not well understood ."
"from asensio , v . c . , kincaid , c . , and campbell , i . l . chemokines and the inflammatory response to viral infection in the vall ~ rie c . asensio and iain l . campbell these observations , together with the finding that crg - 2 / ip - 10 , a prominently eressed chemokine gene in many different cns viral infections , is eressed by resident cns cells including astrocytes ( see fig .",") , suggest that activation ofchemokine gene eression may be a direct , early , and localized host response to lcmv infection ."
herpes simplex virus ( hsv ) is a common etiologic agent of acute focal encephalitis .,"pathologically , in hsv encephalitis , leukocytes infiltrate the subarachnoid space as a hallmark of meningitis and encephalitis , while csf analysis typically reveals a predominantly lymphocytic pleocytosis ."
"hsv stromal keratitis , associated with productive infection in the eye , results in significant accumulation of pmn , which may be driven by the presence in particular of the cxc chemokines gro - a and mip - 2 ( thomas et al . , ) .","eerimental studies of hsv - 1 in mice , following ocular infection , highlight the rapid and sustained upregulation of a number of chemokine genes including gro - a , mip - i ~ , mip - 2 , mcp - 1 , ip - 10 , and rantes ( carr et al . , ; thomas et al . , ) ."
this study clearly establishes a direct link between the cns eression of the chemokines ip - 10 and mcp - 1 and cns leukocytosis in viral meningitis .,mcp - 1 was identified as an important chemoattractant for pbmcs while the combination of mcp - 1 and ip - 10 was required for migration of activated t cells .
"while it is presently unknown whether these paramyviruses induce the eression of other chemokine genes , their potent ability to directly induce ip - 10 eression by glial cells may constitute a significant cns source of production of this chemokine during viral meningitis .","the promoter requirements for the induction of ip - 10 gene eression are similar for ifn - ~ and mv ; however , these two stimuli use different combinations of dna binding factors , with stat or nf ~ b being more important in the direct induction of ip - 10 by ifn - ~ or mv , respectively ."
"chemokine gene eression was investigated and prominent induction of ip - 10 was observed in the spleen and cns of susceptible mice , whereas mcp - 1 and mip - 2 , respectively , were found in the spleen and brain of resistant mice ( charles et al . , ) .","mouse adenovirus - type ( mav - 1 ) is a double - stranded dna virus that causes a fatal hemorrhagic encephalopathy in c57b1 / 6 mice within - 6 days ( guida et al . , ) , along with infection of cerebrovascular endothelial cells ."
this in turn will determine the qualitative makeup of the leukocytes recruited to the brain .,"it is important to note , however , that how a chemokine that is secreted by a parenchymally located glial cell is "" sensed "" by circulating peripheral leukocytes is unclear at this time ."
in many respects the cns possesses its own chemokine network permitting autocrine and paracrine regulation of cellular activity .,various classes of chemokine receptors are eressed by cns cells including neurons and the glia .
"moreover , the infectious cycle of btov under natural field conditions was established by compiling information from different studies ( hoet and saif , ) .","btov was first isolated in united states ( woode et al . , ) , but it has been later found in other countries such as canada ( duckmanton et al . , ) , japan ( ito et al . , ) , south korea ( park et al . , ) , austria ( haschek et al . , ) , united kingdom ( liebler et al . , ) , the netherlands ( koopmans et al . , ) , germany ( koop - mans et al . , ) , italy ( lavazza , ) and south africa ( vorster and gerdes , ) ."
in the present work both diagnostic methods have been used to carry out an epidemiological survey to establish the incidence and the dynamics of ptov infection in piglets from three spanish farms .,"recently , two new assays for ptov diagnosis have been reported : an enzyme - linked inmunosorbent assay ( elisa ) based on a recombinant ptov nucleocapsid protein ( pignatelli et al . , ) , to detect antibodies against ptov , and a realtime rt - pcr method to detect ptov viral rna in stool samples ( pignatelli et al . , ) ."
"equine dermal cells ( e . derm ) ( atcc ccl - 57 tm ) were kindly provided by r . j . de groot ( utrecht university , utrecht , the netherlands ) .","they were maintained in dulbecco ' s modified eagle ' s medium ( dmem ) supplemented with % foetal calf serum ( fcs ) , units per ml of penicillin , and mg / ml of streptomycin ."
"piglets were weaned at - 23 days of age and transferred to nursery units , where litters from different sows were mixed .","field samples including serum and stool samples were collected from three multi - site farms with all in - all out flow production system , located in north - eastern spain ."
"selected piglets ( n = , per farm , coming from different sows ; piglets per sow , being a total of females and males ) were ear - tagged at the st week of age and blood samples were collected from each piglet at , , , and weeks of age .",blood samples from the corresponding sows ( n = ) were also collected week post - farrowing .
neutralization titers were calculated using the spearman - k rber formula and serum samples with neutralizing antibody titers equal or higher than ( or in logarithmic scale ) were considered positive .,serum samples were tested by duplicated and negative ( spf ) and positive ( cps ) control sera were included in each test .
"nonetheless , a mixture of those serum samples were used as negative control , and were analyzed in parallel in each elisa plate , as well as a positive serum ( cps ) .","nm = 70 ) had been established previously using serum samples from cd / cd piglets that were tested in five independent eeriments performed in different days , and represented the mean value obtained plus three times the standard deviation ."
"besides , rna extraction , reverse transcription and real - time rt - pcr negative controls were analyzed in parallel with field samples in each plate to discard crosscontamination of samples .","all rna extraction procedures , cdna synthesis and real - time rt - pcr reactions were performed in independent rooms and in pcr hoods , using exclusive pipettes , filter tips and disposable aliquots of reagents and pcr grade water ."
"then , ml of the homogenate were centrifuged min at rpm , and ml of the resulting supernatant was used for rna isolation with a commercial kit ( high pure rna isolation kit , roche diagnostic s . l . , applied science , madrid , spain ) .",rna was recovered in ml and stored at c until use .
"real - time pcr was performed in all collected swabs using sybr green detection method and oligonucleotide primers rtnii5 and rtnii3 corresponding to the sequence coding for ptov - n protein , as previously described ( pignatelli et al . , ) .",for virus quantitation - fold dilutions of the t7 - n control cdna were analyzed in each eeriment .
"briefly , ml of cdna were added to a reaction mix containing high fidelity buffer , mm of each dntp , nm of each primer and 1 u / ml of platinum taq dna polymerase high fidelity ( invitrogen , life technologies corp , carlsbad , ca , usa ) .","thermal cycling conditions were as follows : cycle of c for min ; cycles of denaturation at c for s , annealing at c for s and elongation at c for min ."
"the amplified products obtained by real - time rt - pcr were isolated from the reaction mix using pcr isolation kit ( qiagen gmbh , hilden , germany ) and were directly sequenced using the rtnii3 primer .","for he gene sequen - cing , pcr amplified fragments were cloned into pgemt easy vector ( promega corp . , madison , wi , usa ) , and three independent clones obtained from each fragment were used for sequencing ."
"to group piglets by igg profiles , mev software was used ( mev version , tm4 software suit , dana - farber cancer institute , boston , ma , usa ) ( saeed et al . , ) .",a kmeans algorithm was used with euclidean distance metric and iterations .
"in that group , out of ( 34% ) underwent an igg rise detected at week , while in out of piglets ( 30% ) a second igg rise was observed at week .",one group ( profile ) corresponded to piglets that showed a significant igg increase by weeks of age ( 44% of piglets ) .
"in farm c , % of piglets showed an immune response characteristic of profile , but in % and % of animals the rise in igg levels occurred at weeks and , respectively ( profiles and ) , and % of piglets did not show a noticeable humoral immune response ( profile ) .","in farm b , almost half of the piglets developed antibodies at week ( 47% ) ( profile ) , % at week ( profile ) and % at week ( profile ) , but only a % did not show high igg levels at any time point ( profile ) ."
"piglet from farm b and piglets , , , , and from farm c ) were analyzed .","selected piglets represented igg profiles , and ( 3 piglets per profile ) ."
"at week , neutralizing titers decreased slightly or were kept similar , even in piglets from profile that had shown a high igg increase by elisa at that time ( fig .",", profile ) were positive , but neutralizing antibody titers decreased in all animals ."
seventy - five out of samples ( 42% ) were positive for ptov rna .,"in piglets ( 92% ) , ptov was detected in stools table comparative serological analysis by elisa and virus neutralization assay ( nt ) of nine selected piglets at different weeks of age and their corresponding sows ."
"as determined by titration using rna standard curve , low virus loads were observed in most samples .","however , some samples contained up to to copies of viral rna suggesting that the corresponding piglets were shedding high amounts of ptov virus at the time of sampling ."
"to confirm the specificity of the fragments obtained by rt - pcr , pcr products from randomly selected animals ( 13 samples from farm a , from farm b and from farm c ) were purified and used directly for sequencing .",all sequenced fragments were related with sequences previously described from other ptov strains and clustered in five groups ( fig .
the obtained sequence showed that the he gene was partially deleted in this sample and only nucleotides from the he - end were conserved .,that region was fused to the canonical transcription - regulating signal ( trs ) sequence located at the - end of the gene .
"ptov is broadly dispersed around europe ( kroneman et al . , ; matiz et al . , ; smits et al . , ) and has also been detected in canada ( durham et al . , ) and south africa ( penrith and gerdes , ) .","however , to date , there is little information available about ptov epidemiology ."
"unfortunately , faecal samples from sows were not available and , thus , the virus loads in those animals could not be determined .",a potential elanation for the higher rate of infection in farm a could be that sows from this farm shed higher amounts of virus than those from other farms .
neutralization and elisa ( or western - blot ) tests were observed at such age .,"this observation could also be related to the different antigens used in the two assays ( wang et al . , ) and / or to the different neutralizing or anti - n antibody levels present in maternal colostrum ."
"on the other hand , animals assigned to profile were those that did not develop a detectable humoral immune response , at least during the studied period .","profiles , and corresponded to animals in which a significant rise of the igg response was observed at weeks , and , respectively ."
"interestingly , piglets from profile developed high levels of antibodies against the n protein at week , as determined by elisa and also by western - blot ( data not shown ) , but not neutralizing antibodies .",this observation would reflect an early antibody development after a first contact with the virus that was not evidenced by the neutralizing test .
"these findings would indicate a lack of correlation between serum igg and mucosal protection ( koopmans et al . , ) .","in torovirus , impairment of mucosal immune response has been attributed to infection by these viruses of dome m cells woode et al . , ) , which play an important role in local immunity ."
"as mentioned before , a possible elanation for these results could be that sows from farm a might spread higher amounts of virus to their offspring than those from farms b and c . this would indicate that the degree of eure to the virus during the first week of piglet ' s life would influence the development of the immune response against the virus .","the infection in the presence of maternal antibodies may decrease or delay the development of an active immune response in piglets , as it seems to occur in animals showing an igg profile of type ."
"these observations suggest that at least two different ptov strains were circulating simultaneously in these farms , and individual animals could be infected by these two strains during their productive life .","on the other hand , in farm b and , probably , farm c , a second ptov strain was infecting piglets around weeks of age , as it could be concluded from the sequence analysis from the n gene fragment and the he complete gene from four animals ."
"this result could indicate immunological differences between he lineages , as it has been shown to occur in the case of btov , where two different he lineages have been defined and antigenic differences observed ( smits et al . , ) .","however , there is little information about torovirus he functions and its antigenic properties and , thus , further studies would be required to understand these issues ."
"however , the link between ptov and disease remains unclear yet and more extensive studies are needed to establish the role of ptov as a gastroenteritis causing agent .","btov has been reported to cause gastroenteritis in gnobiotic calves under eerimental conditions ( woode et al . , ; pohlenz et al . , ) and under natural infections ( brown et al . , ) , by itself or in combination with other pathogens ( weiss et al . , ; hoet et al . , hoet et al . , , ."
"adenovirus was detected in ( 9.6% ) samples , coronaviruses in ( 9.1% ) , metapneumovirus in ( 5.3% ) and parainfluenzae in ( 4.9% ) .",rhinovirus ( 40% ) was the most prevalent pathogen in upper respiratory tract infections while respiratory syncytial virus ( 49.9% ) was the most prevalent in lower respiratory tract infections .
acute respiratory infections ( aris ) are more prevalent than any other form of infectious disease in children .,they range from mild upper respiratory tract problems to serious lower respiratory infections such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia .
"the use of multiplex assays should significantly reduce hands - on time and cost , and rapidly provide reliable results .",the multiplex ligation - dependent probe amplification technology ( mpla ) - respifinder respiratory assay recently became commercially available .
all the samples taken from - 6532 / elsevier b . v . all rights reserved .,this prospective study was done to evaluate this multiplex technique for use in clinical diagnosis .
whether or not a child had been vaccinated against influenza was also recorded .,"paediatricians completed a specific questionnaire related to the symptoms , including fever and upper respiratory manifestations ( rhinitis , pharyngitis , otitis , sore throat , cough ) and presence of symptoms of lower respiratory infections ( bronchiolitis , pneumonia , acute flu and flu syndrome ) ."
the test also includes a probe for detecting the avian influenza virus a h5n1 .,"this assay can detect viruses : influenza viruses ( iv ) types a and b , parainfluenza viruses to ( piv ) , respiratory syncytial viruses a and b ( rsv ) , rhinovirus ( rv ) , coronaviruses e , oc43 and nl63 ( cov ) , human metapneumovirus ( mpv ) and adenovirus ( adv ) ."
"the mean age was years and the median age was months [ range : - 186 ] , but / 914 ( 62.6% ) children were under year old .","a total of children , of whom / 914 ( 55.7% ) were male were enrolled in the study between october , and march , and provided samples ."
"children ( 723 samples ) suffered from lower respiratory infections defined as bronchiolitis ( 338 / 914 ; %) , pneumonia or bronchopneumonia ( 109 / 914 ; %) , acute asthma ( 78 / 914 ; %) and flu or flu - like syndrome ( 158 / 914 ; %) .","the children in the study group included / 914 ( 25.4% ) with upper respiratory tract infections ( 243 samples ) defined as rhino - pharyngitis or sore throat , with or without otitis media ."

"adv , mpv and cov were most frequently detected during the winter months , although piv was detected throughout the study .","iva was predominant until week of , while ivb was the most prevalent thereafter , decreasing slowly until the end of march ."
we collected respiratory samples from a group of children suffering from acute respiratory infections and the results obtained were analyzed in comparison to the clinical manifestations .,the spread of the viruses was also analyzed during this winter period .
"these results are similar to those for young children and infants obtained by others ( 88 - 92% ) , whereas the rate of detection in adults was lower ( 43% ) .","a very high percentage of the samples were positive giving a virus signature in nearly % of cases , and all the viruses in the test panel were detected ."
flu and flu syndromes were preferentially linked to influenza viruses and older children seemed to be more susceptible to these viruses .,"we found a relationship between an influenza virus infection and severe infection due to hyperthermia , but not with more severe respiratory symptoms , in contrast to the situation in adults ."
rsv and iv were epidemic while the frequency of the other viruses changed little .,we also analyzed the way viral infections spread during the winter .
the results for viral pathogens can be obtained in about one day .,"it is also much simpler than conventional routine techniques , which need many and various steps and a wide range of technical competence ( culture , pcr , immunofluorescence ) ."
"the mlpa - respifinder assay revealed that a high percentage of samples from children attending the emergency unit with aris during the autumn and winter of / 2 0 1 1 contained at least one virus , and that co - infections were very common .","rsv and rv were the most prevalent pathogens , particularly in the youngest children , and co - infections were associated with more severe respiratory symptoms ."
"in this study , efficiency of several pcr assays designed for cfphv detection is elored and compared to a method published previously .","the results show that adoption of a triplet set of singleplex pcr assays outperforms other methods , with an approximately - fold increase in detection success in comparison to the standard assay ."
"previous studies have detected the presence of cfphv dna in fibropapilloma tumour biopsies , and viral dna sequences were also recovered recently from normal tissue from fibropapillomatosis exhibiting animals ( ene et al . , ; page - karjian et al . , ) .","the detection of cfphv in tumour biopsies is not surprising - herpesviruses are known to replicate in tumours and tissue of debilitated animals , thus large concentrations of viral dna are present ."
"singleplex pcr assays targeting relatively short amplicons ( short - range pcr ) are among those used most commonly , and have been reported to be more sensitive for viral detection than real - time pcr assays , for example as proven in detecting white spot syndrome virus ( wssv ) ( mrotzek et al . , ) , infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus ( ihhnv ) ( katzourakis and gifford , ) and monodon baculovirus ( mbv ) in shrimp ( mrotzek et al . , ) ; porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ( prrsv ) ; transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( tgev ) , porcine respiratory coronavirus ( pcrv ) and pseudorabies virus ( prv ) in pigs ( braun and chase , ; minarovits et al . , ; chentoufi et al . , ) and various human papillomaviruses ( kleter et al . , ; morshed et al . , ) .","in addition to conventional pcr , nested pcr assays have also been employed , following results suggest that they may increase detection sensitivity by , 000 - fold ( fox et al . , ; klein et al . , ; lu et al . , lu et al . , , quackenbush et al . , ) ."
"the assays include ( i ) a nested - pcr based assay published previously , - 0934 / elsevier b . v . all rights reserved .","( ii ) a nested pcr - based approach designed here to target short segments of three genes of the cfphv , and ( iii ) three new singleplex pcr primer sets targeting the same three viral genes ."
"in review , supplementary data s2 ) were used to cross - compare the performance of several new pcr - based assays designed to detect cfphv .",these samples represent both active ( fp tumour ) and latent ( non - tumour ) cfphv infections .
initially a primary pcr using l of dna extract was pcr amplified for cycles .,"these products were purified using the qiaquick pcr purification kit ( qiagen , usa ) following the instructions of the manufacturer , of which l was used as template for secondary ( nested ) pcr ."
"both outperformed the control - nested assay lu . et . ul30 , which detected viral sequences in only % of the cases as shown in table and in detail per each dna extract in supplementary table s1 .","when viewed as a set , the singleplex assay detected virus in % of the extracts , in comparison to only % of samples using the nested assays ."
", who applied originally this to a hawaiian green turtle fibropapillomatosis test population .","subsequently it has been applied for detection of cfphv in greens and loggerheads turtles from florida and in two green turtle populations in puerto rico ( page - karjian et al . , ) , with success rates that were higher over a mixture of tumour and non - tumour samples than reported here ."
it is hypothesized that precision of detection may be correlated to the initial viral dna concentration and dna fragment sizes available in the sample ; as well as the pcr chemistry to anneal to the targeted viral dna .,the potential role of viral concentration in pcr success is obvious .
"thus , the validated method described will make possible to map out the occurrence of clinically and latent cfphv infected turtles .","as such , the method is likely to represent a competitive alternative to previous detection methods ."
"this virus exists in a wide range of genetically and antigenically distinct types , making the prevention and control of this pathogen very challenging .","while it is believed that the natural host of ibv is the chicken , the presence of ibv - like and other avian coronaviruses has been reported in both domestic and wide birds ( cavanagh , ( cavanagh , , , making the epidemiology and mechanisms of infection very complex ."
"the s1 protein is also the major inducer of neutralizing and serotype - specific antibodies and thus plays an important role in protective immunity ( wickramasinghe et al . , ) .","the s1 subunit of s protein carries the receptor binding site and thus plays an important role in tissue tropism ( belouzard et al . , ) ."
"furthermore , new genotypes of ibv and associated variants appear frequently in different parts of the world ; these have arisen because of mutations , especially in the s1 subunit , including point mutations , insertions , deletions , and also recombination between different ibv strains ( cavanagh et al . , ; jackwood et al . , ) .","currently , at least different antigenic and genetic types of ibv that are poorly cross - protective have been discovered and studied by virus - neutralization tests and molecular characterization of the s1 protein gene ( de wit et al . , a ( de wit et al . , , b jackwood et al . , ) ."
"surveillance studies have reported widespread ibv infections in china since the late s with associated multiple types ; lx4 ( qx - like ) is the predominant type circulating in chicken flocks and first emerged in and at least five other serotypes gao et al . , ; han et al . , ; liu et al . , ) and variants liu et al . , liu et al . , , ma et al . , ) have been circulating in china over recent years .","ibv was recorded in china for the first time in the s ( han et al . , ) ."
"three ibv viruses , cov / ck / china / i0111 / 14 , cov / ck / china / i0114 / 14 and cov / ck / china / i0118 / 14 , were isolated in guangxi province from local yellow feature chickens which showed respiratory signs at - , - and - days - old , respectively .","the flock where the cov / ck / china / i0118 / 14 was isolated from was located in liuzhou , and the other two flocks where the cov / ck / china / i0111 / 14 and cov / ck / china / i0114 / 14 viruses were isolated were located in guilin ."
strains / 91 and h120 are ib vaccines commonly used in china .,all of these viruses were propagated in - day - old embryonated spf eggs and viral titer was determined as mentioned above .
s1 genes from reference ibv strains were selected and used for phylogenetic analysis with those of our three strains .,amplified pcr products were sequenced directly using sense and antisense primers and sequences were first analyzed with blastn ( blastn : ) .
"( http / ) by comparison with a reference , the complete genome of the beaudette strain published in genbank .",the identities of complete genomic sequences between our three isolates were compared and calculated and then blastn was conducted using the complete genomic sequence of isolate cov / ck / china / i0111 / .
twelve fragments were obtained based upon the results of multiple sequence alignment constructed with mafft v6 and simplot .,"to further study the relationship between our three ibv isolates , we created a similarity plot ( simplot ) using a bp window with a bp step with the isolate cov / ck / china / i0111 / 14 as the query strain ."
"the complete genomic sequences of cov / ck / china / i0111 / 14 , cov / ck / china / i0114 / 14 and cov / ck / china / i0118 / 14 have been deposited in the genbank database with the accession numbers ky407557 , ky407556 and ky407558 , respectively .","to confirm recombination breakpoints , pairwise comparisons of the complete genomic sequence of cov / ck / china / i0111 / 14 were performed with those of gx - yl5 and / 91 strains according to the results of phylogenetic analysis ."
"blast homology searches , using both the s1 and s amino acid sequences of isolate cov / ck / china / i0111 / 14 , revealed that gx - yl5 was most similar to cov / ck / china / i0111 / 14 , although limited overall sequence identity was observed ( 89.0% and %, respectively ) .","these results indicated that our three isolates exhibit unique characteristics , both in s1 and s genes ."
"a three - nucleotide deletion was identified between the sequences of the m and a genes in cov / ck / china / i0111 / 14 , by comparing with those of isolates cov / ck / china / i0114 / 14 and cov / ck / china / i0118 / 14 .",the complete genome sequences of the three ibv strains showed a typical ibv gene order of utr - 1 a - 1 b - s - 3 a - 3 b - e - m - 5 a - 5 b - n - 3 utr and shared high genetic identities with each other (> %); gene lengths are shown in table .
"based upon the titers calculated from cross virus - neutralization tests in embryonating eggs , gi - 29 was antigenically distinct from not only the vaccine strains but all the circulating serotypes obtained in this study ( table ) .",this implies that gi - 29 was antigenically different from those strains in this study and represents a different serotype .
"however , mild to moderate respiratory signs , such as head shaking and occasionally , open mouth breathing , were observed between and days in chickens challenged with cov / ck / china / i0111 / 14 .",no obvious clinical signs were observed and no birds died during eeriments in the control group .
"at days after challenge , no obvious gross lesions were observed in the kidneys of the surviving chickens .","meanwhile , no ihc - positive cells were found in the kidneys of these chickens ."
"however , in some cases , highly similar strains show only limited cross - protection , while a high level of cross - protection may exist for strains with a much lower homology ( de wit et al . , a ( de wit et al . , , b .","there was a correlation between the genotype ( amino acid sequence identity ) , serotype and immunotype / protectotype ( the level of crossprotection ) ; ibv strains within the same serotype usually share more than % amino acid similarity in s1 and belong to the same immunotype ( cavanagh , ) , whereas different ibv serotypes share less than % amino acid similarity ( cavanagh , ) ."
"alternatively , it is also likely that some gene fragments are exchanged between viruses through recombination .","although we cannot conclude that recombination events have occurred in most parts of the genomes , we can point to the evolutionary trends in the regions of gi - 29 viral genomes as compared to the evolutionary trends in the replicase gene of the reference strains ."
the gi - 29 type of ibv in this study was isolated from chickens vaccinated twice with h120 vaccine .,these viruses are likely able to evade h120 induced immune response based on the results of the current study .
these findings suggest that genetically diverse korean ptov strains cause sporadic infections in korea .,"phylogenetic analysis of the spike and nucleocapsid genes showed that the korean ptovs form distinct branches with clusters corresponding to the farm of origin , which were separate from the other known foreign ptovs ."
"since then , toroviruses have been detected in normal horses and also in humans , pigs , and turkeys with diarrhea .",bovine torovirus ( btov or breda virus ) was first detected in in the united states during an outbreak of neonatal calf diarrhea in which % of the affected animals died .
"moreover , sequence data for ptov strains are limited to the s , m , he , and n genes and have been reported only in european countries , including the netherlands , italy , and hungary .","despite the impact of ptovs as enteric pathogens , there is a paucity of sequence and phylogenetic data on the ptov genes ."
"rna was extracted from a ll starting volume of the centrifuged % fecal suspensions using trizol - ls ( invitrogen , usa ) .",the total rna recovered was suspended in ll of rnase - free water and stored at c .
"using the dna basic module ( dnasis max , alameda , ca ) , the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the partial and full - length s gene and the m , he and n genes were compared with those selected from other known toroviruses ( supplementary table ) .","bootstrap tests ( 1,000 replicates ) of the phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide alignments without the primer sequences were carried out employing the neighbor - joining method and the kimura - parameter model using the molecular evolutionary genetics analysis program ( mega version ) with pairwise distances ."
"among the samples , only five tested positive for ptov alone , while the remaining samples were also positive for other enteric pathogens including prv a - c , psav , and salmonella spp ( data not shown ) .","this result indicates that the prevalence of ptov infections on korean pig farms is sporadic , similar to btov infections ( 6.9% ) on cattle farms in korea ."
a phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequence of the full - length m gene showed that all ptov strains belonged to the porcine ptov lineage ( fig .,the sequence identities of all korean ptov strains were relatively high within each farm .
molecular characterization of ptovs in korea is needed for vaccine development efforts and evaluation and also for clarifying the ecology and evolution of ptov .,sequence data on the ptov genes from many different countries would provide the fundamental data necessary for the development of more sensitive and specific diagnostic tools that could be used to determine the worldwide distribution of this virus .
"in contrast , a decrease in h5n1 ha activation ph has been shown to enhance replication and airborne transmission in mammals .","recently , efficient replication of highly pathogenic avian influenza ( hpai ) viruses such as h5n1 in avian species has been associated with a relatively high ha activation ph ."
the influenza a viruses are negative - strand rna viruses of the orthomyviridae family .,"they encode a variety of proteins from eight gene segments ( shaw and palese ) : pb2 , pb1 , pa , ha , np , na , m , and ns ."
"avian influenza viruses occasionally infect non - avian species including humans , causing limited outbreaks or global pandemics ( russell and webster ) .","the replication efficiency , transmissibility , and pathogenicity of a given influenza virus in a particular host depend on multiple viral and host factors ( salomon and webster ; belser et al ."
"many other enveloped viruses invade host cells similarly including hepatitis c virus , epstein - barr virus , vesicular stomatitis virus , avian leukemia virus , human rhinovirus , dengue virus , and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) coronavirus ( grove and marsh ) .","influenza viruses are internalized by endocytosis , and the ha protein is activated for membrane fusion by low ph ."
"disruption of viral / host - cyclophilin interactions either abolishes or severely impairs cellular infection , consistent with studies that suggest cyclophilins play multiple roles in viral pathogenesis .","such roles include stabilizing proteins involved in viral replication , and protecting proteins from cellular restriction factors ."
"to begin addressing the role of this first identified virally encoded cyclophilin during the lifecycle of the mimivirus and possibly gain insight into the roles of cyclophilins in viral infection in general , we have characterized mimicyp biochemically , structurally , and in vivo .","our most striking finding is that mimicyp is located on the surface of mature mimivirus virions as revealed by immunofluorescence studies , supporting reports that host cell hcypa is recruited by both hiv - 1 , and sars to viral membranes ."
"of particular interest is the absence of the highly conserved arginine residue that has been implicated in catalysis by nmr , x - ray crystallography , and activity studies ( figure ( a ) ) .","asn83 in mimicyp has replaced this catalytic residue ( arg55 in hcypa , arg63 in hcypb , and arg57 in ehcyp ) , suggesting a complete lack of ppiase activity probed further below or a different enzyme mechanism relative to other cyclophilins ."
the c - terminal residues - 234 that do not give rise to observable density are shown as dotted lines .,( c ) overlay of mimicyp ( blue ) with hcypa ( gold ) using all backbone nuclei of secondary structure elements ( 74 residues within each protein ) results in an rmsd of 2 .
much of the first two insertions do not give rise to observable electron density in the current crystal that includes residues - 71 .,the latter region is adjacent to the short conserved - helix ( figure ( c ) ) .
"for example , nmr spectra of mimicyp concentrated in the presence of csa were identical to that in the absence of the inhibitor , indicating no binding ( data not shown ) .","this is in contrast to the nmr spectra of csa / hcypa that is markedly different than hcypa alone , as observed by both others and us ."
crystals of mimicyp have the space group p2 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit .,generating the unit cell reveals molecules arranged as four trimers .
"like the predominantly electrostatic interactions observed between subunits within the trimer , interactions between trimers are also dominated by electrostatic interactions .",such trimer - trimer interactions occur on the face of the protein opposite the putative active site ( figure ( a ) ) .
"specifically , unlike all other observed cyclophilin active sites that allow for the binding of a wide array of prolinecontaining peptides and proteins , the active site of mimicyp suggests that it will not preferentially accommodate proline residues .","this conclusion is drawn from the acidic nature of the putative mimicyp active site , whereas most other cyclophilin active sites are hydrophobic and somewhat basic in nature ."
the directionality of this intermolecular bound loop within mimicyp is in an orientation opposite to that observed for known cyclophilin complexes ( figure ( e ) ) .,"as described above , the inserted loop forms a - turn , which results in a less extended insertion relative to either the hiv - 1 capsid loop bound to hcypa as well as smaller bound peptide substrates ."
"moreover , these resonances exhibit severe line - broadening , suggesting a dynamic equilibrium between monomer and higher - order oligomers was still present in solution and that arginine served to shift this equilibrium more towards the monomeric state .","however , even in the presence of arginine , only a subset of the resonances was visible ."
"however , both spectra derived from these mutant forms remain line - broadened , presumably due to the presence of the other oligomeric interaction .","similarly , truncating the c - terminal residues of mimicyp also resulted in a mutant protein that in solution has its equilibrium shifted towards a smaller oligomeric state ( figure ( c ) ) ."
sharp amide resonances observed in the center of the spectrum for the wildtype mimicyp also appear in the spectrum of - 194 ( figure ( a ) and ( b ) ) but not in the spectrum of - 234 ( figure ( c ) ) .,"additionally , a comparison of these h - 15 n trosy - hsqc spectra supports our hypthesis that the c - terminal residues unobserved within the x - ray crystal structure ( residues - 234 ) are disordered in solution ."
"in contrast to hcypa , in the presence of equal concentrations of mimicyp , two separate sets of resonances remain for suc - afpf - pna and neither exhibit any apparent line - broadening ( figure ( c ) ) .","consequently , a single set of averaged resonances is observed ( figure ( b ) ) ."
"both western blots and silver staining lend further evidence that the antigen recognized in mimivirus extracts is recombinant mimicyp , since both proteins migrate with the same molecular weight ( figure ( b ) ) .","the other proteins recognized by the antibodies represent a very small fraction of the total proteins , since they are not visible upon silver staining sds - page gels ( figure ( c ) ) and may be proteolyzed and larger mimicyp aggregates ( possibly cross - linked through disulfide bridges over time ) ."
this is consistent with recent findings where viral factories form just hours after infection and viral particles are visible throughout the entire cytoplasm .,"fluorescence eeriments using anti - mimicyp antibodies clearly show this cyclophilin is highly eressed during infection ( figure ( b ) and ( c ) , green ) as well as within intact virions released from the cells ( figure ( d ) ) ."
"since csa is not eected to bind mimicyp , it was also not eected to block infection , as is the case for hiv - 1 where it targets hcypa .","however , neither the inhibitor nor the presence of the proteins had any apparent change to the mimivirus life cycle ( 16 h post infection ) ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the mimicyp is either not critical for infection of a . polyphaga or that the high levels of eression detected during infection could not be suppressed ( figure ( b ) and ( c ) ) ."
"this is especially intri - guing considering peptidyl - prolyl isomerization mediated by host cyclophilins has been suggested to play a role in viral infection , and the hiv - 1 capsid is isomerized by hcypa .","in contrast , these data suggest that ppiase activity of mimicyp is not utilized during viral infection by the mimivirus , although we cannot rule out an evolutionarily distinct catalytic function of mimicyp relative to the role that host cell cyclophilins play in other viral infections ."
"a major distinction is that the potential catalytic residue , asn83 , lies much further away from this loop relative to the conserved arg55 in hcypa to its substrates .",the basic loop of residues - 194 from a neighboring monomer that inserts into the putative active site partially overlaps with other cyclophilin - binding partners ( figure ( e ) ) .
"thus , mimicyp self - association may also serve as a regulatory means of blocking ( or eing ) a ligand - binding site ( or substrate - binding site ) in a concentration dependent manner .",we have also shown that mimicyp exists in an equilibrium between its monomer and higher order oligomers and that this equilibrium can be shifted towards the monomeric state by either high ionic strength or mutagenesis ( figure ) .
millimolar ) and many parasitic cyclophilins bind csa with such weak affinity as well .,"for example , the human n - terminal region of natural killer triggering receptor ( nk - tr ) contains a cyclophilin domain with a very weak affinity for csa ( i . e ."
"however , eerimental confirmation awaits the functional and biochemical characterization of these proteins .","like mimicyp , several of these have been found to oligomerize , both upon crystallization and in solution , and several recently identified cyclophilins may not engage csa or catalyze peptidyl - prolyl interconversion ."
"the most striking finding of this study is that mimicyp is localized on the surface of mature mimivirus virions , as evidenced by immunofluorescence ( figure ( d ) ) .","since the mimivirus is an icosahedral virus incased by its capsid protein d13l ( geneid : , hereinafter called mimicapsid ) , , 18 our results suggest a direct interaction between mimicapsid and mimicyp ."
"thus , the mimivirus may utilize its virally encoded mimicyp for similar functions .","for example , mimicyp neutralization of the acidic mimicapsid may block electrostatic repulsion between the virus and the target cell , thereby promoting cellular adhesion and allowing for viral entry ."
"fourth , mimicyp eression during infection may be too high to specifically block by the addition of recombinant protein or antibodies ( figure ( b ) ) .","for owl monkeys , a chimeric protein is formed between trim5a and cyclophilin - a , called trimcyp , and binds the hiv - 1 capsid resulting in ubiquitin - mediated protein degradation ."
"this is further supported by findings within other viruses , such as vsv and hepatitis c , that rely on host cell cyclophilins for transcription and translation , respectively .",", interestingly , viral factories have recently been identified within the mimivirus infected amoebal hosts within only several hours post infection and such hot spots of viral replication have also been identified during vv infection where host cell hcypa is utilized ."
the mimivirus is the first identified virus that encodes for its own cyclophilin that we have characterized here .,"the mimicyp is significantly different than other cyclophilin family members and , thus , may prove a novel therapeutic target for virally induced pneumonia ."
"the cleaved pet15b vector and pcr product were ligated , resulting in the vector pet15bmimicyp .",the forward primer contained an overhang with the ndei restriction site ( 5 - ctccgtcatatgaattatt - cattggaagatttacc - 3 ) and the reverse primer with the bamhi restriction site ( 5 - ggccatggatcctcaat - taactctggtagg - 3 ) .

what are the ecological conditions that increase the probability of emergence ?,how does an increase in cross - species eure affect the probability of an evolutionary host switch by h5n1 ?
the combined perspectives of evolutionary ecology and social ecology can provide a basis for associating qualitative levels of risk with quantifiable factors from pathogen mutation rate to patterns of land use change .,"evolutionary ecology focuses on how interaction between phenotype and environment generates differences in darwinian fitness among different phenotypes ( pianka , ) ."
"in enzootics , such as h5n1 , where the ecological conditions appear to be in place for emergence , yet barriers to crossspecies transmission exist , we must combine both the social - ecological context and evolutionary potential ( mutation , genetic drift , recombination , and adaptation due to natural selection ) of the pathogen to begin to quantify the risk of emergence .","more recently , it has been recognized that ecological factors which increase transmission also increase ongoing opportunities for adaptive evolution in the pathogen ( antia et al . , ; woolhouse et al . , ) , can increase r and , thus , affect the probability of disease emergence or reemergence ."
"furthermore , as members of complex and dynamic natural host communities ( a ' ' coupled human - natural system ' ' ) , humans are eed to infectious diseases from each other or other animals .","this process depends on social and ecological factors such as regional environmental change or cultural practices affecting landscapes , communities , through to population density ( morse , ; daszak et al . , daszak et al . , , smolinski et al . , ; morens et al . , ; weiss and mcmichael , ; wilcox and colwell , ; wilcox and gubler , ) ."
"the causal chain of emergence for h5n1 influenza a , or any enzootic pathogen , consists of a series of events that may potentially lead to a pandemic , where each key factor has sources of uncertainty in the largely stochastic nature of eure , infection , and transmission , and in a lack of empirical data .","epidemic or pandemic disease emergence in a novel host species , here referred to as the recipient for cross - species infection by spill - over from a donor host species , involves four phases : ) initial eure of the potential hosts ; ) subsequent cross - species infection ( e . g . , determined by degree of host specificity ) ; ) onward transmission of the novel pathogen within the focal population , where r > ( antia et al . , ; woolhouse et al . , ; kuiken et al . , ) ; and ) spread of disease between host populations ( anderson and may , ) ."
"increasing human population density directly increases r and as density exceeds a threshold ( n t ) , r becomes greater than and pathogen invasion and persistence is facilitated ( anderson et al . , ) .",several ecological factors concomitantly affect the eure rates of hosts ( phase ) and the evolutionary likelihood of a host switch ( phases and ) via changes to pathogen r .
"conditions that may be exacerbated by changes in other physical factors in the environment including long - term changes in climate , associated rainfall patterns and temperature change affecting the environ - mental persistence of ai , host ecology , etc .","successful onward transmission of highly pathogenic strains of ai appear to only occur in dense populations of domestic recipient avian species ( e . g . , ducks ) in very crowded conditions ( e . g . , wetmarkets , factory farms , and large free - grazing flocks ; gilbert et al . , ) ."
"many zoonoses , because they are host - specific to some degree , characteristically have a low cross - species reproductive rate ( r donor - recipient ) , with an even lower effective recipient - recipient r ( antia et al . , ) in the absence of ecological or evolutionary changes .",increases in recipient - recipient r to > can arise either ' ' coincidentally ' ' or due to evolution in the donor host for specificity .
"some of the evolutionary changes in h5n1 in specificity , replication efficiency , and / or immune evasion , necessary for efficient ongoing human - human transmission and pandemic emergence , are occurring and are sensitive to ecologic dynamics .","although to emerge as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality , infectious diseases need not necessarily undergo adaptation , it is the missing link in the emergence of ai ."
"ecotonal - level changes resulting from large - scale land - use conversion from wetlands to rice - cultivation or dryland forests to farming are also associated with disease emergence ( despommier et al . , ) .","the increasing movement of humans and animals enabled by modernized transportation systems both locally from village to town and city , as well as internationally through cheap and easily accessible air travel has further increased the spatial and temporal scope of human eure to people and livestock infected with hpai and other infectious diseases and could well increase subsequent spread of h5n1 to novel hosts as it did in the sars epidemic ( kan et al . , ) ."
"thus , the spatial and temporal patterns of social ecological changes that increase the potential for overlap of wild reservoir hosts ( the donor species ) , human - associated species , and humans ( the recipient species ) , may be amenable to analysis even in the absence of specific pathogen identification .","for example , trends in changing human demographics , land use , and densities and distributions of known domestic and peri - domestic host species characteristic of particular geographic areas are relatively predictable within a short historical time frame ( kaimowitz and angelsen , ; lambin et al . , ) and can be measured with geospatial information systems ( including maps and satellite information ) , census data , and agricultural , trade and policy analyses , to predict geographic hotspots of disease emergence ."
"linking the largely , stochastically driven , evolutionary dynamics of potential eids with the more deterministic , larger - scale changes in human ecology via the mechanism of host population size and interspecific interactions , points the way toward understanding the risk of a zoonosis becoming the next pandemic .","an interaction between individual donor species , their pathogens , and a novel recipient host must occur for novel disease emergence to occur ."
"this may be considered to include acquired or native immunity to a pathogen , although human immunocompetence varies with the health of an individual in spite of immune status .","we have , so far , ignored population health status and any human genetic variation that could affect susceptibility , which ultimately may be a critical factor in disease emergence ."
the very places and populations in which the emergence and resurgence of infectious diseases are first noticed are often where there is rapid and generally unplanned economic development and intensification of human activities .,"more generally , it is likely that population health status , including infectious disease or parasite load , is intimately related to the same social ecological factors associated with rapidly changing land use and livelihood patterns ."
"the paradigm in vogue suggests a four - step approach to risk assessment : hazard identification , eure assessment , dose - response analysis , and risk characterization ( goldstein , ) .","risk assessment in a human health context is defined as the systematic , scientific characterization of potential adverse effects of human or ecological eures to hazardous agents or activities ( nrc , ) ."
"this makes the three data - driven steps , hazard identification , eure assessment , and dose - response analysis not only subject to the increased difficulty of measurement ( epistemic error ) but also to inherent stochasticity ( aleatory error ; hilborn and mangel , ) .","however , risk characterization involving living hazards such as emergent pathogens is problematical because of the discussed uncertainties in ecological and evolutionary systems ."
"during this process , vaccinia virus , which shares broad antigenic properties with the variola virus , played an essential role as an effective vaccine in inducing protective immunity against smallpox .",it is well accepted that vaccine - induced neutralizing antibodies are critical to protection .
"genetic analysis of vtt genome , however , suggested that it is a vaccinia strain instead of a variola viral variant .",the clinical safety of this vaccine has not been clearly documented although vtt was historically used for millions of people .
"since s is not eressed on the surface of vaccinia virus , we aimed to determine the role of anti - vtt neutralizing antibody ( nab ) responses in achieving protection by evaluating the seroconversion to s . our results have implications for understanding an aspect of vaccinia - induced protective immunity and for developing vaccinia - based vaccines .","this study involved a safe , nonpathogenic viral challenge model using a high dose of modified vtt , namely , mvtt - s , which eresses the spike ( s ) glycoprotein of sars - cov ."
"each subgroup of three mice was challenged with a dose of pfu mvtt - s through one of three different routes including i . m . , i . n . , and i . o . , respectively .","after six months of observation , each group of mice was further divided into three subgroups ."
"for each eeriment , pooled sera , which contain an equal amount of serum of each vaccinated mouse in each group , were subjected to the assay as described by others .","the pseudotype virus was generated by cotransfecting t cells with two plasmids pcdna - sopt9 and pnl4 - 3 luc + env vpr carrying the optimized s gene and a human immunodeficiency virus type backbone , respectively ."
"after hr incubation , the infected cells were washed with pbs twice and then trypsinized ( 50 l / well trypsin ) .","briefly , the neutralizing activity of heat - inactivated sera ( 56 c , min ) was determined by mixing 5 pfu / ml of vtt - gfp virus in l with an equal amount of diluted serum at c , for h . after the incubation , l of the t cells were added into each well of the plate and incubated at c . t cells were diluted into / ml using culture medium containing % fbs , % streptomycin and penicillin , and g of cytosine arabinoside per ml ."
"in order to measure the long - lasting levels of nabs generated , we kept separate groups of the vaccinated animals for six months .","despite the virulent effects of vtt ( e . g . , body weight changes ) during the acute phase of vaccination , all mice survived for continuous observation ."
"here , the lack of detectable anti - s nabs after two consecutive mvtt - s challenges likely suggests a possible complete protection ( figure ( a ) ) .","notably , the s . c . vtt vaccination did not completely protect mice against i . n ."
nonpathogenic viral challenge model has previously been used to study the neutralizing antibody - mediated protection against immunodeficiency viral infection .,"we , however , recognize the limitation of our eerimental system because there might be major differences between lethal and nonpathogenic vaccinia challenge systems ."
this is often an issue for the clinical development of a vacciniabased vaccine .,previous studies indicated that mucosal vaccination overcomes preexisting antivaccinia immunity generated through skin vaccination .
"besides nabs , it is possible that the observed vtt - induced protection was partially contributed by cell - mediated immunity .",one limitation of our study is the lack of measurements of t - cell - mediated immunity .
